<START> when i think about this movie all the <UNK> that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world <UNK> smell color that's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young <UNK> asleep by the <UNK> or the <UNK> turkish bath and let it <UNK> your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flames <UNK> <UNK> don't just watch and listen be absorbed let the <UNK> voice of the <UNK> <UNK> you
<START> very funny well crafted well acted <UNK> attention to detail a real window into a specific time and place in history could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe interesting how <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> the berlin <UNK> a definite 10
<START> i saw this movie on <UNK> night after having a really boring day i had no expectations those i had were rather negative being that the only movie i've ever watched jimmy in is the american version of taxi with queen <UNK> don't ask why but seriously this movie is so cute drew barrymore is always sweet but i almost fell in love with <UNK> character why can't i meet a cute nerd like that movies like that are excellent simple sweet and necessary sunday on a <UNK> i'm not even a sports fan but it's something about american movies with baseball that <UNK> me probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in <UNK> br br my first comment ever haha
<START> i can remember watching this for the first time when i was 9 years old i wanted to be one of the barbarian brothers this movie is still great one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short <UNK> that the barbarian brothers where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly plus you have chases a cage fight a dragon and yes even a bar <UNK> br br yes the acting is bad so that's why it's not a ten also the story line has received a lot of criticism i think it is quite original not to many movies in it's genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue br br i definitely recommend this film
<START> with a cast list like this one i expected far better <UNK> redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death the thing is she never tells her daughters anything except <UNK> advice to be happy all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da <UNK> code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from the <UNK> in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story's main characters either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn't work to create anything it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none i left wondering why good movies can't be written for women it really was a disappointment
<START> yes this was pure unbelievable condescending <UNK> we know that the french often have a <UNK> idea of the usa it's <UNK> and views towards sex as an american <UNK> who lives in france i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes and while some of these <UNK> notions may be true not one element of the <UNK> town portrayed in this film <UNK> real a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big where in the world would you find that a <UNK> box in a bar that plays only vintage <UNK> a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago but with no major gas station no <UNK> in the home no <UNK> no kids a population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other the adult males plant <UNK> <UNK> at the local <UNK> have <UNK> but don't <UNK> kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it and all with equal emotion the <UNK> french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual <UNK> the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in <UNK> by the mere breath of an <UNK> <UNK> to helping <UNK> this same 17 year old farm boy help i am so <UNK> and <UNK> by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is go see it for the a to z <UNK> on what to avoid gosh i hope i didn't ruin it for you
<START> at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films the guy is usually <UNK> with girls in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being <UNK> for 20 years br br one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a <UNK> attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs they've done the gross out movies they've done the let's act like all americans have a mental age of 15 where will they go next br br this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it
<START> there are few uplifting things to say about this but i can mention matt dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile as most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent we end up with movies like this br br lindsay <UNK> who surprised so much in mean girls has to make better decisions which roles to take here she can only fail br br children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children although still pretty dumb the ones in the theater i saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes and as a family sports movie this is horrible the better moments are in the beginning at the <UNK> creating some sentiment and later in the car bash fest creating some tension if you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here after a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part being able to leave the <UNK> in your own car
<START> i consider myself a great admirer of david lynch's works for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical lynch elements having seen most of his works i <UNK> thought i could predict lynch's next step i was dead wrong <UNK> is something i could have never imagined under the name of david lynch still after my <UNK> from the first shock i started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character and i drew the conclusion that all the <UNK> cruelty brutality and disgust presented here are <UNK> bits from reality being <UNK> by <UNK> it there are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize for they are either disgusting or horrible however they are surrounding us so i take the courage to say <UNK> focuses on these bits and pieces this is not a movie to enjoy though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange perverted sense of humor this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe with its simplicity <UNK> and absurdity take it as it is you don't have to like it it just exists and finally if you're <UNK> enough you'll find elements typical to lynch as well i recommend it for <UNK> people
<START> in this first episode of friends we are introduced to the 6 main characters of the series monica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chandler bing ross <UNK> joey <UNK> and eventually rachel green br br we discover that rachel a rich girl that is <UNK> friend from high school times left her fianc√© barry at the <UNK> since she discovered she didn't love him she also decides to live with monica and become independent from her father getting a new job as a waitress in central <UNK> br br ross for the other hand discovered his wife is a lesbian and lost her for susan her partner we see him moving to a new apartment during the episode br br monica in this episode makes out and eventually sleeps with paul the wine guy who gave her the excuse of being <UNK> since he divorced his wife but in reality he was just <UNK> her br br ps i just <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in this first season
<START> that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version br br despite all of the other comments written here i really prefer the bette davis version even though the novak version has a more coherent story line br br however <UNK> <UNK> raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a <UNK> girl who seems easily to become a prostitute br br and it is those raw emotions that <UNK> part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair of failure of <UNK> strong emotions that he <UNK> <UNK> mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without <UNK> she has no feelings of despair or of failure or of <UNK> rather she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era br br <UNK> portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was <UNK> almost through the the whole movie <UNK> mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he <UNK> her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she <UNK> arguably the most passionate <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> than <UNK> attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth i wiped my mouth <UNK> vulnerability was excellent <UNK> realism was monumental br br imdb votes <UNK>
<START> i wish that '70s show would come back on television it was the greatest show ever they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing but i wish it would come back and make more episodes please come back the show was absolutely hilarious you couldn't laugh without seeing an episode there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when hyde and jackie were going out with each other those were the best episodes that '70s show is the best it will be and always will be the best show ever it was really sad when the show ended they should make new episodes
<START> although it's an r rated movie i really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager br br why because there's no real plot no character development no funny jokes br br the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks pretty nice ones i might add to feast your eyes on br br i really can't understand why this movie has the american pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without <UNK> in being either of them br br my suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks but you're too shy to rent buy an erotic movie br br gave it 1 10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2 10 for the nice chicks
<START> i was living <UNK> when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie <UNK> on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene <UNK> from the <UNK> coming alive to the electric chair up through the <UNK> office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in <UNK> most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r <UNK> and wished i had a chance to do it again
<START> to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century br br a river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a <UNK> stand point great landscapes redford acting well br br unfortunately the story is bad if there is a story at all br br i felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrow minded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also <UNK> in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to <UNK> his brother's motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of <UNK> fun all there is is fly fishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his father br br the end is not surprising it is <UNK> from the very beginning br br definitely not a must see 3 10 br br
<START> there are movies and there are films movies are more often than not merely cinematic candy whereas films are true works of art <UNK> <UNK> is certainly well placed in the latter as most viewers i was highly impressed with the battle scenes but the <UNK> of the portrayal of the central character is what i consider to be the most sterling quality of the film having done everything possible to serve her country as a true daughter of <UNK> all the while in the <UNK> of <UNK> addiction die <UNK> is treated very <UNK> by the german high command despite all of her efforts the scene in which the <UNK> is being conveyed in the rear seat of a <UNK> <UNK> command auto alone desolate and <UNK> is perhaps one of the saddest yet <UNK> depictions of a <UNK> lot in life only the emotional pain presented by richard burton in the spy who came in from the cold comes close <UNK> <UNK> is a far deeper film than one may realize upon a <UNK> viewing i only wish that its producers would see fit to release it on dvd so that those who have never experienced it can and those who have seen it can again perhaps again and again enjoy this exceptional motion picture
<START> i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g it's good clean fun although some parts may be <UNK> by adults but children would never notice particularly the triangle between cruella le <UNK> and <UNK> faithful <UNK> <UNK> glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is <UNK> terrifying even when she is <UNK> of her fur loving ways she can <UNK> fear in the audience with her <UNK> that literally shake the theater i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her <UNK> as the dog loving ella all in all i will go see it again in theaters i found myself enjoying it so much
<START> this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose <UNK> <UNK> and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming <UNK> on her nose you could go to your local <UNK> store on a sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more <UNK> better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool dvd case this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of <UNK> students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
<START> two old men sitting on a park <UNK> i don t really have a problem with this scene only problem is that it s not a scene it s the entire movie br br <UNK> movies don t get anymore low concept than this they also don t get anymore boring than this either but there s worse to come because these two old men are <UNK> and cheese one is <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> communist while the other is <UNK> carter a former golden <UNK> champion who s also black let me see now a jew and a black man sitting on a park <UNK> getting along fine well i guess it s possible though unlikely but if this film has such an <UNK> scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype why make them loud <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who take <UNK> <UNK> slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930s br br stereotypes aside <UNK> <UNK> the problem with i m not <UNK> is that it s written for an entirely different <UNK> than cinema it s based on a stage play and it shows walter matthau <UNK> through his role as <UNK> while this <UNK> almost slept through the whole movie
<START> christopher <UNK> is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as <UNK> this movie could have been a classic had <UNK> performed as well as tom hanks in forrest <UNK> or dustin hoffman as raymond <UNK> in rain man or sean penn as sam dawson in i am sam br br too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by charlton heston <UNK> <UNK> shirley jones mike <UNK> and shelley winters were <UNK> 3 of 10
<START> i sense out there a mix of confusion and varying degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this film yes there are vampire stereotypes yes there are scientific stereotypes covered here even martial arts stereotypes all well and good and sure not all perfectly done however i sense one crucial point about this film is being overlooked the cultural significance of its location the film is set in <UNK> florida and does not try to avoid saying so that's a bold move in the film world today and a rare treat for fans of <UNK> films and indeed it may not be the last <UNK> is world renowned as a navy town an <UNK> town a <UNK> town and sometimes even as a <UNK> for political controversy rarely is it seen as a growing film town but that's all changing now more film companies are coming in to shoot and more native <UNK> are discovering the power of cinema for themselves this film is part of a growing trend of <UNK> based <UNK> films and more are on the way <UNK> is making a big noise in the global film community and by and by the world is taking more notice watch and listen world the <UNK> are coming like a virus
<START> the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and destruction mostly caused by stan but with ollie receiving the bulk of the punishment see the great 'the music <UNK> 1933 or <UNK> in a <UNK> 1932 as some some classic examples br br here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by <UNK> father the boys play it <UNK> in a <UNK> built around jokes and supposedly funny situations it doesn't come off it's merely another third rate tedious 30s comedy <UNK> only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their <UNK> gestures <UNK> finger <UNK> <UNK> blank stares etc or comic abilities br br the film begins with them running from the police since we never see or know why it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in colonel <UNK> mansion the premise for the <UNK> ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging they are not playing <UNK> and <UNK> in this film their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor br br stan could <UNK> and make whatever he would do funny but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here he's <UNK> by <UNK> too much dialog to <UNK> the plot but none of it rises much above the silly we are treated to endless third rate comedy <UNK> such as the running gag of not correctly <UNK> lord <UNK> name the call me a cab okay you're a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long <UNK> and a non <UNK> ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a <UNK> for two and james <UNK> is still doing his silent era full body takes and <UNK> <UNK> jumping <UNK> br br stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in <UNK> of the <UNK> 1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them be themselves in fact 1932 <UNK> seem to be their best years br br since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it i have to give it a 3
<START> the more i analyze this film the worse it becomes first of all why a <UNK> <UNK> that part was just stupid i mean why would a <UNK> trying to control the world rely on a <UNK> <UNK> is alexander stone really that <UNK> first he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world so he looks to the bible for ideas many of these ideas i might add really have no <UNK> for example the part of the the houses of <UNK> and <UNK> shall scream out in terror could have already happened it could have been have been the <UNK> burned during <UNK> and the <UNK> could very well have been the <UNK> blown up in <UNK> or something and <UNK> <UNK> family they had no part except to provide a family values <UNK> and <UNK> their eyes with water i might add that since casper van <UNK> <UNK> lane is only in his <UNK> or that's the impression that i had and has a ten year child he had his child during high school yeah there goes <UNK> family values also why did this film have to be so damn propaganda like i'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot <UNK> and manipulate it well so that we are <UNK> this film doesn't do that the <UNK> starts off well with michael <UNK> playing a priest who murders a <UNK> off some sort and steals the dead guy's <UNK> code then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of the two <UNK> tell him tell your master that we are here dominic <UNK> replies he already knows and points to a small <UNK> camera that part sent chills up my spine had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film i'll give michael york credit he does a fine job of acting out his character as does michael <UNK> but the good guys are horrible i've already went on about <UNK> family br br now that i'm over the acting i'll get on to plot this is obviously a <UNK> film since our beloved <UNK> of the <UNK> is portrayed as an <UNK> the world <UNK> plot i liked and found plausible and subtle as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well done also another <UNK> against the <UNK> their leaders are seen as <UNK> minded since <UNK> explains to the <UNK> that it's not the end of the world but the beginning of a new one also the <UNK> or <UNK> says their going to <UNK> from the world union <UNK> they used the <UNK> code to control the world whoever it was they wouldn't just <UNK> they'd send over <UNK> and kill them this is the equivalent of america knowing about the <UNK> going to kill the president and simply saying we're not going to talk to you any more come on i did enjoy the scenes where we see <UNK> headed towards israel and see them again on the <UNK> mediocre in short
<START> at least for a half hour a week i haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks abc cbs nbc in years all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter most of the other characters are interesting as well the <UNK> of <UNK> and roy is entertaining at times too the animation is top notch and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show usually when they hire big names to star in a show they're trying to hide a poor script or characters not entirely true in this show though there's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting but overall the characters stand on their own br br this is definitely for 16 and up there's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads it's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it one example is that it makes fun of both dick <UNK> and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode br br father of the pride and other <UNK> productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and the brain and <UNK> it's the same type of humor grown up it may not be as witty as spielberg's classic tv series but it's still good br br i hope that it finishes this season off well and is <UNK> for future seasons otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again
<START> i just want to say that i am so glad somebody finally <UNK> the <UNK> on this movie bravo the <UNK> bravo this movie is a ridiculous farce of film making especially for a student film i just want to give credit to the <UNK> for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then to comment on it most people i know don't have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it kudos to you sir anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly i understand the idea behind creating a satire of charlie's angels but why hire such atrocious actresses also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture choose one job and put all your love into it man it's such a shame because i hear he made a good movie about a killer <UNK> again thanks to the <UNK> for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find
<START> a couple of <UNK> struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung paul muni buys o <UNK> his future wife who becomes his slave luis rainer american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and <UNK> old stereotypes and <UNK> ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras <UNK> big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors <UNK> rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her <UNK> face builds a <UNK> between her and the audience o <UNK> is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions
<START> i watched this last night with low expectations the reasons being i don't usually like made for tv movies and rarely have i liked cast reunion movies but the critic in the los angeles times seemed to like this so i gave it a chance i'm glad i did it was pretty good adam west and burt ward reunite as themselves but in a way they were acting as their batman and robin <UNK> they were being campy and not taking themselves or this movie too seriously the movie starts out with them searching for the george <UNK> designed <UNK> that someone stole before it was to be <UNK> off for an <UNK> home while they are searching for the car they are also <UNK> about the series that they did together this is told in flashback it was well done the actors that they got for the younger burt ward and adam west were dead on and for a tv movie it got down to the <UNK> gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen i give this one a 9 10 i liked it that much
<START> any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re write of the <UNK> fairytale they'll be singing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before they can even <UNK> a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days it is a classic for all children especially those adults who are young at heart
<START> john carradine john ireland and faith <UNK> who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this grade g horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion br br for carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those <UNK> coming in with that magnificent <UNK> voice of his carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not <UNK> in the least in what he appeared in br br he plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion who movie director john ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film it's even got a graveyard but with a missing <UNK> faith <UNK> is <UNK> aging star and carole wells is the young <UNK> br br in the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already the script is so incoherent i'm still trying to figure out the point i won't waste any more gray matter on it
<START> i was at the same screenwriters <UNK> and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly <UNK> what the film was about however the movie really didn't need explanation i thought the themes were <UNK> clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from <UNK> figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace life's possibilities is a film to be <UNK> and <UNK> i enjoyed it much more than the much hyped <UNK> ' i also think <UNK> was a bit <UNK> to hugo <UNK> as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been <UNK> recently but <UNK> delivers the goods i'm glad i saw it
<START> you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story believing it all then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly <UNK> and then put back together again brilliant br br one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary i don't know if other than andrew <UNK> capturing the <UNK> there has ever been anything like anna <UNK> forbidden lie it features exposes <UNK> reveals and questions everything about norma <UNK> author of honor lost the acclaimed and <UNK> 2001 <UNK> about honor killings in jordan br br what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this exposure of <UNK> is made with <UNK> full participation br br for the initial portion of the film <UNK> presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in <UNK> the story of the book she sounds completely believable convincing br br then her story is taken apart exposed by <UNK> believable and convincing people such as women's rights <UNK> in jordan <UNK> <UNK> there and in australia where <UNK> lived for a while br br <UNK> comes back and <UNK> the <UNK> taking a successful lie <UNK> test in the process there comes another segment of devastating <UNK> not to be <UNK> here because that would <UNK> the shock value and then <UNK> comes back and faces the <UNK> not all but the essential ones in the matter of the book br br and the <UNK> act continues with round after round in this heavy weight <UNK> prize fight surprise after surprise and there is no happy ending in the sense of resolution brilliant
<START> you can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and i had expected it to be campy anyway it's not all that campy in reality with the exception of kevin <UNK> and <UNK> ritter who don't take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight <UNK> smith is exceptionally bad the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra low budget horror movies was to <UNK> to the <UNK> sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and <UNK> in the script to get their point across although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of <UNK> and the soft core <UNK> which aren't all that edgy i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason the film is grainy with a tv quality look and acting level there are a few sexy scenes that are alright the boys <UNK> in bed in their <UNK> feeling themselves up or being tied down and making <UNK> faces while wine is <UNK> on them and some of them are kinda funny and i liked the <UNK> at l ron <UNK> and the intended irony of a story about religious <UNK> told with intense gay overtones but it still isn't any good 3 10
<START> i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen king's book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book <UNK> character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but he's not in an <UNK> he's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's i guess you'd call them <UNK> who bear absolutely no <UNK> to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute garbage there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold <UNK> as an actor but he messed up with this one
<START> this has to be one of the most beautiful moving thought provoking films around it's good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved every time i see the ghost of <UNK> riding the bike through the <UNK> at the end i can't help but cry my eyes out john <UNK> performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us gone but not forgotten a outstanding film full marks
<START> so often a band will get together for a re union concert only to find that they just can't get it together not so here this concert is just <UNK> brilliance from start to finish these three musicians obviously got together beforehand and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego this is obvious from the start before they even step on stage many faces in the crowd weren't even born when these guys first performed from the first song they capture that old magic that was cream 3 men 3 <UNK> no fuss <UNK> by his own admission said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no <UNK> <UNK> etc so we get to see him at his best ginger baker demonstrates why so many <UNK> today speak of him as some sort of <UNK> guru jack bruce just great they really managed to put together a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years to come this one's a 10 for me
<START> infamous pre code film really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly <UNK> barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose <UNK> selling father has no problem <UNK> her out to customers when he dies in an accident she's released out into the world with the knowledge that her <UNK> body can get her whatever she wants she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder one bed at a time although obviously there's no actual sex shown the film is quite sleazy unfortunately after the initial shock value fades around the time stanwyck <UNK> a <UNK> car inspector so she can travel for free the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through as always she's fantastic
<START> this was different that's for sure just look at the cast talk about <UNK> br br william h macy and ben stiller were the stars although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight in this farce about superhero <UNK> the most outrageous was played by paul <UNK> of pee wee herman fame br br there is lots of humor <UNK> colors and no <UNK> it's a pretty entertaining lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters all of whom want to be heroes a la superman batman <UNK> you name they have talents in strange areas however that the real heroes don't and don't want to it's silly but you know that going on br br it's also a film you can watch in <UNK> and not really miss any continuity it's a long movie for one so <UNK> so taking a break here and there is okay the language was tame so kids could enjoy this too in fact i don't recall any swearing in here except the guy in the theater next to me who kept <UNK> what a dumb f ing movie i thought it was fun two hours but i'd rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks
<START> i went to see this film with fairly low expectations <UNK> it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn't even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids ages 10 and 13 and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would <UNK> this script even the reliable fred <UNK> couldn't save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie i use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing
<START> peter ustinov plays an <UNK> who is just getting out of prison when the film begins as soon as he walks out the gates he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a <UNK> by stealing though this time he has his sights set pretty high this is actually one of the weak points about the film as he apparently knows nothing about computers few did back in 1968 but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight yeah right anyway he comes up with a scheme to <UNK> a computer expert and obtain a job with a large american corporation so he can eventually <UNK> a ton of cash considering his knowledge of computers is <UNK> it's amazing how he puts into effect a brilliant plan and manages to <UNK> the computer system and its <UNK> but it's a movie after all so i was able to suspend disbelief by the end of the film he and his new wife maggie smith are able to run away with a million pounds br br at the very end though it gets very very confusing and smith <UNK> she's managed to actually <UNK> more than two million by <UNK> <UNK> in the companies that ustinov started though she didn't realize they were all <UNK> companies this should mean that eventually these <UNK> she bought were worthless what they seem to imply and i could be guessing wrong here is that ustinov and his new partners quickly <UNK> in the <UNK> before this became known and the <UNK> would thereby then become worthless either way the film seems to post on a magical ending <UNK> no one is hurt and everyone is happy and this just didn't make much sense it's a shame really as the acting and most of the writing was great karl malden bob <UNK> peter ustinov and maggie smith were just wonderful br br if i seem to have interpreted the end let me know as the film seemed very vague in details at the end
<START> this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film he was both funny and sad carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan nolan blames god morgan freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life then god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers as i said before carrey did an excellent job i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actor actress the plot was good because it had many <UNK> in the main point this movie can be funny <UNK> dog as well as sad the break up the script worked well too i am glad they made a sequel to this film i rate this film a 9 10
<START> this is a movie about how men think women think about love no woman describes a one night sexual encounter and declares it a love story br br of the ten monologues i felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them i kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better enough br br this is an interesting concept and i kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded maybe if they actually were love stories it would have worked
<START> unbelievable br br this film gets a 7 out <UNK> 10 this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad the storyline if you can call it that was just as bad <UNK> everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes which is not a bad thing if you can <UNK> the audience during leading up to that moment that however is not the case there is no action no suspense not even a spark between the 2 leading actors it was unfortunately a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money br br and the 2 of merely for trying
<START> <UNK> meets the mafia telly <UNK> is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable i never thought that his show was all that great this is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss with very predictable results if you take the car chases and the general rambling out there isn't much plot development or action i find mafia movies to be dull because i have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions hollywood and in this case the italian cinema treat these guys as heroes i saw the film and in a few days i won't remember much about it lots of shooting innocent <UNK> dying betrayal and that sick loyalty the film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent but the dubbing is so bad due to voices that just couldn't come out of those bodies that i almost started looking for godzilla approaching the bay
<START> this film was done in really poor taste the script was really bad i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b movie adaptation of one of <UNK> greatest <UNK> the movie was politically incorrect and downright <UNK> to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 there was a scene where i almost <UNK> it showed macarthur in a <UNK> in <UNK> island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded one <UNK> <UNK> soldier the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says no <UNK> no mama no uncle <UNK> and macarthur gives his little <UNK> talk that americans would never <UNK> the <UNK> the scene ends with the soldier being <UNK> by <UNK> words and gives him a smart <UNK> i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u s as the great white <UNK> of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake it showed that <UNK> are <UNK> in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption it blatantly and <UNK> overshadowed the <UNK> of the members of the <UNK> united states armed forces of the far east these are <UNK> <UNK> that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese who walked side by side with americans in the death march of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> island by <UNK> a <UNK> offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous i shall <UNK> speech my late grandfather a <UNK> world war 2 veteran and <UNK> soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence <UNK> for his famous return in the <UNK> <UNK> landing
<START> <UNK> starts in deepest darkest <UNK> looks more like a dirt road to me where <UNK> simon <UNK> harvey <UNK> his son paul charles <UNK> are on an expedition simon thinks that ancient aztec buildings were in fact <UNK> control <UNK> he is on a mission to gain proof that alien <UNK> have visited earth while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his <UNK> takes back home with him to the small american town of <UNK> in california simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery simon <UNK> paul his wife cindy <UNK> van der <UNK> to take care of it meanwhile simon's brother fast food businessman cecil <UNK> harvey <UNK> again steals the creature so his brother won't make any money out of it but his idiotic <UNK> dude jon <UNK> has a fight with it chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the <UNK> br br directed by <UNK> <UNK> this has to be one of the worst horror <UNK> ever if not the worst the script by lance smith is so unfunny it's painful every joke in <UNK> misses the target by the proverbial mile i doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre teens there just isn't anything even remotely funny or even amusing in <UNK> as far as i'm concerned the basic story is crap too they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is why no ones ever seen it before how it manages to learn english so quickly how it learns to drive etc the whole thing is a big <UNK> 1984 rip off with none of the elements that made that film so good the character's are moronic the stupid deputy charlie phillips his dad hardy <UNK> cecil wearing an embarrassing wig fake <UNK> his air head wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more besides they just plain embarrass are ridiculous i defy anyone to find any of this <UNK> rubbish funny basically <UNK> fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror ends up being yes you've guessed it crap br br director <UNK> was obviously working with a low budget here it shows the entire thing takes place in two houses the desert some <UNK> a <UNK> golf course this is really cheap incompetent film making the special effects on the <UNK> themselves are really awful their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it's arm i cannot stress how bad the effects are these things wouldn't convince my 4 year old nephew as proved by me him yesterday total incompetence all the way this film sucks br br technically the film is terrible bad special effects lame production design rubbish sets well just <UNK> crap the acting is rotten through through from the cops to <UNK> who has two roles both of which prove he can't act isn't funny br br <UNK> is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve sure watch it if you want i won't stop you but just don't say you weren't warned my advice would be to watch <UNK> again instead but the decision is yours
<START> a masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about a chinese ghost story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology the film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt of course it happens to be haunted as well br br what i wasn't expecting the first time i saw this film is that it's one of the most touching love stories i've ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in <UNK> unlike some films of asian cinema a chinese ghost story isn't hard to swallow for those that aren't <UNK> in chinese culture indeed it plays on timeless <UNK> themes of the <UNK> and romance br br think evil dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix this film is for real despite being overlooked by many it's absolutely among the best i've ever seen it's ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic highly recommended 10 10
<START> this is a really fun <UNK> light hearted romantic comedy you cannot go wrong with meg <UNK> cute <UNK> combined with albert <UNK> genius normally i'm not a fan of completely <UNK> fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this one br br it's the 1950's <UNK> new jersey in the spring the story revolves around a pretty young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> catherine meg ryan who is all set to marry a <UNK> jerk a <UNK> <UNK> named james merely because he has the brains she's looking for in the father of her future children however it's love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed tim robbins as she doesn't think ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than albert einstein plays match maker <UNK> in his <UNK> by three mischievous <UNK> all <UNK> <UNK> uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart so <UNK> a <UNK> portraying him as a <UNK> naturally with amusing results br br walter matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively with his three <UNK> buddies kurt nathan and boris a lot of laughs ensue the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one outrageous step further if you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happening br br it might not be rocket science despite its main character but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie one of the best of the comedy romance genre
<START> the men in white movie is definitely one of the funniest if not the funniest comedy movies i ever watched and i watched quite a lot it is about two <UNK> who become men in white and then stop an invasion from space it is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as men in black star wars or dr <UNK> anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head there are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard it happened to me if you can watch this movie on tv watch it now you certainly won't regret it
<START> i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high <UNK> with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some <UNK> as in the big knife br br but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as <UNK> <UNK> only here the actors don't care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she's doing in this film i don't even want to compare her to <UNK> <UNK> in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high <UNK> but that definitely doesn't add any quality to the film br br it's a waste of time if you've seen high <UNK> before otherwise why not see a pseudo film noir as for me i'd rather die than see it one more time
<START> if you haven't seen this it's terrible it is pure trash i saw this about 17 years ago and i'm still screwed up from it
<START> not only is this film entertaining with excellent comedic acting but also interesting politically it was made at the end of the soviet union but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through the story is set during the early days of the soviet union and it questions the <UNK> behind the revolution both in cultural and practical terms of course by the late 80s and early 90s the bizarre <UNK> of soviet society are already relaxed but the ideology and mentality is still alive and well and ready for some well deserved <UNK> happily all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package br br <UNK>
<START> my friends and i walked out after 15 minutes and we weren't the first afterwards we tried to get our money back movie theater management wouldn't allow this but they did agree to let us see another film the only time that worked for us was to see <UNK> roberts former child star as you can tell this wasn't a memorable night probably one of my worst movie nights close second has to be when i saw a double <UNK> of domestic <UNK> and heist in conclusion for the sake of humanity please don't see the order
<START> this is surprisingly above average slasher that's enjoyable and well made with some decent gore all the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus molly <UNK> played the annoying bitch extremely well i bought this at a <UNK> shop for a 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy the finale was really cool as i loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for <UNK> were surprisingly pretty likable it's <UNK> made and written and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive this killer didn't mess around and i loved it and slasher fans like myself should really enjoy this film plus the opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie this is a surprisingly above average slasher that's enjoyable and well made with some decent gore and i say it's well worth the watch the direction is good <UNK> <UNK> does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace the acting is solid molly <UNK> plays the bitch extremely well and i had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much i'm surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job frank roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didn't mess around he was fantastic <UNK> <UNK> plays a bitch very well in her small role jessica <UNK> is cute and does fine as the other heroine rest of the cast are fine overall well worth the watch out of 5
<START> now look i won't lie to you but i only got this movie for 3 99 from a friend because it had <UNK> filth the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band cradle of filth in it i expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what mr filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot line br br but dear god i was oh so wrong this movie seriously bites big time being a low budget film haha wait make that zero budget this obviously lacks the beautiful howard stern orchestra musical scores and the spielberg special effects nope it's all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenes br br take for example when our star and violent fiend mr filth violently kills a <UNK> a grab at the throat and blood <UNK> out but oh my it looks like there's a juice <UNK> filled with fake blood in the man's shirt br br to you cradle of filth fans you'll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song down br br my final comment steer well away from it it's blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it so if you like appalling violence near no voices yes there's hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it but if shoddy movies isn't your thing then avoid it don't waste your money
<START> often <UNK> as a comedy the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there br br sidney <UNK> is an eccentric <UNK> who isn't getting the chances to <UNK> his <UNK> on the world because nobody pays him notice he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were after <UNK> his way into <UNK> <UNK> mill he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of <UNK> a fabric that not only never wears out but also never needs to be <UNK> he is at first <UNK> a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him but then the doom <UNK> of an industry going bust <UNK> its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary br br yes the film is very funny in fact some scenes are <UNK> hilarious but it's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me the <UNK> about the <UNK> of technology is a crucial theme here do we want <UNK> that save us <UNK> whilst closing down <UNK> you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i'm on about the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note the making of nuclear weapons became more than just <UNK> science was <UNK> to <UNK> new proportions you watch this film and see the quick <UNK> of events for the main protagonist stanley from hero to enemy in one foul <UNK> a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind it's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit br br i honestly can't find anything wrong in this film the script from roger <UNK> john <UNK> and director alex <UNK> could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the <UNK> and thought of mind it has the sound and setting is tremendous the direction is <UNK> with the <UNK> shift <UNK> handled by <UNK> some of the scenes are just wonderful one in particular <UNK> on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch's elephant man some <UNK> years later and yet after such a <UNK> of events the film still manages to take a <UNK> as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers <UNK> not only the future of stanley but also the rest of us in this rapidly <UNK> world br br a timeless masterpiece <UNK> and as a piece of art 10 10
<START> i'm going to review the 2 films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered and watched when i talk about 'the <UNK> i am talking about parts 1 2 together when watched one after the other as they should be br br thank you jon anderson steven soderbergh <UNK> del toro br br this film is a refreshing bold gritty and true film and it <UNK> a new style of film making no faux drama no <UNK> sound track not faux documentary style just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts i have been reading jon <UNK> che guevara a revolutionary life and recently finished <UNK> auto biography and this had helped my ability to <UNK> this film in properly but i have to say that it is jon <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone anderson was <UNK> on this film or these 2 films what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean no <UNK> music or slow motion photography to <UNK> drama and even more importantly no fake documentary shaky camera just square shots and straight forward shooting style the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle <UNK> del toro should be given full <UNK> for this i never <UNK> him as che throughout the film not once he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this some people complain that the film only deals with 2 <UNK> of his life and not the whole but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film it doesn't try to be everything it doesn't try to <UNK> the <UNK> a person's life is too <UNK> to try and tell in 2 4 8 16 or <UNK> hours this is one of the subtle <UNK> of this film it <UNK> that temptation and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che his developing <UNK> mind and the forces around him it focuses on 3 <UNK> of time the battle to over throw <UNK> che's u n speech and the gorilla <UNK> in bolivia motorcycle <UNK> already told his young man side and i applaud s soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead i keep referring to jon <UNK> book and the film stays true the only weak link for me are the casting not the performance of matt damon in a film so loaded with true to life performances an american matt damon playing a <UNK> is a clunky stretch he does well but after so much care in the casting this was an over site small and completely forgiven the reality that the rest of the casting gives you and most notably <UNK> del <UNK> amazing job <UNK> this film at the top of my list br br the fact that this film went almost straight to video <UNK> something about how the cold war <UNK> that would never allow the <UNK> <UNK> to become what it might have are still at work keeping it's story quiet if not out of <UNK> <UNK> then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has <UNK> this topic br br this is a must see film and jon <UNK> che guevara a revolutionary life is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the <UNK> of international political financial chess moves of the 40's 50's 60's that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors and the effects it <UNK>
<START> boring minimal plot no character development i went into this movie with high expectations from the book it could have been an awesome movie it could have probably become a cult classic nope it was a giant let down it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys the rebels or the military or the church or all of them i am still left puzzled by certain mini plots from the movie i am left <UNK> as to certain aspects of this so called prophecy which is never really fully explained i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini series on the sci fi channel it seemed very much like a made for tv movie don't go see this movie it is a waste of time and money
<START> whilst it is universally acknowledged that <UNK> <UNK> was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been they are they will be whether this makes it a rip off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point as a huge fan of both series i <UNK> to the latter belief although the less <UNK> may not do james <UNK> was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the <UNK> being an absolute gem lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack <UNK> <UNK> with menace as ed <UNK> forget <UNK> <UNK> dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file
<START> i read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private ryan i was expecting a film of some substance br br the film starts off very <UNK> sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being but immediately it's 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is the accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be <UNK> asian american but everyone speaks in a very poor take on <UNK> english imitation of a japanese person br br i gave this film 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes i couldn't watch any more of it the characters were 1 dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people i had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them very poor direction of a very average tv movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel i'd avoid and look out for better efforts br br this is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling you got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie my advice avoid and watch band of brothers <UNK> <UNK> glory or any other movie like when <UNK> fade
<START> the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father br br the brilliant dialog lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the <UNK> that keeps <UNK> back layers br br the core issues of <UNK> communication and <UNK> are explored <UNK> br br in fun ways the curtain is pulled back the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed br br all of this happens amidst a road trip format the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors wow
<START> if you want scream or anything like the big studio horror product that we get forced on us these days don't bother this well written film kept me up thinking about all it had to say importance of myth in our lives to make it make sense how children interpret the world and the violence in it our <UNK> of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends all here but not <UNK> on the surface you could technically call it a monster movie even though the wendigo does not take physical form until the end and then it's even up to you and your beliefs as to what's happening with the legendary spirit beast some standard thriller elements for those looking just for the <UNK> and the film never <UNK> though in fact the less you see of the creature the better <UNK> successfully continues george romero's tradition of using the genre as <UNK> and as a discussion forum while still keeping us <UNK> out
<START> before i comment about this movie you should realize that when i saw this movie i expected the typical crap horror b movie and just wanted to have fun jack frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that i've seen in a long time scott <UNK> is great as jack frost in fact i think he has a future in being <UNK> in big time movies if ever given the chance <UNK> is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements as soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people though you will find it hard not to laugh the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny the fact that the rest of the cast completely over acts just adds to stupidity of the film but it's stupidity is it's genius the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in b movie horror film fashion i truly hope there is a sequel and i'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it of course it's only fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology but i just like to see <UNK> kill people i gave it a 7 out of 10 this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours
<START> this movie is a horrible <UNK> of lies and <UNK> that were put together by the most shameless <UNK> to ever work on a tv movie the story is wrong and a complete lie there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy it's just a horrible <UNK> and it <UNK> me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry the <UNK> <UNK> who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been <UNK> by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism unfortunately for these communist nut jobs ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn't stop him thus the end of the soviet union and its' <UNK> br br never ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding <UNK> mccarthy read ann <UNK> book <UNK> for a better look at the truth about <UNK> mccarthy br br it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading http www <UNK> com <UNK> 1996 <UNK> <UNK> mccarthy <UNK>
<START> charming in every way this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good if you love jazz music it is a must see if you enjoy seeing <UNK> characters that make you smile can bring a tear to your eye and swing like there's no tomorrow this film is for you if you are looking for an intense deep heavy piece of art to be <UNK> and <UNK> perhaps you best stick with something by darren <UNK> in other words reviewer <UNK> <UNK> up don't you know a good time when you see one my only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short i guess i'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill
<START> this movie is nothing but a religious <UNK> promoting classic <UNK> and new age <UNK> dressed up with western images to be <UNK> by those who are ignorant of <UNK> religious comparisons basic <UNK> of <UNK> contain elements of reincarnation some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the <UNK> obviously <UNK> god is an <UNK> force animal life and plant life are all the same this is <UNK> <UNK> has tried to mix eastern <UNK> with western <UNK> his attempt at <UNK> may fool or confuse those who are not <UNK> of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality as the ad in the old berkeley <UNK> used to say for 10 00 will show you how to start your own religion as one famous prophet has said use the force luke
<START> <UNK> mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised it isn't completely faithful to the book but does it have to be no not at all john <UNK> is <UNK> as tom <UNK> his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol after inspector morse this is <UNK> finest hour he was matched <UNK> by a young nick robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an <UNK> <UNK> by the abusive relationship with his mother the script and music made it worth the buy and you also see <UNK> playing the <UNK> amazing the most moving scene was willie finding out about <UNK> death and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of <UNK> buy this you'll love it 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i can't figure al pacino out i watch him in the godfather scarface carlito's way and i think i am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years then i see him in two for the money any given sunday and revolution and i wonder what the guy is thinking br br i stumbled on revolution a few nights ago and thought i would <UNK> the next two hours on this here is a news flash want to get prisoners to talk force them to watch this over and over they'll confess to anything br br i won't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot but it does take place during the american revolution and pacino plays an <UNK> <UNK> who does not want to get involved but ultimately does while he has no money no education and dresses like a <UNK> a very hot natasha kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason since they have only two minutes of dialogue together br br quite frankly if al smith starred in this movie instead of al pacino it would have ruined their career the script was horrible but <UNK> <UNK> performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse donald <UNK> role was laughable i really can't describe it natasha kinski is a main character but has like 5 lines in the movie in fact nobody speaks much in this movie br br one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield its like the entire <UNK> is a <UNK> hey funny to see you here again on another battlefield 100 miles away see you in a few months br br i am required to give this one star by imdb since there is nothing here for a negative score
<START> okay i remember watching the first one and boy did it suck after watching it i just laughed it off and told myself oh boy just another low budget b movie i'll never see a part 2 to this one then about 1 1 2 years later there came part two it sucked even more but i just laughed it off again and said there's no way i'm ever gonna see a part 3 to this one then about 1 2 a year later part 3 came out i was stupid enough to rent it and boy i just <UNK> after watching it god i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days just save yourself 7 50 and don't rent the whole series trust me it's worth every penny
<START> i'm tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy it's a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history braveheart <UNK> <UNK> gangs of new york <UNK> an american legend the last of the <UNK> all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
<START> a delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which <UNK> into run of the mill british tv farce the last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating despite this major plot and style flaw it's worth watching for the character acting and the unique <UNK> setting many fine little bits to <UNK> like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank <UNK> after the clerk has <UNK> the credit card made more <UNK> when we're not quite sure the card is not <UNK>
<START> this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 the way santa looks have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and 2 the evil <UNK> of satan <UNK> just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the <UNK> version or if you like a very good laugh i can't believe this is a children's movie
<START> this was a favorite of my childhood i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time now that i'm grown up and have a kid of my own i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie we watched it last friday and he liked it during <UNK> fight with the giant spider my son's hand <UNK> over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared is he gonna beat the spider <UNK> just watch you'll see he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old so bagdad under the <UNK> of <UNK> al <UNK> might as well be oz under <UNK> br br i think he especially liked how much of the <UNK> and <UNK> do were <UNK> by the boy thief and not the grown up king in fact if you <UNK> the film's narrative a bit the king is the <UNK> sidekick not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative adventurous young boys br br it's definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve my son will find it <UNK> or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented why does ahmad love the princess because the narrative demands it the <UNK> of abu to put himself in <UNK> repeatedly for the clueless love struck <UNK> king is equally improbable but to <UNK> about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses fifty foot <UNK> and the temple of the all seeing eye would be <UNK> in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy <UNK> at the movie's climax is tremendous as is the final shot of abu <UNK> flying away on his stolen magic carpet seeking some fun and adventure at last
<START> i loved this movie and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it or so it seems no this movie is not deep who cares these kinds of movies never are but strangely there is a message in it it's that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to be br br parker posey is great in this movie i've always thought that she bears some resemblance <UNK> to <UNK> hepburn so it's great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about <UNK> <UNK> is the desk set all <UNK> especially those with a sense of humor should see party girl br br i gave this movie an 8 it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards although there are some nice shots in it but it is incredibly charming and entertaining
<START> difficult to call the grudge a horror movie at best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments br br if one forgets the failed frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie he is again disappointed the acting is ok but not great the story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning while one is trying to get what's happening but toward the end one understands there is not much to understand scary elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason br br so yawn see this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do like cutting the <UNK> or looking at the clouds
<START> it wasn't me it was er my twin brother rupert bobby says to <UNK> when confronted about being over at <UNK> place i have used this line dozens of times over the years no one has yet to believe it though br br this movie is one of the all time best for sheer fun and <UNK> steven oliver was perfect for the part of <UNK> so much so that he was in <UNK> <UNK> beach as the same character not nearly as much screen time though br br nobody calls <UNK> a turd is another line for the ages this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission
<START> on stage tv or in a book 'the woman in <UNK> is an outstanding ghost story other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film but i thought i would add my <UNK> little review too the made for tv movie has a deliberately slow first act which chronicles the main character arthur as he goes about his business as a <UNK> in 1920s london i can understand why this might not appeal to all <UNK> nevertheless for me i love this british style of storytelling similar to any of the <UNK> ghost story for christmas adaptations of the great m r <UNK> work in the second act the ghost story kicks in as arthur is sent to the <UNK> by his boss to <UNK> up the affairs of a deceased client the third act relentlessly builds up to a spine <UNK> conclusion as a <UNK> i have seen the play i own the book dvd r and have the <UNK> audio book on my <UNK> too what is sure for me 'the women in <UNK> on any medium is a ghost story with few equals it is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 dvd release
<START> will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets let's give you 30 000 to make a movie and see what you come up with the guy got <UNK> zombies and a regular cast to work for free sure the acting is laughable at times yes the make up is not greatest you'll ever see but it's not the worst either if you want to see that go watch zombie nation with it's <UNK> zombies br br this is pure good old fashioned <UNK> film making todd is a <UNK> professional and an all around nice guy there are holes in the plot yes the plot does seem far fetched but what the hell i still love this movie i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to if anyone has ever tried to make a movie they know that just finishing it is an achievement in and of itself
<START> this is a film where the actors are all fine especially <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels <UNK> forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion in other words it feels like they are contrived movie scenes not like real life even if women who work at <UNK> <UNK> ever go out with one of their customers it just doesn't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film also when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film it feels artificial the way they look at each other seconds after arguing again the actors are all good and moments of this film are nice but overall yet another indie that could have used some <UNK> before production got rolling
<START> br br <UNK> shot actors portray exactly their role you get a real feeling watching <UNK> <UNK> from poverty to the most beautiful girl around a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times and can very well say that <UNK> de <UNK> the beauty prize miss europe is a major favorite in my silent film collection the <UNK> of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who <UNK> artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line
<START> one of the worst films i have seen to date pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help the only good point is gary <UNK> parts but this does not lift the film very much it lives up to its b film <UNK> and passes the test with flying colours a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift a gift you can ask for the <UNK> and send back for a complete <UNK> br br really bad br br 1 10
<START> last night i finished re watching jane eyre 1983 the bbc mini series adapted from charlotte <UNK> gothic romance novel which is <UNK> a classic of english literature with timothy dalton my favorite james bond as mr edward rochester and zelah clarke as jane eyre a poor <UNK> 18 year old girl a <UNK> at mr <UNK> estate <UNK> jane eyre has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11 years old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words this book is amazing and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it its beautiful language <UNK> <UNK> and surprisingly fresh the dialogs and above all two main characters and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers jane eyre has been adapted to tv and big screen many times 18 according to imdb the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles william hurt and charlotte <UNK> george c scott and <UNK> york <UNK> <UNK> and samantha <UNK> have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society laws religion by the differences in age backgrounds experiences and by the <UNK> mistakes that would hunt one for many years of all these films i've only seen one 300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class he was mr rochester <UNK> vibrant the force of nature powerful passionate sexy and tormented master of <UNK> zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet gentle intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but firm <UNK> br br added on september 17 2007 during the last two weeks i've seen five jane eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience there is something to admire in every adaptation of jane eyre even if not all of them are completely successful this version is still my favorite jane eyre film
<START> what more can i say the acting was almost without exception amateurish the directing and continuity were pitiful the <UNK> was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious one of the features on the dvd was labeled gag reel but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie br br one of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the dvd he said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded with <UNK> like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did br br perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster the <UNK> suit was a <UNK> ape suit per the <UNK> <UNK> feature on the dvd and rather looked it the mask and <UNK> were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store the cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an <UNK> video game
<START> beautiful to watch but what would be the first thing you would do the moment you discovered atlantis explore it here was a golden opportunity to take viewers <UNK> special instead disney <UNK> to the same old formula story telling
<START> scott is right the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good however the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies chinese <UNK> scenes in my opinion have never <UNK> the japanese in terms of entertainment value especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies japanese movies <UNK> example being the lone wolf and <UNK> series even though <UNK> in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most the sheer intensity of those moments made them better but this is one example where chinese <UNK> surpasses the japanese the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene if you haven't seen it you have to john woo is the man
<START> fortunately for us real mccoy fans most likely all baby <UNK> who grew up in the late 50's and 60's three of the adult actors actress appeared when they did for the reunion show in 2000 tony <UNK> and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter as enjoyable as it was to see luke sugar babe and <UNK> together again it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of <UNK> reed and michael <UNK> it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999 but i'm not sure how there is no information about <UNK> on the internet that i can find very curious why they were not even mentioned it was so <UNK> their absence from the reunion show that i suspect that the family of michael and <UNK> herself if still alive either 1 <UNK> to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted or 2 <UNK> could not find any trace of either michael or <UNK> like the rest of us they seemed to have <UNK> therefore it would be the <UNK> policy to leave them out of the conversation all together br br otherwise the retrospect on walter <UNK> was wonderfully done they made no bones about it it was grandpa who made the show such a success i remember as a child <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> walk and my parents laughing as i'm sure a million other children did back then one annoyance that did bother me a bit was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion at times <UNK> tony and kathleen to make a point in fact although tony <UNK> seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation he was not allowed to speak out and say too much during the reunion show unfortunate since i wanted to hear from all three equally all in all the reunion show was a real treat for me i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time br br <UNK>
<START> while it was filmed at a florida national guard site <UNK> totally reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> la firing <UNK> <UNK> areas <UNK> deep water and all the movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my <UNK> in 1974 the difference between the <UNK> year 1971 and mine of 1974 is all the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> knew they weren't going back to vietnam as it was pretty much all over so training was very relaxed not a challenge at all that was the <UNK> to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s which i know for a fact as i stayed in until 2004 i never heard anyone mention <UNK> but the army did have realistic vietnam training <UNK> at different <UNK> across the u s vietnam vets tell me that up to 1972 basic <UNK> could be pretty rough and rugged because the <UNK> had been there and were <UNK> to train vietnam bound men those skills to make it although that was not always the case both a <UNK> sergeant at <UNK> and later one of my vietnam vet <UNK> when we had become <UNK> at a basic training <UNK> at <UNK> bliss told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves this movie rates high
<START> maverick cop with family problems and <UNK> of using his gun ¬ñ check isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen ¬ñ check tasty looking love interest ¬ñ check <UNK> band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents ¬ñ check german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion ¬ñ check corny one liners ¬ñ check br br <UNK> me does this film take the wee wee or what the clich√©s come as thick and fast as an <UNK> and most of the cast just stand around <UNK> at just how bad the script is br br in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain complete with some <UNK> lines from the <UNK> we have all the usual action move <UNK> <UNK> off <UNK> as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have <UNK> off br br jack wild is the cop in full on john <UNK> mode here who even manages time for the <UNK> ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point br br in amidst this mess there are a few well known <UNK> faces who i can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with <UNK> dialogue and even <UNK> effects br br looking up this three <UNK> from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am <UNK> to find that this dud <UNK> not one but two sequels i have got to find these gems on dvd it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel well goodness knows one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third <UNK> br br still blind <UNK> of cheap dvd's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep <UNK> out material of this awful quality
<START> despite some negative comments this film has garnered in the imdb pages it's still worth a look as this is a story about survival and <UNK> between two different men with different <UNK> while in a difficult mission in the <UNK> jungle br br <UNK> director luis <UNK> takes us along to watch this thriller set in <UNK> the film has some good moments as <UNK> the veteran marine takes a newly arrived man recently sent to try to eliminate a notorious drug <UNK> head and the corrupt army general who might be the next president of the country the only problem miller has no experience in what he has been <UNK> to achieve br br miller the arrogant newly arrived man to the jungle and to the <UNK> <UNK> between the military and drug <UNK> against the <UNK> american intelligence men learns a valuable lesson from <UNK> what looks good in theory is irrelevant in the jungle br br tom berenger is an actor who doesn't register much as he proves in this movie but in the context of the movie he is right as a man of a few words billy zane playing miller does what he can with a role that doesn't afford him any glory until the crucial end br br for lovers of action film sniper offers an <UNK> minutes of action that with a bit of <UNK> would have made a more satisfying movie
<START> the show's <UNK> <UNK> sound effect used to put me to sleep a very <UNK> show i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on <UNK> <UNK> was shot in <UNK> springs florida i would assume lloyd bridges never <UNK> there i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge of the seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my <UNK> house imagining the <UNK> <UNK> sounds and <UNK> our adventures in our heads i thought <UNK> had better <UNK> action of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment
<START> <UNK> the edited version of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a struggle to sit through even at a lean <UNK> minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma br br jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a <UNK> since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever apparently this is one of the better of his <UNK> films ¬ñ it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there br br the <UNK> plot deals with <UNK> usual themes of sex violence and <UNK> and throws in a bit of s m for good measure and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious br br i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again ¬ñ life is too short to be spent watching <UNK> like this
<START> i only lasted <UNK> before self <UNK> <UNK> me out of the empty eyed <UNK> <UNK> that this film effortlessly induced and <UNK> me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear br br to say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard just to keep these comments clean br br one to be avoided br br
<START> no strings attached is one of carlos <UNK> best performances to date <UNK> is known for <UNK> and making fun of racial issues however he does more than that in this stand up performance which took place in san francisco in general <UNK> material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today br br in this hour long performance <UNK> talks about such things as illegal <UNK> what women really mean when they ask for <UNK> in the <UNK> terrorism his opinion of mel <UNK> passion of the christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by jesus and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped <UNK> even <UNK> whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke br br carlos <UNK> is not afraid to offend which at many times gets him trouble with his critics for example he does go somewhat far and he admits it with a joke regarding <UNK> john paul ii and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now br br <UNK> main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend he reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as americans br br if you enjoy this performance i definitely recommend watching mind of <UNK> his show on comedy central
<START> one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle tom <UNK> was amazing with out words could convey his feelings thoughts i actually sent mike ferrell some <UNK> money to help the film get distributed it is good system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff i was in the audience in seattle with <UNK> and director a writer i think and mike ferrell they talked for about an hour <UNK> not really a dry eye in the house why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know actually i do know it is our fault look what we watch well you get what you pay for guys get this and see it with someone special it is a gem
<START> this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie though i would rather watch the original japanese version americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who <UNK> humans for fun during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother a beautiful woman named <UNK> who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero or really bad he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain <UNK> who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending there would be a sequel to this one but it was not quite as good as this one however the ending was a bit more final than it was here
<START> let me first say i watched this movie around midnight and usually there only is trash around this hour but this movie broke the record br br first of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy yet he gets to f <UNK> all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop talks to a girl and then you see them f <UNK> br br secondly there are loads of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can f <UNK> br br <UNK> this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family this movie only shows soft bad acted <UNK> it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
<START> this is a terrible movie terrible script bad direction and nonsensical ending also bad performances except from <UNK> brown who is criminally underused here and michael <UNK> watching this movie was <UNK> you do it to <UNK> enough bad movie <UNK> to actually see a good one further down the line br br the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related the part of the male lead is not well written and seems <UNK> in this role you can see the plot points a mile away the actions of the female lead and that of her brother the cop also make no sense so a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script wise
<START> i was lucky enough to see zero day last night it's an amazing movie a very disturbing one at that br br in a way zero day is very comparable to the blair witch project it's shot <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> it's about 2 kids just your average kids andre and <UNK> they start a campaign against there high school entitled army of 2 br br the whole story is told in video diary form from the 2 kids it shows there relationships with there parents amongst other people showing that these are just normal kids just like people we know or who have <UNK> into we find out the army of <UNK> last mission will be <UNK> zero day they plan to shoot up there high school br br you see how they get access to there guns how they plan it out everything they stress that the media has not affected them at all and there is no reason for doing this like i said this is all told in video diary form and then they store the tapes in a safety <UNK> box to be seen after zero day br br the actual shooting is shown through <UNK> cameras throughout the school chilling indeed the movie is very chilling some of the things they say how they plan it out you'd just have to see it for yourself one quote that i remember is the only time <UNK> is <UNK> he says andre thinks were just gonna leave in some <UNK> car doing this to numerous schools across the country i don't know what he's thinking but the only way i'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag br br i'm <UNK> not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film you really need to see it yourself it's going around festivals right now br br a
<START> after the <UNK> and scooby doo left the saturday morning <UNK> in the fall of 1986 i pretty much stopped watching saturday morning cartoons at that point since those were the only two that kept me <UNK> in and since neither the real <UNK> nor the <UNK> kids seemed very promising to me i retired and started sleeping in on saturday <UNK> i only returned to saturday morning tv in 1988 for that one year only for one and only one animated show br br a new animated show of superman was something i was not going to pass up i was 17 and in high school at the time but so what i loved this show from what i can recall this series was a gift to fans i suppose in celebration of <UNK> <UNK> birthday that particular year it had the theme music and the music style reminiscent of john williams movie score from the richard <UNK> christopher reeve superman movies i honestly felt that the animation style ruby spears did was reminiscent of the super powers team <UNK> <UNK> series by <UNK> <UNK> a few years before sadly danny dark was not back as superman but i felt beau weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of superman and his clark kent was nerdy like the chris reeve version after hearing him as reed richards mr fantastic on the 90's fantastic four i could still see this version of superman in my mind <UNK> <UNK> as lois lane lol what a rhyme she was a voice director for <UNK> <UNK> and ruby spears and i guess she took it upon herself to do lois memories of the <UNK> <UNK> in this series when it came to the voice over cast jimmy olsen is mark taylor who on the <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> perry white is none other than former batman tv writer stanley ralph ross who on <UNK> was gorilla <UNK> and <UNK> in the super powers shows and lex luthor now a wise cracking <UNK> <UNK> is none other than <UNK> voice <UNK> michael bell whom i know best as <UNK> and the <UNK> as well as many other characters on many other series br br i felt this series was a combination of the movie superman along with the post crisis john <UNK> re <UNK> of superman with lex luthor as a <UNK> <UNK> jonathan and martha kent being alive to see clark as superman the bruce <UNK> series and lois and clark would also do this unfortunately we never saw <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> other than luthor we saw only the <UNK> and we did see general <UNK> i especially enjoyed that one episode with wonder woman who was voiced over by <UNK> ward who played her on the super powers team as well br br the episodes were <UNK> and i also enjoyed <UNK> growing and development stories from <UNK> to childhood to <UNK> to an adult moving to metropolis in the short little segment <UNK> family album br br the only two things i didn't like it only lasted one season and after wonder woman's guest spot i was hoping batman would turn up voiced over by adam west still thinking about the super powers team episodes i guess i also hoped for it because on the <UNK> episode the metropolis baseball team was <UNK> against the <UNK> <UNK> br br every popular super hero has one cartoon series that is ultra rare for <UNK> i feel it's the 1981 solo series that aired the same time as amazing friends for the incredible hulk it's the 1982 cartoon for the fantastic four it's the 1978 series with <UNK> the robot for batman it's the new adventures of batman 1977 by <UNK> featuring <UNK> but for superman the <UNK> series is this one br br superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it this is another series that wb should consider for dvd release all in all this 1988 version of superman is well super
<START> hi i'm from <UNK> california and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in <UNK> and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination we've beat <UNK> every game for the past 6 years and since i'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we've had running backs lead the state and i'm next if you want to know me i'm kyle taylor and i average seven to eight <UNK> a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
<START> this movie is just too funny a totally non pc gangster romp if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the 30's it would probably look like this too many great one liners to to remember and while its not for everyone anyone who <UNK> laugh a whole bunch of times <UNK> have a pulse so put it on and laugh you <UNK>
<START> the road <UNK> was a great show about <UNK> <UNK> chosen by the master to fight crime around the world the show was hilarious to say the least simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages running jokes throughout the series that could <UNK> a drinking game the action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up the characters were very original each with a very different personality but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext hopefully one day <UNK> be some way to watch the <UNK> in action again
<START> 1st the good news the 3 d is spectacularly well done and they don't go for the <UNK> gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz <UNK> br br and now the meat of the matter it's about flies for <UNK> flies with big <UNK> human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i <UNK> the underworld movies to rats vs <UNK> that wasn't intended as praise and i never <UNK> anyone would take it literally this one's got even less empathy going for it baby <UNK> ugh in one of those odd <UNK> of hollywood <UNK> this <UNK> was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space <UNK> also about <UNK> in space br br go rent apollo 13 and see a 9 rated movie about the real space program rip
<START> by far the most important <UNK> for any film following confidence <UNK> is that they must at least occasionally be able to pull one over on us as well as their dumb witted marks the cops the mob and <UNK> each other but this film never pulls this off every <UNK> can be seen coming a mile off especially the <UNK> neither are they very interesting intricate or sophisticated perhaps <UNK> hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships if so he failed the lines are alright but they're delivered in such a stilted unnatural <UNK> way that i thought perhaps some clever point was being made about us all acting all the time but it wasn't as for the psychological complexity the main character's a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced <UNK> slips about her father thinking she's a whore but she gets over it i really liked the street scenes though looked just like an edward hopper painting
<START> acting is horrible this film makes fast and furious look like an academy award winning film they throw a few boobs and <UNK> in there to try and keep you interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story there is a reason why people on the internet aren't even <UNK> this movie this movie sunk like an iron turd do not waste your time renting or even <UNK> it this film is and always will be a <UNK> turd i am now dumber for having watched it in fact this title should be referred to as a <UNK> turd from now on calling it a film is a travesty and insult <UNK> <UNK> appalling awful <UNK> cruel <UNK> <UNK> disgusting dreadful eerie <UNK> fairy <UNK> <UNK> ghastly grim grisly gruesome <UNK> hideous horrendous horrid <UNK> lousy lurid mean nasty obnoxious offensive <UNK> repulsive revolting <UNK> scary shameful shocking <UNK> terrible terrifying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the next to last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season though flawed <UNK> our <UNK> has its moments and overall a moody compelling feel to it kirk spock and mccoy <UNK> down to a planet assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever <UNK> is there since the <UNK> sun is due to explode within hours but as it turns out the people there are all too aware of the <UNK> fate and using a kind of time travel device have escaped into the past each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a <UNK> ' run by an elderly man named mr <UNK> <UNK> assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode with lines like br br mccoy where did they go <UNK> wherever they wanted to br br the <UNK> could be <UNK> up rather easily but for plot purposes it isn't and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age <UNK> years in the <UNK> past from here the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman <UNK> to this time by a <UNK> as punishment spock begins acting increasingly emotional showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for <UNK> the woman he eventually realizes that he is <UNK> back to the primitive emotional state of his <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> years ago kirk makes his way back to the library first and finally convinces mr <UNK> they don't belong in his <UNK> history spock and mccoy return just before it's too late leaving <UNK> behind the enterprise <UNK> the three up and <UNK> away as the sun explodes destroying the planet the interaction between spock and <UNK> provides this <UNK> most memorable moments though <UNK> adventure into the <UNK> past is amusing all in all a very decent latter day star trek outing
<START> i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didn't really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out loud br br with all due respect to george burns rip walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is amazing given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are first rate you know what kind of songs he wrote sh t and when speaking to the spanish speaking guy at the front desk no no no <UNK> absolutely hilarious br br kudos to richard benjamin who played straight man to matthau br br i just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit old br br i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
<START> after watching the first <UNK> of <UNK> sorry i couldn't take more of it i have now confirmed she does not br br basically this movie is an insult to the real french actors <UNK> in this <UNK> piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> avant jesus christ la <UNK> des <UNK> a historical movie with <UNK> tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a <UNK> of direction avoiding the <UNK> heavy comedy <UNK> br br unfortunately the <UNK> faced lou <UNK> ruins everything and <UNK> instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to <UNK> who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> struggling in the middle of this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> farce
<START> thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me <UNK> right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton heston sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had past experiences with james coburn <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> never <UNK> sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara <UNK> susan <UNK> the portrait of a lady <UNK> managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex <UNK> men who never seemed to leave her alone sam <UNK> had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
<START> raising victor vargas a review br br you know raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big steaming bowl of <UNK> it's warm and <UNK> but you're not sure if it feels right try as i might no matter how warm and <UNK> raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something didn't quite feel right victor vargas suffers from a certain <UNK> on the director's part apparently the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side and an <UNK> storyline would make the film critic proof he was right but it didn't fool me raising victor vargas is the story about a <UNK> year old boy called you guessed it victor vargas victor <UNK> who lives his teenage years chasing more <UNK> than the rolling stones could do in all the years they've <UNK> the movie starts off in ugly <UNK> <UNK> bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her but a cry from outside <UNK> his plans when his best friend harold kevin <UNK> comes a looking for him caught in the attempt by harold and his sister victor vargas runs off for damage control yet even with the embarrassing <UNK> that he's been <UNK> the <UNK> girl in the neighborhood nothing <UNK> young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat on a hot new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where <UNK> eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young <UNK> judy judy <UNK> who's not just pretty but a strong and independent too the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film the story also focuses on <UNK> family that is comprised of his grandmother or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his brother <UNK> also played by real life brother to victor <UNK> <UNK> and his sister <UNK> <UNK> rodriguez the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family victor tries to cope with being an <UNK> <UNK> daddy his feelings for judy and his <UNK> conservative catholic upbringing br br the problems that <UNK> from raising victor vargas are a few but glaring errors throughout the film you get to know certain characters like <UNK> <UNK> grandma judy and even <UNK> best friend <UNK> the problem is we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest <UNK> in the neighborhood we know that he knows how to <UNK> his lips and <UNK> his <UNK> and carry himself for the sake of <UNK> girls into the sack but that's all we know that <UNK> plays piano and quiet well you could see it by the awards on the family piano we know his sister <UNK> is a <UNK> loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv we know that grandma is a hard working traditional <UNK> woman who's trying to raise her kids with <UNK> in a world of excess corruption yet where is the titular character victor vargas he's in this movie somewhere but we only know what the movie tells us this is by far the film's biggest flaw victor vargas isn't so much a character but a <UNK> <UNK> ball <UNK> between scenes with judy and his grandmother but we never get to know who victor vargas really is this is important because as i've mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he's a sexually active teenager with a <UNK> the size of manhattan he's a total <UNK> male victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all why should anyone so by the end of the movie in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has <UNK> any depth and learned the errors of his ways how could such a two dimensional character have any depth if only the director had worried a little more about <UNK> out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand held shot br br raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner city neighborhood to the big screen something that few films have done before in the past the film has been <UNK> for feeling so real and i won't br br argue with that i haven't seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor seriously although the movie has some nice shots of the city the writer director peter <UNK> was way too <UNK> on close ups and hand held shots this problem is particularly noticed in <UNK> scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep breathing <UNK> to keep from passing out as the film continues the shots get <UNK> and <UNK> with faces <UNK> from brow to <UNK> on the screen you can practically smell victor <UNK> cheap <UNK> the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast the <UNK> scenes of inner city apartments make them look small and <UNK> which is not true i've been in those type apartments i used to live in one they're not <UNK> but they have high <UNK> and they're decent living spaces by the movie's standards you'd think that these apartments were <UNK> cells of brick and <UNK> <UNK> paint and <UNK> walls unfortunately <UNK> constant use of close ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom in on one scene come off as totally amateurish but raising victor vargas is only <UNK> second film and his most well known a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films one review i read <UNK> the movie as <UNK> for <UNK> sake ' and i cannot agree more if victor vargas were truly a great film and story then the characters' <UNK> wouldn't matter whether they were latino chinese etc yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle class <UNK> with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> white kids the results wouldn't be such glowing reviews and we'd see the film's flaws more clearly indeed some other aspects of the use of <UNK> in this film bother me while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question for example victor <UNK> and <UNK> all share the same room to sleep this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe any self <UNK> latino family wouldn't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen year old girl at first i was unsure perhaps i was wrong but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified considering how conservative the grandmother is you'd think that <UNK> would have been sleeping in her room br br as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full time i could relate to the movie in many ways which is why my critical <UNK> are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie unfortunately my lack of respect for victor vargas <UNK> my feelings for the film maybe it's because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my <UNK> <UNK> when i was <UNK> maybe it's because without any further <UNK> by the film victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot blooded latino <UNK> just end up shouting to girls from his car hey bay <UNK> <UNK> want to get into my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ' either way i don't like him so ultimately how can i like a film about him so if you'll excuse me i'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of <UNK> br br
<START> given its time of release the story that <UNK> in 1950 thriller <UNK> in the <UNK> was hardly a surprise the corpse of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and passed off as a nobody until further examination from a public health inspector who claims the corpse carries a strain of <UNK> plague yet with the current drama in the world today this strangely helps this film in appearing credible for today's viewers the cast and crew are flawless richard widmark in his first role following his breakthrough performance in <UNK> and the city ' jack palance in his chilling film debut also starring in this film are paul douglas and a young and rather cute barbara <UNK> <UNK> a whole slew of uncredited non professional actors typical of director kazan fill in the remaining <UNK> <UNK> kazan directs joe macdonald films he would later work with richard widmark again in <UNK> much superior <UNK> on south <UNK> and the great alfred newman scores it nearly everyone involved here has done better work <UNK> in the <UNK> is quite the rewarding watch nonetheless especially for the film noir <UNK>
<START> having grown up in texas and less than 15 miles from what used to be <UNK> i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of <UNK> do not live like this movie <UNK> the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it <UNK> the stereotypical image that all <UNK> are beer drinking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas <UNK> to most <UNK> accents but these people <UNK> it you can't get someone from new jersey and <UNK> to do texas accents it just doesn't work john travolta should have stuck to disco dancing or the 50s debra <UNK> was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a <UNK>
<START> definitely spoilers in this review i adore american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on <UNK> in the uk when i was 14 the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right it's small town supernatural <UNK> but with fantastic layered characters best of all and the reason i love it so much is it had the guts to never be black and white lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by as he says giving people enough rope to hang themselves with his manipulation only works because of other people's weak morals <UNK> though generally a thoughtful kind insightful boy can at times show the <UNK> dark side inherited from his father none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the <UNK> <UNK> showing a <UNK> side through reckless vengeance in the plague <UNK> not only that but having <UNK> the closest thing to a mother figure for <UNK> not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not <UNK> for it i'm a huge buffy fan but when that show tried to go really <UNK> in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it's humorous side and didn't commit fully to its ideas <UNK> shows that you can have a morally <UNK> character right at the heart of the show and still have a hell of laugh doing it br br i can't even think about why it was cancelled as i'll just get too angry at the <UNK> of it all so much rubbish on tv and good original shows get kicked around and <UNK> on thanks to the <UNK> of dvd at least i can see the show in it's entirety yes some of the visuals look dated now but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work br br the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it isn't like the x files where there are cases to <UNK> or lost where there's huge unanswered questions it's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers and that the show is all about fighting for <UNK> soul so this show might <UNK> people looking for a purpose or an unknown <UNK> to find yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects with some such as the truth about <UNK> parents getting resolved but unlike lost and x files this show isn't about trying to find out more <UNK> about what's going on imo it's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of <UNK> personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage br br all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out i'm pretty certain most fantasy horror fans will love it also even though it got cancelled all characters have <UNK> and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt having him not be in the final episodes is strange br br i would have done anything for a second season but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv <UNK> appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all
<START> from the creators of <UNK> ok that grabbed my attention br br well the creators of shrek also made <UNK> <UNK> was half as good as shrek br br and now <UNK> away is half as good as <UNK> br br that means <UNK> away isn't good the animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn't br br the story of this movie was only meant for kids it's seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick br br but there were many jokes meant for adults i bet kids <UNK> understand the jokes br br despite that i <UNK> like this flick br br i am completely disappointed 4 10
<START> i tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so i didn't know who had done it at first the longer i saw it the more i started thinking jesus this looks like an albert <UNK> flick wasn't quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the <UNK> desert scenery was beautiful and scott <UNK> gave an hilarious performance as simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor <UNK> must have ad <UNK> the many clever one liners he shot out because albert <UNK> hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately <UNK> doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone and the movie's the worse for it lance <UNK> playing the evil head cyborg <UNK> his way through his part as he's done in countless other movies like this i don't know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the <UNK> desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a <UNK> kathy long the <UNK> hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesn't have an <UNK> of acting talent but that doesn't matter in a movie like this this being an albert <UNK> film it's full of the <UNK> that we've all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah <UNK> ever notice br br as bad as this movie is however it's a <UNK> above most of <UNK> other efforts this is citizen kane compared to his brain numbing <UNK> feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great <UNK> it's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as <UNK> usual <UNK> you could do worse than rent this movie not much worse granted but worse nonetheless
<START> i don't know how or why this film has a <UNK> rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a <UNK> br br the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don't like the process of film don't like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic <UNK> br br this isn't a film that you will want to watch to <UNK> it's a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and care br br <UNK> may contain a spoiler or two br br the main thing about this film is that it <UNK> the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the <UNK> aren't real br br the film is like many films in one br br 1 a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena br br 2 a narrative about a filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he's supposed to work with br br 3 the film that <UNK> is making it's about a young woman named lena ie 2 who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie 1 she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of that br br the <UNK> and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellow blue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the <UNK> is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative br br another thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all i'll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great technique br br think of yellow as a living thing actual events in 14 scenes a complete tale br br think of blue as all the things in between the 14 scenes in yellow that you didn't see that is a complete tale on it's own br br essentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different ways br br it wasn't until i saw the first 30 minutes of blue that i fully understood yellow br br i hope this was helpful for people who are being <UNK> by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at film br br thanks for your time
<START> i had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so <UNK> my expectations were crushed but they were crushed more than should be expected the movie would have been a decent movie if i had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me br br in any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at <UNK> to a ship full of <UNK> slaves the scene at bishop <UNK> was fine in fact other than the <UNK> things survived up until the <UNK> of <UNK> because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute the worst she does is run into the <UNK> office and spit on his face <UNK> is entirely eliminated because having children out of <UNK> should also not be talked about <UNK> is <UNK> dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy <UNK> is able to <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> before the <UNK> affair so they reunite happily yet another change then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up thankfully it was saved after this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to <UNK> towards classic novel <UNK> br br as <UNK> and <UNK> are riding through the park they come across <UNK> giving a speech at a meeting about prison <UNK> when he comes to hand out <UNK> to <UNK> and <UNK> he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the tv set we aren't <UNK> i could hear victor hugo <UNK> in his grave of course they are <UNK> they want to revolt against the pseudo <UNK> that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters it's a historical fact that there was an <UNK> against the government in <UNK> br br at one point <UNK> goes to give <UNK> a <UNK> from her father for the <UNK> movement and meets <UNK> except not <UNK> or at least not the <UNK> of the book this <UNK> appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison <UNK> who are working out of the <UNK> universal as opposed to the <UNK> <UNK> not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her <UNK> mannerisms br br the prison <UNK> lead by the most poorly cast <UNK> that i have ever seen decide that <UNK> out <UNK> isn't good enough anymore so they're going to build <UNK> i don't know about you but i have never heard of <UNK> movements <UNK> up the streets and building <UNK> and attacking government troops about three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the national guard and building a bunch of <UNK> etc <UNK> does die for <UNK> thankfully br br the rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that <UNK> suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his <UNK> screen time and odd character interpretation the movie ends with <UNK> watching <UNK> jump into the river this is again inaccurate because <UNK> would never have let <UNK> <UNK> he saved the man's life earlier why let him die now then there's the whole skipping of <UNK> confession to <UNK> his <UNK> and his redemption on his <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> by his side br br overall i can blame the script mostly for the problems while i am glad <UNK> and <UNK> were at least present in the film they were terribly <UNK> as was the entire <UNK> scene the <UNK> of <UNK> suffering <UNK> us from feeling too much pity for her that <UNK> knows <UNK> past from the start <UNK> with the plot a good deal i did not even see <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> only had a few seconds of screen time the same with <UNK> i did like <UNK> <UNK> interpretation of <UNK> a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie on the other hand charles <UNK> for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with <UNK> the lip <UNK> the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong he also like many <UNK> i have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character br br again this film would probably feel much better if i had not read the book i would not recommend it to book <UNK> though i would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the <UNK> accurate french version come out the year before
<START> why oh why can't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale this is the second adaptation of beowulf i've been disappointed with in a year but i have to say the previous version beowulf grendel starring <UNK> butler was far superior to this that one was only a little disappointing this one is a mess br br what <UNK> me most was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason human sacrifices pointless love interest or the bad cgi or the <UNK> of the characters or the uninspired acting even worse was the way they made beautiful <UNK> <UNK> look so horrible and lets not even talk about that ridiculous <UNK> br br and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film he was tossed around by both monsters he fought relying on his <UNK> to save his bacon even when he <UNK> the arrogant prince he didn't knock him out he was much too <UNK> on weapons <UNK> <UNK> is more like it this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem br br i'd like to end this on a positive note but i can't really think of one <UNK> all i can say is if you've ever read beowulf you'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal inaccurate excuse for an adaptation
<START> 1st watched 11 <UNK> 2004 1 out of 10 <UNK> jon <UNK> over the top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like friday the 13th versions 1 thru <UNK> i can't think of much redeeming here except or can i think of anything <UNK> story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were <UNK> in the woods as an <UNK> to this supposedly but lo and behold one of the stupid people have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered again how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this guess what the murderer is at it again and we're <UNK> off from the very beginning who it is so there goes any mystery whatsoever and besides all this where are the <UNK> and why doesn't someone call them i can't believe this movie was <UNK> by someone and made you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher at least in their movie going experience but not so by this filmmaker
<START> 3 in young john <UNK> trilogy of blockbusters he dances to disco rock <UNK> roll and country he heads to <UNK> to find work and love <UNK> is the hot spot and it is the time of the mechanical bull not to be <UNK> i <UNK> the bull at a club in <UNK> i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year 1980 was i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta debra <UNK> was in her prime she looks stunning in her red top there is plenty of charisma bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash they split up just because it feels so good getting back together urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack we get to hear <UNK> eyes by the <UNK> and <UNK> for love by johnny lee
<START> br br when i first started watching this movie last night on <UNK> i was shocked that it had been made cruel intentions in my opinion was one of the best teen oriented films made in years this prequel had certain things <UNK> with the original <UNK> father married into wealth then why does he have a rich aunt on long island br br then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie but rather a television series <UNK> <UNK> after hearing that it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie just as buffy the vampire <UNK> is different in tv form br br i think that roger <UNK> most likely added the ending that this movie had after the series wasn't picked up by fox it just seems like something that would happen too fast sebastian becoming the male version of <UNK> and i just don't know where they would go with the next episode since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 film which the newer ending is directed right towards br br one thing i didn't like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york and <UNK> <UNK> mother was just an adult version of her it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do marry a man not of her social class br br as a prequel this is fairly lame but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series
<START> corny i love it corny just as the tv show was about 40 years ago adam and burt <UNK> the same on screen chemistry that never seems to have left they re live old memories plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind the scenes things which are quite interesting to know 1960s tv was corny <UNK> for so many of us back then and this dvd is no exception if you are familiar with the original tv show the fight scene with the written <UNK> and <UNK> or whatever is fantastic the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away at the end frank <UNK> makes an appearance he passed away not too long after this dvd was made i believe so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt just as he did to batman robin so many years ago he didn't lose his touch thanks to julie <UNK> to re living a villain role also in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and <UNK> these memories for those of us who remember the original thanks guys
<START> i liked it but then i think i might have been <UNK> at the same time this <UNK> of <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> is an utterly <UNK> formulaic <UNK> rescued from straight to video <UNK> on its release by the sharp turn of <UNK> <UNK> playing the <UNK> of pets she finds herself caught in a love trap when <UNK> leads her to pass her best friend uma thurman off as herself when a <UNK> comes a <UNK> br br this is an interesting film in the fascinating career of ben chaplin an average british actor he gave the hollywood <UNK> a shot with this film he is <UNK> and his <UNK> in studio productions is <UNK> on the basis of it although he has appeared in substantial cameos in both the later <UNK> <UNK> films uma thurman does a <UNK> turn on <UNK> and michael <UNK> <UNK> it all together competently <UNK> phone sex though 4 10
<START> it is no surprise that writer director michael powell considered a matter of life and death his and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fantasy from 1946 to be his favourite of their films together released during the aftermath of world war 2 this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the <UNK> for a <UNK> recovering nation in need of a good <UNK> br br following a string of other patriotic war films 'the <UNK> made this one their <UNK> <UNK> and most patriotic of the lot <UNK> british for <UNK> british <UNK> shakespeare beer fair play good manners it is also <UNK> <UNK> in its <UNK> compositions technical <UNK> and a fine multi ethnic cast br br oddly <UNK> another 1946 classic it's a wonderful life <UNK> opens on a grand <UNK> with one of those jolly voice overs preaching about the earth and the heavens and what a big wonderful world we live in br br it then cuts to the inside of a british <UNK> badly hit up in flames and with the co pilot already dead it sounds <UNK> but the connection is soon made <UNK> with the events that follow br br <UNK> in at nearly 5 minutes the rapid fire exchange between british pilot peter david niven and american radio contact june kim hunter is breathtaking in its <UNK> <UNK> to dying peter nevertheless <UNK> plenty of <UNK> charm and <UNK> <UNK> and his warm <UNK> with june <UNK> with a mutual exchange of 'i love you ' br br keeping with the magic of the moment peter by <UNK> of his conductor <UNK> whose job it was to transport him to the <UNK> world ' escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach he later encounters june riding a <UNK> and instantly matches the body with the voice br br but <UNK> their error the high court want peter sent back and order the french conductor maurice <UNK> down to earth to retrieve him but peter is <UNK> to live because of june and the <UNK> mistake and <UNK> guards his corner br br <UNK> fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american <UNK> raymond massey whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british <UNK> the surreal trial which <UNK> from b w back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital <UNK> the predictable outcome br br the abstract frame filling <UNK> to heaven the american title of the film is used twice the first time in b w when it <UNK> peter and his enigmatic french guardian <UNK> crossing giant <UNK> of <UNK> potential <UNK> for the trial including abraham lincoln and <UNK> the second time the <UNK> lit colour <UNK> provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema peter and june frozen side by side their <UNK> eyes fixed forward in the frame their fate sealed br br the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns <UNK> or <UNK> it's treated with <UNK> and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love so it can keep them together br br the french conductor who can freeze time and people's bodies <UNK> many of their key moments together <UNK> peter about history and among his mischievous tricks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 100 game <UNK> book and his coffee cup br br as visually inspired as other powell <UNK> <UNK> this was the first time they combined colour with b w ¬ñ the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes and both are equally captivating br br the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn't feel like it was written or performed for the screen amusing and witty powell <UNK> writing deserves equal <UNK> with their <UNK> for colour and composition br br made in 1946 a matter of life and death is one of those films that defies it age looking fresh and inventive even in this age where cgi would <UNK> up its artificial effects probably <UNK> them of their emotional wonder br br other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable <UNK> to <UNK> dialogue so it can <UNK> the low attention <UNK> of most audiences powell weaves a spell that <UNK> <UNK> the viewer from the first frame giving him freedom to experiment with images without <UNK> the logical development of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is actually worse than most movies i've ever suffered through and i've suffered through a lot absolute nonsense it's got terrible forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out <UNK> <UNK> scenes which look more like a high school <UNK> art project than a horror movie 5 10 at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about <UNK> especially ones with <UNK> sided fake breasts <UNK> difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from killer <UNK> from outer space during a masturbation scene which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny but it isn't <UNK> fell is the <UNK> bad guy in the history of film br br absolutely give this one a miss
<START> what an utter disappointment the score of 6 1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but oh my was i disappointed the first thing that bugs me are those <UNK> stereotyped university kids yes i know teens can be childish and so on but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete <UNK> morons there was one character that i thought was alright but he she not revealing it here was killed off way before the end the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero heroine just didn't do it for me on the plus side the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks the acting was generally not very good <UNK> <UNK> stands out in a small role but it all fails with bland and <UNK> characters you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes 4 10 and thats being generous
<START> this movie was amazingly bad i don't think i've ever seen a movie where every attempt at humor failed as miserably let's see the acting was pathetic the special effects where horrible the plot non <UNK> that pretty much sums up this movie br br
<START> i tried to like this program i really did i even bought the pilot film first on vhs and later on dvd however i couldn't get into this story because its two main characters david bruce willis and <UNK> <UNK> shepherd just seemed to in love with themselves for one thing i admit was some clever dialog in the shows which was a key part of the success of the tv program and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog br br basically this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the <UNK> and <UNK> with male versus female you get lots of arguing <UNK> yelling and screaming a lot of people apparently love that sort of <UNK> but i hate it so i never got on the <UNK> <UNK> br br only <UNK> <UNK> as the hapless <UNK> <UNK> was entertaining it's too bad she had such little air time shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off
<START> i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started <UNK> it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films <UNK> gay porn don't keep your expectations high though then you will be very disappointed out of
<START> first off i knew nothing about <UNK> and <UNK> before i watched it i had no knowledge of the role playing controversy behind it or the fact that it was a made for tv movie when i looked at the cover the updated dvd one i seriously thought it would be another fantasy adventure like <UNK> with tom hank as the nerdy hero from 1980s earth entering a mythical world to save a princess from an evil <UNK> filled with monsters sounds exciting right that is what the cover suggests to you at first glance i was given this movie as a gift obviously under the same premise because my aunt knows i'm into action movies with a medieval myth theme and it has tom hanks one of my favorite actors so i popped this movie in expecting a feel good movie with tom hanks in a 80s special effects world that would be good for a laugh br br no none of this happens now before i continue i will confess i am a nerd but i have no interest in role playing games that is all this movie is about so my interest in the content is <UNK> at best and m m <UNK> <UNK> is not even a feel good role playing based movie with lovable <UNK> that uses their imagination to enter a world of <UNK> no this is an anti role playing movie that must have been made by some religious folk the same people who also think barney is the work of satan i understand satan is a <UNK> fellow but i don't think he is desperate enough for soul to <UNK> <UNK> lovers into worship him this movie is <UNK> anti <UNK> movie this is what i get from this movie it hates <UNK> and not only does it make fun of the people engaging in role playing but it makes poor tom hanks a mental patient br br tom had an excuse to talk to a <UNK> in <UNK> poor guy was alone but tom somehow made his insanity fun and you literally saw the <UNK> as a lovable character through <UNK> good acting i wish i watched that movie instead of this in this movie tom is attacked by a make believe dragon creature it looks like a poorly made <UNK> for a <UNK> team and has a split personality that is creepy at best <UNK> acting only <UNK> to make you feel bad for his character and nothing else i get that the poor guy lost his brother and is not right in the head because of it so the movie does win points for being intentionally tragic i am not one for films that exploit mental illness and the ending to <UNK> <UNK> made me feel like <UNK> p luckily i watched <UNK> <UNK> afterwards and got a good laugh before my soul was crushed any further <UNK> <UNK> surpasses <UNK> <UNK> by a lot this is not one of <UNK> better films in fact it is <UNK> most depressing movie i've ever seen him in even <UNK> private <UNK> is not this depressing i walked in hoping to watch a feel good movie and i ended up feeling the exact opposite if you want to watch a sad both emotionally and visually movie then by all means watch this if this movie is to convey a message it is this don't play <UNK> if you are <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK>
<START> if the <UNK> of getting off the boat on the boat off the bus on the bus is a way to waste time then you should go back to the hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots and in doing so leave you <UNK> and in the cinematic <UNK> that results from not really showing the realities of life the long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and <UNK> in <UNK> feeling the characters must endure frustrating yes vital indeed the <UNK> of that travel is the key to the <UNK> of this turkish family beautiful film with great acting sad but worth it
<START> up until this new season i have been a big <UNK> <UNK> fan however the new season had absolutely ruined it br br the new christian <UNK> has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new <UNK> ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light br br i am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the <UNK> between <UNK> and the <UNK> not any more br br just <UNK> it and be done with it it's not worth watching any more br br it might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be made br br bring back the old format
<START> ironically although he can do the <UNK> thomas is a complete stiff as an actor br br this film is <UNK> into my memory as one of the most side <UNK> cheesy and incompetent movies i have ever seen as such i'm actually rather fond of it br br still the only reason this gets more than one star is that thomas is great shape and it's fun to see his tiny muscular body performing various <UNK> of <UNK> skill on the oddly shaped rocks and <UNK> scattered about the east european country side including the infamous <UNK> horse shaped well cap in the middle of a village square that thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various insane villagers but let the poor guy open his mouth and try to <UNK> and any illusion that he might have a film career is immediately <UNK> to bits br br thomas at least had the excuse that he wasn't really an actor everyone else in the film actors director editor camera guys etc is at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professionals so kurt doesn't come off quite as badly as you might think br br i hope poor kurt took the money and ran if anyone ever asks him to perform in a martial arts film again i'll bet that thomas kicks the guy in the face
<START> oh dear we don't like it when our super hero love interest develops a brain do we br br something has happened to people they have lost the ability to enjoy a simple feel good love story comedy kirsten dunst is a revelation funny sexy and real i laughed out loud <UNK> at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too the cast acting and script is great i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful those who disagree please tell me where i can find some i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits
<START> <UNK> '70s horror films ya gotta love 'em in contrast to today's boring slasher flicks these k tel <UNK> actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula br br this is a b movie about the making of a b movie that went horribly wrong faith <UNK> this island earth stars as an over the hill b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that <UNK> a family in their home her boyfriend director who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude is filming on location and on a tight schedule the ken doll co star discovers a book of <UNK> <UNK> that they work into the script to add realism unfortunately realism is something they could have done without br br john carradine having long since given up looking for the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> now <UNK> out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate he goes about his daily work but always seems to run <UNK> of the director br br the horror builds slowly a dead cat here john carradine entering a grave there finally culminating in seven yes seven murders at least there's truth in advertising it's just sad that the <UNK> didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him how was poor faith to know that those darn <UNK> <UNK> would actually work face it you just can't go around <UNK> on <UNK> coat and expect him to take it lying down br br <UNK> says perform an <UNK> on the house of seven corpses
<START> <UNK> is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups it tells the story of patrick <UNK> an expert of the occult and a <UNK> fighter who is <UNK> by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird <UNK> the game is set in ireland after world war one so don't expect to find weapons like <UNK> or rocket <UNK> all the weapons in the game can be considered <UNK> but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on our hero is <UNK> so he can use both his hands at the same time he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p c level design is also cool and atmospheric mostly the game revolves around the <UNK> estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress thanks to the talent of <UNK> barker the game has an <UNK> storyline and plot something very rare for a first person <UNK> and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent but the game has two main flaws first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it <UNK> your liberty of exploration secondly the fact all the weapons are <UNK> may not appeal to most <UNK> players who are used to high tech <UNK> as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not <UNK> difficult overall <UNK> is a great game definitely one of the best <UNK> out there
<START> ok admittedly as an <UNK> woman who lives in <UNK> park i'm going to be a little biased against this film however it seemed that <UNK> <UNK> sole purpose in making this film was <UNK> bashing with our <UNK> modest <UNK> and separate <UNK> we're a pretty easy target already <UNK> never made it past the surface the result is a film with more holes than swiss cheese 1 <UNK> tells <UNK> off for loving him more than g d or their parents then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health 2 <UNK> <UNK> out at her son's <UNK> why would a <UNK> woman from <UNK> have such a strong reaction it's hard to believe that she never attended one before let's face it even <UNK> jews hold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nowadays 3 was <UNK> sleeping during his <UNK> classes he's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and <UNK> from kissing her in the street especially in the middle of the <UNK> street in <UNK> park 4 <UNK> and <UNK> had to have been married for over a year and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other a little clue arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with nor will she be <UNK> by the community if the marriage doesn't work out 5 if <UNK> really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly she did not have to go through her <UNK> brother in law there are <UNK> female doctors lawyers teachers etc <UNK> came off as more whiny than sympathetic instead of taking control of her life she sat back and waited for things to happen and then complained that she didn't like the outcome that's not standing up to one's environment that's <UNK> to stereotype frankly i think she got what she deserved

<START> i was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in england i've seen hundreds of films since but i've never forgotten this one although sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role a lot of people seem to think that he <UNK> really come into his own until his role in from here to eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in <UNK> the other role that sticks in my mind is that of william conrad i'd never see or heard of him before this film conrad plays a terrific part in this film i remember his deep and <UNK> voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character also i remember the music that both introduces conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears an excellent film and my only disappointment was that i never ever got the chance to see it again it seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth i see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when i saw it was indeed in full color i remember sinatra's blue shirt
<START> an unfunny <UNK> picture which is an <UNK> end to peter <UNK> career it is a pity this movie was ever made

<START> i'll start with what i liked br br i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everything br br i loved the <UNK> scene and the cooking scene br br but that's about it br br i get it arty cinema <UNK> but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and <UNK> from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way br br 3 stars for the songs
<START> my take on this at our local festival where people would see me so often they thought me a better source than i may actually have been began with a head shake well i can't <UNK> the plot but it's a really superb character study of an extremely scary man then slight embarrassment i ran into someone who actually knew what had gone down that is from whom <UNK> <UNK> gets his new heart it'd been my last film in a long long day halfway through the festival maybe i'd <UNK> the better a film is the more likely it <UNK> <UNK> that send me really dreaming don't know did know there was an <UNK> twist <UNK> just beyond my ken as things finished and knew it had to do with the heart hence the quietly hilarious talent search my plot loss remark had more to do with <UNK> of <UNK> connections in france his relation to the dog woman and so on stuff i'd been wide awake for denis barely <UNK> at details that might have <UNK> another director's treatment br br but i write these things too often from memory especially festival films films whose dvd i don't have at hand le <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> is one of many examples and plot <UNK> fade much more quickly than <UNK> impressions still or already <UNK> in my memory is beyond all else a character study of a sort of dark side superman a super fiend not <UNK> in genre or historical <UNK> but active and plausible relatively soft spoken driven but patient right among us the <UNK> once he <UNK> it makes him just visually i mean in image a sort of hybrid frankenstein monster mad doctor and creation all in one the actual doctors are his tools if he doesn't <UNK> and <UNK> the heart himself it's only because it's not possible he's the force always the <UNK> <UNK> everyone he touches and finally himself what else is he to suggest that he's us the first world versus the third seems too simple since he <UNK> no less on his fellow first <UNK> on all of us br br <UNK> <UNK> eye when it looks at things i know goes usually where mine would so i tend to trust her when she looks at things i don't know snow <UNK> too fast <UNK> and forest darkness i've known in small ways but the south <UNK> not at all so i made better entry into <UNK> both france and the <UNK> <UNK> of its finish than into beau <UNK> <UNK> is for me a very comfortable <UNK> film it's a sequence of places portrayed <UNK> with a <UNK> that allows us to know them whether we've seen the reality or not a single image <UNK> <UNK> his massive weight on the thin racing frame the sounds of <UNK> air and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the dark in bright sun <UNK> <UNK> me that the film would be linear a road trip a single will driven thrust br br despite <UNK> personal power he's a human failure no matter who he's with he's alone though apparently he hasn't always been his body <UNK> life twice first to need the new heart then despite it <UNK> is tragedy <UNK> is <UNK> br br i'm <UNK> <UNK> the thread of what i remember let's leave it at that
<START> alan curtis has a loud violent sounding argument with his wife <UNK> out of his apartment has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar run by andrew <UNK> in a nice villainous part for a change and returns to find his wife dead and the police led by thomas <UNK> waiting for him his attempts to prove his <UNK> that he was with that mysterious lady fall because everyone that he can think of <UNK> elisha cook claims there was never any such person he ends up with no <UNK> although his secretary who secretly loves him ellen raines believes him convicted after a trial he is awaiting his death sentence raines starts going out after the truth discovering that <UNK> has some doubts of his own she also finds an ally in a friend of curtis <UNK> tone who was apparently out of town the night of the crime will she clear curtis in time the phantom lady is based on a novel by william irish the great noir writer <UNK> <UNK> as movie fans know from other works by <UNK> <UNK> man the night has a thousand eyes rear window no man of her own one cannot assume what is true on the surface anywhere the missing wife of a salesman may not actually be <UNK> sending him messages that she arrived if he still has her jewelry the <UNK> may really be able to predict tragedy or was he plotting the murder of his old partner now an oil millionaire did a <UNK> kill the young women or is the wealthy <UNK> in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge is the young woman claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck actually an <UNK> here it is raines and <UNK> with an assist by tone trying to prove curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing and if he did see her why is nobody else able to recall seeing her the problem with the story really is <UNK> personality he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit in reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed however in defense of <UNK> collapse it also happens to other people in various films gary cooper in mr deeds goes to town gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as <UNK> and mad by douglas <UNK> and his <UNK> that he does not defend himself at first until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and <UNK> his sense of responsibility but curtis just seems to give up in normal circumstances raines <UNK> and everyone else would not care if curtis didn't br br but the film survives this weakness the slow <UNK> of lies by witnesses <UNK> by the real killer allows two set pieces for raines with <UNK> on a deserted <UNK> platform and elisha cook at a jazz session <UNK> turns out to be more <UNK> than the villain expects in double checking his <UNK> again and the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of raines and <UNK> until the <UNK> minutes of the film if it is not as great a film as double <UNK> or the <UNK> always rings twice or the <UNK> <UNK> it holds up pretty well until the moment curtis and raines are reunited at the end
<START> i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are <UNK> their remarks on the mst3k airing that's fair enough that is after all how it got its <UNK> exposure but having had the misfortune of seeing final justice in its original form i'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version br br first off it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast <UNK> primarily to an <UNK> scene between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i could use the characters' names instead of the actors' but i just love <UNK> the words <UNK> <UNK> explaining why <UNK> fugitive character can't just leave <UNK> right away it's not a very convincing plot point but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for <UNK> i don't know br br another plot point missing in the original the <UNK> betrayal of <UNK> <UNK> to joe don baker seemingly <UNK> in the mst3k version is explained by an earlier extremely unpleasant scene in which <UNK> rapes her in the shower while this does give her a motive for turning against him the whole scenario is just really <UNK> there's no other word for it br br some of the <UNK> worthy moments the <UNK> <UNK> shouts of son of a and the <UNK> <UNK> shooting of the sheriff were purely the result of the edited for tv print they worked with and were absent from the original movie br br one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version before entering the bar to question some people joe don asks the <UNK> <UNK> accompanying him to stay outside because they see that uniform they won't <UNK> however joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy slash sheriff outfit complete with shiny <UNK> i can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him br br one final observation on the original uncut version of final justice why oh why did they feel the need to put <UNK> <UNK> naked butt up on the screen
<START> this is a movie that plays to everyone's emotions we all want a second chance at things jim morris got one followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream what a great message and what a great delivery by this movie
<START> my name is heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on i want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were it didn't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had i truly appreciate them br br hi everyone br br this is <UNK> mom it's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago for any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation please know that there are people out here in <UNK> that do understand completely how you feel our thoughts and <UNK> are with each and every one of you
<START> what begins as a fairly clever farce about a somewhat shady security <UNK> company turns almost <UNK> into an uninteresting and completely inane murder mystery david arquette and the great stanley <UNK> try <UNK> to make this train wreck watchable but some things are just not <UNK> possible br br what for instance causes <UNK> to turn suddenly from a sweet <UNK> figure into a drunken <UNK> at <UNK> parents house why would <UNK> although admittedly a <UNK> want to destroy the business to which he <UNK> his life by robbing and possibly murdering his customers why does the seemingly sensible tommy believe that <UNK> could be a murderer based almost entirely on a dream and even if that were believable why wouldn't he go to the police and why didn't <UNK> <UNK> the alarm when she got home especially after <UNK> <UNK> about it being off of course all of these events are necessary for the plot and i use the term very very loosely to unfold and it might be forgivable if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy but everything from <UNK> description of his date rape to the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> to the final joke about <UNK> and <UNK> still being dead is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else br br i checked the box <UNK> that my comments contained spoilers but there's nothing more i or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven
<START> i first saw this movie in my plays <UNK> course at <UNK> i was <UNK> at how beautiful and raw this documentary was it is a sincere look into the <UNK> reality of a life of <UNK> the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core as a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming little edie became <UNK> with one of the camera men the beauty i find comes from the <UNK> of the family's <UNK> it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little <UNK> <UNK> to society in all the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it's portrayal of surprising beauty two thumbs way up
<START> the problem is the role of the characters in the film man to man shows a british <UNK> kidnapping two <UNK> and taking them to scotland and then <UNK> that they are not animals or <UNK> but actually equal to himself the problem is the role of the <UNK> in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such a shallow stereotypical role within the film the <UNK> british <UNK> ends up being the hero of the film because he <UNK> to relate to the <UNK> no notion of how the two <UNK> feel of their point of view of their ordeal i find it is a shallow film with a one sided <UNK> racist view it never manages to move away from the <UNK> <UNK> view
<START> i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers sure it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic lesbian vampires <UNK> morris and <UNK> d play these two lovely <UNK> with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way <UNK> to their home at <UNK> and invite their prey sex <UNK> men to their <UNK> what happens there well after they <UNK> and kiss each other mostly they kill their <UNK> director jose <UNK> <UNK> does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot but sex alone does not hold a film up no pun intended at least <UNK> there really isn't much of a story here we have the two girls we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol why what does it mean why do we have the guy that stays for several days <UNK> a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago does that have a purpose of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine <UNK> filled with wine from the <UNK> anyway the script is <UNK> with such flaws it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims wine and <UNK> them quite literally and then go to bed in the crypt the end gets going with some <UNK> scenes but it is anti climatic there are as i said some effective scenes by the director i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey the house is also a most impressive set and both girls are as i said very lovely <UNK> morris in particular stands out in more ways than one for you older film fans silent screen veteran <UNK> love has a brief cameo at film's end
<START> wow only a movie this <UNK> awful could inspire the similar <UNK> i mean where to begin the <UNK> horrid theme song pia <UNK> non expressions throughout the movie the fact that despite being set in los angeles aka land of the casting couch every single man and woman is <UNK> all over themselves to sleep with pia <UNK> by any contrived means necessary or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind numbingly stupid pia or obvious despicable <UNK> everyone else and given that this flick was written by actual screenwriters sorta it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie making industry who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter br br but it's unintentionally funny as hell though the breakdown scene alone will have you <UNK> and after seeing the climatic i'm not the only one who had to her way to the top scene at the awards all done in the usual bargain basement acting level we expect from such quality <UNK> as pia i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually <UNK> that speech when she won her golden globe it's fitting and that would totally make my day br br anyway if you're a fan of bad <UNK> camp give this otherwise tacky movie a try
<START> i saw this film when it first came out in 1978 when i was a <UNK> in high school i took a date to see it i didn't get any needless to say because the film was so bad joan <UNK> career never <UNK> as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap in fact unfunny isn't a severe enough term this film is anti funny you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isn't worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being so bad it's good not even the gang at mst3k could've made this worth watching the fact that billy <UNK> career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle
<START> michael jackson is not very popular in usa anymore however in europe especially germany he has still got lots of fans many will say that this is a bad movie and it is it has no plot it's full of cliches michael <UNK> himself constantly br br but you can't expect a plot or non cliches in this kind of movie it has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect the smooth criminal <UNK> the greatest song ever full of <UNK> group dance acts and even the famous michael jackson's <UNK> over makes this film one of jackson's masterpieces with an even good looking and white michael jackson br br a must for jackson fans a must for music fans a must for dance act fans br br however as i'm an <UNK> fan i should warn all michael jackson <UNK> out there don't watch this movie you'd only make your hate increase
<START> lame plot and two dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut outs needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fianc√© he looked and acted more like a cartoon in summary i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama it uses just about every clich√© in the book the tortured classical musician who wants to break out and play <UNK> the free spirited fianc√©e engaged to a bean counter personality she doesn't love i won't list them or else it would be a spoiler because i'd be giving away the whole plot the dancing was ok but nothing special i've seen worse 3 stars for good music the band was really tight i saw it on youtube thankfully i didn't pay good money to see it at a theater i'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has <UNK>
<START> i missed almost all of the first season but when the other shows went to reruns i started watching i ended up buying the entire first season off <UNK> this is now one of my favorite comedy shows patrick <UNK> is the key his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time david spade is funny but sometimes a little russell goes a long way i enjoy the other cast members more but not saying he doesn't add to the show br br do yourself a favor if you haven't checked this one out give it a try if you can catch the episode where jeff goes to the <UNK> bank you will see how good this show is br br i hope this series has a long run
<START> one wonders how the script came to be written br br wayne and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing br br one feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that <UNK> no one br br nonetheless it has historical value
<START> the long list of big names in this flick including the <UNK> john mills didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble air ace hero to the loud mouthed <UNK> <UNK> the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising <UNK> grand <UNK> and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline <UNK> writing but <UNK> pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons pre nose job with a rousing little <UNK> i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it <UNK> <UNK> and minor
<START> aka blood castle or scream of the demon br br spoiler br br this was a drive in feature co billed with the <UNK> vampire a spanish italian co production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named <UNK> <UNK> is seen on <UNK> riding off with his <UNK> <UNK> dog behind him br br the <UNK> already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down the murders first began around the time count <UNK> older brother count <UNK> <UNK> was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident br br then a woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up <UNK> agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the <UNK> for the <UNK> of dead cells <UNK> wants to bring <UNK> <UNK> corpse back to life br br but of course <UNK> is still alive although horribly burned and stalking and killing the women in the village we see his <UNK> <UNK> face appear at various points in the film so we know he's still alive making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious br br <UNK> meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with <UNK> over <UNK> with the burning <UNK> falling on to the same bed that <UNK> stumbles on to meeting yet another final <UNK> <UNK> end br br the <UNK> dvd is taken from a vhs source and looks quite grainy and bad other than an even <UNK> trailer no other extras are included although it has a nice creepy spanish castle and good <UNK> i found it to be fairly boring and predictable with no excitement or mystery whatsoever br br 3 out of 10
<START> this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard to find gem it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like <UNK> and beyond the darkness unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this movie br br zombi 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci zombie franchise which began in 1979 similarly compared to zombie zombi 3 consists of a <UNK> plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this <UNK> trash barely <UNK> the gore is nearly non existent unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing br br the plot this time around involves some sort of <UNK> military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ie an idiotic male and his stupid female side kick who are developing some sort of chemical called death one that is supposed to re <UNK> the dead unless my ears need to be checked i don't even recall a reason for the research of death one it seems to exist only to <UNK> havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to <UNK> in this cinematic laugh fest br br anyway death one is <UNK> on a corpse whom i swear looked like <UNK> <UNK> and after it is <UNK> into his system he sits <UNK> and his head explodes the sound effects are also quite hilarious as the <UNK> face <UNK> with green <UNK> the sound of <UNK> <UNK> can be heard the death one <UNK> is transported outside and is <UNK> <UNK> by a group of thieves where one makes off with it but <UNK> himself after cutting himself on an exposed <UNK> br br needless to say the guy turns into a zombie but not before he makes his <UNK> escape to a cheap motel <UNK> a <UNK> porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before <UNK> everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the <UNK> <UNK> and turn the motel upside down they find the infected thief and burn his body only to have the smoke <UNK> a flock of birds that are flying over the <UNK> stack br br we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army listening to <UNK> <UNK> that is coming out of a little <UNK> boom box while <UNK> a trailer load of <UNK> girls who are <UNK> out of the windows and showing off their <UNK> can someone say zombie food we also have a sub plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to <UNK> a group of birds lying on the road the same birds that were infected by the <UNK> smoke br br the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie she walks around this old dirty rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask <UNK> hello is there anyone here please i just need some water she encounters a group of zombies one of which is <UNK> to a wall and the other is swinging a <UNK> after a bit of <UNK> and <UNK> around on the ground she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter br br meanwhile the birds attack the trailer load of <UNK> and one girl gets <UNK> and infected they all pull up to the same motel where the original <UNK> took place and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place after a matter of hours a day at the most the same motel is now <UNK> in dust has <UNK> growing throughout it and looks like it has been sitting <UNK> for years anyway what better place to take <UNK> than this particular building needless to say the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack br br the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village of which the woman comments this place is a dump she then proceeds to get <UNK> off a balcony by a zombie into <UNK> <UNK> water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds meanwhile her friend back at the motel who got <UNK> and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie br br unfortunately there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words for example the time rate concerning infected people being <UNK> <UNK> greatly sometimes it takes seconds other times it takes hours some zombies run others drag their feet and walk really slow some even do kung fu moves while others hide under <UNK> of <UNK> to surprise people some of the zombies even talk the funniest moment of course is the infamous <UNK> head in the <UNK> gag which <UNK> itself in mid air and <UNK> a stupid man who goes looking for food <UNK> enough his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it's <UNK> counter part <UNK> br br the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies we never get to see them come back as zombies in fact the only ones we do see <UNK> are the ones <UNK> by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off other than that i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies it is also amazing that these zombies only take a <UNK> <UNK> and then move on to their next victim br br the most laughable moment was of course the zombie <UNK> a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital a woman who seems to have a lot of <UNK> <UNK> tries to deliver the baby and has her face pulled off by a zombie before having her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off timeless br br as usual all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre the <UNK> military officer the pathetic useless <UNK> women who scream to get killed the obvious characters who are about to get killed ie watch for the man chasing a chicken i guess this movie really is a comedy there were many laughable scenes such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand <UNK> obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent and a climatic scene where a man screams i'm <UNK> <UNK> for your blood the costumes are really bad the same zombies <UNK> throughout the course of the film wearing the same <UNK> <UNK> clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film and watch out for the blue 60's <UNK> the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend <UNK> into the infected man br br the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story line a radio dj who <UNK> throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his <UNK> about the <UNK> of the <UNK> while the two survivors take off in a helicopter hardly dawn of the dead material if you ask me br br regardless this movie does deliver many laughs the gore is minimal and what gore there is it is very unconvincing let alone unimaginative the usual mix of black blood thick green goo <UNK> out of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> make <UNK> <UNK> of green moss zombi 3 makes for a good rental for a sleep over party or a night of beer and popcorn other than that horror fans should stay away br br 3 out of 10
<START> certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form featuring a <UNK> <UNK> performance by rain joan of arc phoenix <UNK> sister inevitably as bonanza <UNK> plus <UNK> awful <UNK> narration by tom robbins the author of the novel which had <UNK> its peculiar sweet <UNK> charms
<START> actually this movie has silly moments both in the <UNK> part and in the joe <UNK> and children part and it's much worse than other <UNK> movies like the <UNK> captain <UNK> and ghosts but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years yeah that's half my life you guys i can't complain too much about it just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me but as a movie it's not good at all and i'm afraid that it would get a much lower grade for me if my darling mike hadn't been the one starring in it but since no one but mike is the <UNK> it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me
<START> <UNK> mister tom begins in an <UNK> exquisite village in the south of england where the sun always seems to shine before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio <UNK> of the <UNK> of world war ii soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings <UNK> children from london and when shy little william is <UNK> with reluctant gruff old tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br and what a load of sentimental <UNK> it is in fact it's just the old odd couple buddy formula aren't any new stories being written br br as i suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in london apart from the odd old <UNK> <UNK> around and certainly no hint of the horror of the <UNK> as <UNK> citizens file <UNK> into air raid <UNK> even when the local <UNK> husband is <UNK> missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br i found <UNK> mister <UNK> cliched and obvious and john <UNK> accent <UNK> up a picture of <UNK> barker of the two <UNK> with a straw in his mouth doing his country <UNK> accent br br incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that i disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers i seem to be in a minority of one br br
<START> saw in on tv late last night yeah i can hear what <UNK> say about this one it is likely to be <UNK> as one of those <UNK> typical tv soap series in all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying well that's not what i expected but as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no there's nothing to <UNK> rated r oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again
<START> i used this film in a religion class i was teaching the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment a young boy and his mother are away from home the boy has been given money to buy milk on the way home he stops at carnival to play a game next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary the boy drops the bottle of milk it breaks the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk this scene <UNK> with what is happening at home a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment he discovers the fish bowl and watches it the fish <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> out of the bowl by now a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath the cat drops the fish into the bowl the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat both inspire prejudice both are innocent it was a great discussion <UNK> in my class
<START> on second viewing of this movie i like it even more than the first time it is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often <UNK> but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little <UNK> in our lives to which we normally only offer the <UNK> of attention <UNK> here the movie <UNK> into the celebration of these <UNK> the meeting of a <UNK> truck driver and client the <UNK> hearing a <UNK> cry from the <UNK> the dialogue acting casting and direction are superb no two by <UNK> no grand revelations what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic <UNK> and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated kudos to all involved in this we need more grand <UNK> in our lives 9 out of 10
<START> although i've long been a fan of peter <UNK> i hadn't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave and it was a pleasant unpredictable surprise br br richard chamberlain plays david a lawyer invited to defend five <UNK> charged with murdering another <UNK> for david's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should <UNK> guilty and serve a quick sentence but david believes there's a mystery underneath the murder linked to <UNK> <UNK> as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his <UNK> but about himself too br br to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting br br there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie <UNK> acting for instance but also the performances by david <UNK> who plays a young <UNK> who introduces david into <UNK> mysteries and <UNK> <UNK> who plays an old <UNK> who's a spiritual guide the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie br br but there's also the way <UNK> suggests the supernatural in the movie david has dreams that warn him of the future australia is <UNK> awful weather with <UNK> <UNK> falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than <UNK> but it's also related to the case david is defending how it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie out of little events <UNK> manages to create an atmosphere of dread and <UNK> suggesting future horrors without really showing anything br br charles <UNK> score is fantastic especially the use of the <UNK> the photography is also quite good russell <UNK> <UNK> longtime <UNK> who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander depicts a dark creepy world full of mystery br br i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on <UNK> it doesn't turn into an <UNK> against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions like dances with wolves or the last samurai this movie is too clever to be that simplistic br br sometimes it can be frustrating and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense but for those who don't mind some <UNK> or ambiguity the last wave is a great movie to watch
<START> after <UNK> the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers there are the ones who are well read extremely <UNK> and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author for many years science fiction <UNK> in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre <UNK> teenagers today's well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and <UNK> the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it's own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye as they should as hollywood's record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the <UNK> br br the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well i haven't read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely <UNK> willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of <UNK> bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point i robot while supposedly based on <UNK> short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what <UNK> wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy i robot will be very much surprised this movie isn't even based on that story at all br br the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of <UNK> i won't point them out i won't <UNK> feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of <UNK> characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their <UNK> is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of <UNK> in anything about this movie there will always be those <UNK> i e <UNK> who will state the movie doesn't have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why <UNK> a great body of work by <UNK> it's title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and don't buy the rights to the works title it something else don't use the character's names believe me no one will <UNK> you of <UNK> in fact it won't matter what you title it to the <UNK> <UNK> who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show br br i robot like much of hollywood's take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an <UNK> mindless audience that will accept <UNK> <UNK> like this
<START> this movie started out with some semblance of a plot then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward it was impossible to remain engaged with this film this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio clearly there are <UNK> and motivation problems at disney not to mention a complete lack of <UNK> and quality control that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation this movie joins my very short worst movies of all time list
<START> creature <UNK> in america should have been released on a different network or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes unfortunately this was not the case given that american audiences seemingly have the attention <UNK> of a <UNK> when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced <UNK> or has a <UNK> with <UNK> functions both sound and <UNK> shows like this will be few and far between one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was it was made for a <UNK> audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching which is sad but not unexpected i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface but thanks to political correctness such conversations take place only in my mind
<START> a family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order people die and so will you if you try to sit through this if you've ever had any desire to see bad actors many with ill fitting <UNK> act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance this is just awful its so bad i thought al <UNK> one of the worst directors ever directed it but i was wrong br br its so bad i don't want to say anything more about it not because it isn't polite but because once i start i may not be able to stop br br avoid
<START> i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't wait br br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre <UNK> back because the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> was always the strongest part of an all together great show
<START> possibly very minor spoilers br br this movie is billed as the first russian horror movie unfortunately as far as i am concerned the witch its russian title will take a place of <UNK> in the gallery of horrible russian movies it is based on <UNK> <UNK> story <UNK> which is a classic in russia based is the key word here since no <UNK> with the story is required instead the less you know about <UNK> the better br br it is a unique production because we are quite used to directors taking stories from other cultures and adapting them to their own culture the <UNK> of american remakes of foreign films is a prime example but then again <UNK> turned <UNK> seven samurai into the magnificent seven with splendid results and kurosawa transferred shakespeare's <UNK> into japan to make an incredibly powerful throne in blood while king <UNK> became a riveting ran however with the witch we have russians <UNK> a russian classical tale onto the american <UNK> the movie was shot in <UNK> in english with the aim of dubbing it into english using american actors and have reasonably <UNK> lip movements br br as a natural consequence lost is the colorful <UNK> background for the story in comes a drab american small town seemingly lifted from some outdated horror book <UNK> gone is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead we have a <UNK> journalist who is about to win <UNK> prize and who at the same time writes about x files like events and <UNK> miss boobs <UNK> i never thought <UNK> prize was given for that kind of writing now i <UNK> stand <UNK> in a strange nod to <UNK> the journalist is named <UNK> <UNK> they should've named him john smith because it is impossible to get more hackneyed clich√©d and generic than this movie br br <UNK> goes to a town named <UNK> gets stranded on a dirt road <UNK> on until he finds a <UNK> house and is rather un welcomed by an old <UNK> all that to the <UNK> of a radio <UNK> about the forces of evil being at their most powerful and people better staying <UNK> and avoiding water need i mention that it's <UNK> really hard after a few supposedly frightening scenes which had me laughing the story finds our journalist dressed as a priest he's mistaken for a priest and the local sheriff tells him his daughter who died after being brutally attacked wanted the new priest to pray for her for three nights at this point the action supposedly starts those who have time to kill are welcome to it br br what is wrong with this film everything starting with the dialog and down to the prop department the dialog which i heard in russian was clearly originally written in english and it was <UNK> exclusively from clich√©s and <UNK> picked from american films the actors just as clearly <UNK> with english because the timing of their speech was <UNK> and unnatural and the russian dubbing followed suit the acting is mostly atrocious and not only because the actors find it often difficult to talk but because they don't have anything approaching a range of facial expressions for the most part they're just blank or you wish they were the only exceptions being the sheriff played by <UNK> <UNK> a fine <UNK> actor and <UNK> <UNK> who plays a wheelchair bound resident of <UNK> oh and a <UNK> of course who's absolutely natural on camera i know actors complain of being <UNK> by dogs and cats but when <UNK> is <UNK> by a <UNK> it is a sad <UNK> to the general quality of acting in the film br br there wasn't a single scary moment in the entire film and there wasn't a single original moment in the film either mind you this <UNK> coming from somebody who's rather inexperienced with horror the film is filled with standard moves used in horror movie since the <UNK> <UNK> at a critical moment the camera <UNK> lovingly on a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> promptly goes out it must have seen a few horror movies too an example of supreme idiocy comes at another moment a character jumps out of a <UNK> and runs at the camera he's wearing something the looks like <UNK> it doesn't get any more idiotic than this br br those in russia who liked it claim it should've been advertised as a mystical thriller i wasn't thrilled either it was run of the mill from start to finish i particularly enjoyed the fact that the entire population of the little town <UNK> as if they knew exactly they lived in a horror movie except they weren't quite sure whether it had zombies or not therefore some of them acted zombie like just in case br br the makers of the film say it's about finding faith such a fine <UNK> of idiotic actions <UNK> contrived moments and yes clich√©s doesn't deserve to be about finding faith the movie is so thoroughly and utterly fake it deserves only to be an exhibit in a wax figure museum
<START> now please don't start calling me names like <UNK> weirdo and more br br the very length of this movie 4 hours is its biggest mistake no editing at all seems like j p <UNK> fell in love with his project too much even <UNK> was 4 hours long but it was entertaining and gave a message as well br br it's based on true incidents and real people kudos to it but were the repetitive war scenes really needed on top of it the focus constantly <UNK> from one <UNK> <UNK> to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all br br between the <UNK> there were songs about loneliness <UNK> and related stuff there were <UNK> conversations in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the <UNK> talk br br why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near and when they were shot it <UNK> sympathy but it seemed <UNK> of them to be so <UNK> of their safety in the first place br br music was <UNK> and the lyrics were <UNK> but did not fit with the movie better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie br br acting was the saving grace from seasoned veterans like <UNK> <UNK> and ajay <UNK> to relative <UNK> like <UNK> bachchan and <UNK> <UNK> everyone acted like a pro <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> deserve a special mention for <UNK> up the mood whenever necessary br br dialogues <UNK> from brilliant from <UNK> with love to illogical monotonous <UNK> se <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> spree <UNK> of all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and f words wasn't really required br br <UNK> <UNK> attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave indian soldiers but tries too hard and ultimately fails indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute
<START> just saw this tonight at a <UNK> on digital projection shot on <UNK> and first feature film fully <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and projected with <UNK> <UNK> at etc <UNK> theater in <UNK> so much for tech stuff 18 directors including alexander payne wes <UNK> joel and ethan <UNK> gus van <UNK> walter <UNK> and gerard depardieu among several good french international directors were each given 5 minutes to make a love story they come in all <UNK> and forms with known actors <UNK> wood natalie portman steve <UNK> totally hilarious maggie <UNK> nick nolte <UNK> rowlands <UNK> good and she actually wrote the piece she was in <UNK> depardieu and many good international actors as well the stories <UNK> from all out romance to quirky comedy to alex <UNK> touching study of a woman discovering herself to van <UNK> and one of those things that happens anywhere maybe nothing really off putting by having french spoken in most sequences with english subtitles and a small amount of actual english spoken though that will probably <UNK> it to art houses a la <UNK> also only one piece that might be considered experimental but colorful and funny as well the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships all easy to follow unless the experimental one <UNK> your desire for a formulaic story several brought up some emotions for me i admit i am affected by love in cinema when it is presented in something other than sentimentality i even laughed at a <UNK> piece like no other i have seen thank you for that the film hit its peak for me somewhere around a little more than half way through then the last two sequences picked up again some beautiful shots of paris at night lush romantic kind of music usually used to good effect not just <UNK> for emotions in sound generally good cinematography though some shots seemed soft focus when it couldn't have meant to have been main character in shot scene pacing of each film was good and overall structure though a bit long they left out two of what was to be 20 films but said all would be on the dvd seemed to <UNK> between tones of the films to keep a good balance not sure when it comes out but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work and sometimes what doesn't work if it covers too much time emotionally for a short film should be in region one when released but they didn't know when
<START> completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphic depiction of the <UNK> affair with the beast a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women that's pretty much what he does and the film's depiction of the beast is really really awful it's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge <UNK> tube for a hard on that <UNK> <UNK> amounts of white <UNK> for fans of fake animal porn i guess maybe this is a real turn on i was amused however by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square
<START> when i saw the commercial for this i was all about seeing it now forgive me but it's been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went suffice it to say the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the movie they sold me on br br i was bored annoyed and incredibly disappointed by this movie and if it wasn't bad enough they had to sink it even further with that awful <UNK> music not exactly mood setting music for a horror movie eh <UNK> i guess if you never saw the commercial or trailer i suppose you may think this is some hot stuff for my money the commercial was way better
<START> firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it i find it the most annoying program on tv there is nothing funny about any of the <UNK> and the <UNK> laughter is unbearable the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience that way the laughter would show just how <UNK> the show is however i give credit to the acting talents of the young cast it <UNK> me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was the show <UNK> in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the <UNK> <UNK> why the youth of today need to be <UNK> at so much is beyond me that is all
<START> this is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice over that <UNK> fun at everything french and then produces a rather <UNK> but very brave hero in <UNK> la <UNK> portrayed by the splendid gerard <UNK> the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> notably that he will marry king louis <UNK> daughter problem is la <UNK> soon find outs she too is in love with <UNK> br br <UNK> by good sword fights <UNK> and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a <UNK> pace and with many comic moments the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un seriously that i could not give those shortcomings a second thought look out for <UNK> <UNK> a traditional heavy in french films trying to steal la <UNK> making himself a <UNK> and feeding the script to the fortune <UNK> that reads la <UNK> hand and what a gem marcel <UNK> is as the <UNK> and lust driven king louis <UNK> that is not all so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish i were in france and on the set back in <UNK> the film may have come out that year but its <UNK> cheek superb narration <UNK> photography and the memorable gerard <UNK> ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch i would not hesitate to recommend it to my <UNK> let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and <UNK> in particular do see it
<START> indian summer it was very nostalgic for me i found it funny heartwarming and absolutely loved it anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the good <UNK> days for a brief time really needs to see this one it starts out as 20 years later a group of old <UNK> returns for a reunion i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself the actors were great and it contains an all star cast everyone in it played a terrific role you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives this is also a good family movie for the most part i would suggest this one to anybody in a <UNK> highly recommended
<START> the silent film the pride of the clan starring mary pickford was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of scotland in <UNK> most of the exterior shots were filmed in <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> neck near several rocky <UNK> <UNK> areas including the <UNK> and castle rock my initial interest in the film was because of two factors 1 the <UNK> film location in my hometown and 2 the fact that my grandmother <UNK> m <UNK> was hired as a stand in for mary pickford during filming of several scenes including the cliff scene both women were small <UNK> in stature and both my father and grandmother related the fact that she was a stand in with her back to the camera for the cliff scene as part of the <UNK> filming set i just wanted to relate this story for future film historians and buffs the film itself my dvd copy is somewhat poor is very well done with lots of action and <UNK> acting including several scenes where miss pickford portrays a strong woman characterization i enjoyed it and would love to get a better copy of it although i am unsure whether one exists as i have seen in various movie sites that remaining copies are dark because of <UNK> a very nice film of the silent genre with lots of action
<START> i saw this at the premiere in melbourne br br it is shallow two dimensional <UNK> and hard to believe given the subject matter boring the actors are passable but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be over <UNK> you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards however it doesn't work as a popcorn film either its pacing is too off <UNK> and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane <UNK> br br i very much doubt <UNK> jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best i could have done with the material br br ned kelly is a fascinating figure and equally so is the national response to him possibly folk genius possibly class warrior possibly psychopath and probably all these things he has dominated australian true mythology for over <UNK> years once again his story has failed miserably on the big screen br br such is life
<START> in 1988 paperhouse was <UNK> as a thinking man's horror film wow you might say sign me up this thing is a mess it features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2 g <UNK> with a bad british dubbed accent and a story with no chills thrills or <UNK> br br it isn't even interesting psycho <UNK> one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of <UNK> 5 br br the story involves a girl with <UNK> fever who escapes in her dreams what you get isn't good horror art house or even a decent after school special i found myself after the two hour point saying where did my two hours go br br the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious something interesting it seems like the producers were on <UNK> br br even in the dream world things are boring br br a short no on this one
<START> jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best westerns ever made and this is one of the best br br the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian <UNK> that serve as a backdrop for the story some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film br br in all five of the westerns that stewart and mann did together the supporting roles were perfectly cast no exception here right down to parts that might only have a few lines the characters are firmly <UNK> with those lines br br stewart is a cynical hard bitten loner in this film whose only real friend is his sidekick walter brennan it's <UNK> death at the hands of the villains that makes him want to finally free the gold <UNK> from the bad guys and incidentally redeem himself in the process br br john mcintire is the head villain of the piece and he was an under appreciated actor with a vast range he could play delightful old <UNK> authority figures and in this case a particularly nasty and <UNK> villain br br one of the best westerns ever
<START> that was definitely the case with angels in the <UNK> it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn't seen the film since my <UNK> year in high school and i'm now in my 4th year of college although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself it is also hilarious danny <UNK> <UNK> is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film and i'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best a must see i highly recommend br br 8 10
<START> if you like adult comedy cartoons like south park then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have given exploding <UNK> and <UNK> like <UNK> i think <UNK> is a good leader there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school there's the idiotic principal mr <UNK> the nervous <UNK> teacher and many others the cast is also fantastic <UNK> <UNK> gina <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tracy ann <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dead <UNK> mark perry and <UNK> nina <UNK> i didn't know this came from canada but it is very good very good
<START> after reading through many of the reviews i don't know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasn't the same one i saw br br this movie is horrible the acting primarily moore's is just terrible the woman cannot act nice tits but she just can't act at no point did she come across as the actual character instead it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make believe with the boys br br and that's what this movie ultimately is hollywood make believe the training sequences are over the top the politics over the top the political correctness over the top the combat scenes you guessed it over the top your mission is to get in and get out without being <UNK> so what do you do why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course oh g i jane you can be my wing man anytime br br the premise is good but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with top gun with tits br br what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore not much i guess
<START> there is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by cary grant <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> those expectations are <UNK> further when the film is directed by stanley <UNK> whose comic touch was so evident in among others damn <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for the first five minutes or so it seems that those expectations might be met and <UNK> nothing what is supposed to be a light comedy <UNK> into <UNK> heavy handed melodrama with <UNK> a chuckle to be had br br relative newcomer <UNK> parker has often been criticized for her performance or lack of one in this film but in a movie in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden attacking parker seems unfair not even as bright a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the <UNK> of this meandering dreary and wholly pointless script which drags itself <UNK> along and drags the viewer's interest and patience down with it br br the rest of the cast especially ray <UNK> keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings but the horrible script is beyond <UNK> the desperate inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the <UNK> audience in the film's final moments only serves to add insult to injury br br this film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels
<START> and how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic <UNK> uber new <UNK> persona in this film woody is played by will ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct <UNK> than the one kenneth branagh did in celebrity it's an annoyingly repetitive story now <UNK> neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls <UNK> in love with a <UNK> queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great manhattan <UNK> everyone constantly <UNK> expensive <UNK> <UNK> during which all the characters relate fascinating <UNK> and discuss <UNK> philosophy there is always a trip to the <UNK> during which the <UNK> main character <UNK> out about sand and physical <UNK> and possible exposure to <UNK> and then of course said main character feels guilty about his lust for the <UNK> queen but <UNK> her anyway sometimes <UNK> sometimes failing etc br br this a tired formula and proof that allen isn't really a great film artist at all he just seems like a dirty old man with the <UNK> and emotions of a 20 year old who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again
<START> basically take the concept of every asian horror ghost movie and smash it into one and you get this movie the story goes like this a bunch of college kids get voice <UNK> from their own phones that are <UNK> their deaths there's some s going on with ghosts which if you've seen any asian ghost movie isn't scary by now this movie was quite <UNK> because it's very clich√©d it's the same <UNK> different movie br br the acting was pretty good unfortunately the actors are put into a very ring esquire situation so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past the two lead acts did a solid job though br br as far as gore there's not much going on we get a cool sequence that includes an arm <UNK> a head off i don't know how else to explain that but it was cut away so you don't see anything except the final result you see some blood at times including decapitated arms and a zombie that looked really cool i might add but this movie isn't too bloody br br the scares in the movie are few and spread out and it's really not that scary you'll get some creepy images at times but it's not enough for me to consider scary it's nothing different from <UNK> <UNK> on or dark water and none of those scared me either that's really the downfall of this and most asian horror movies is that if it doesn't deliver the scares then it's just not that good br br as far as directing takashi miike still did a pretty good job he seemed a little <UNK> in this movie compared to his past movies but he still portrays a lot of his messed up style he's become famous for a lot of images were a lot like miike including a scene with a bunch of <UNK> of dead <UNK> and the last 15 20 minutes seemed far more miike then the rest of the movie still the movie is flawed by its <UNK> br br i would recommend this only to people who are huge on asian horror movies even if you are i can recommend much better or big miike fans warning to those who want to get into miike this is not his best work br br i'm giving it a 4 because it's just mediocre perhaps if this was released 4 or 5 years ago it might be worth a higher rating br br also i'd like to b about asian horror movies real quick how come if it's an asian horror movie it's automatically suppose to be good over here us a lot of these movies are the equivalent in japan to what scream urban legends and i know what you did last summer were over here in the 90's if you've seen one you've seen them all and a lot of these movies rely way too much on scares and imagery that if it doesn't deliver the scares they set out to do then they're just not that good and nothing would change that more asian horror films need to be more like audition and a tale of two sisters two movies that if they don't <UNK> or scare you at least they have great stories acting direction cinematography and much more to back them up two movies that aren't just great horror movies but great movies in general more asian horror movies need to be like these instead of the clich√© a ghost just wanted to be found so it went around killing people through their phone video tape house electric <UNK> water <UNK> <UNK> search engine <UNK> <UNK> etc
<START> it's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did adam sandler practically drags you in with his <UNK> and often violent <UNK> but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isn't pulling him down i'm not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes <UNK> and lip <UNK> even the most macho of men would have to be heartless <UNK> to not feel something while watching this movie don cheadle gives another great performance but is out <UNK> by sandler <UNK> tyler and <UNK> <UNK> smith give solid performances but nothing in the line of the two leading roles <UNK> humor is still present which actually saved this film from being border line depressing there are several laughs to be had but don't think you will stay there long because it gets serious again without much warning br br i could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains but i will cut this one short i feel there is no need to tell you anything more do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie even if you have to wait until it comes out on dvd it's 100 worth the time a deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face unless of course you are a heartless soul
<START> i saw this back in <UNK> when it was finally released apparently because <UNK> pictures was in <UNK> i think the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier br br i have problem remembering details partly because i haven't seen it in a long time but i do remember it as a very dull movie i kept <UNK> whether to walk out of it the store was not at all interesting or engaging was a 3rd rate america <UNK> imitation br br none of the performances make it worth watching either one of the biggest <UNK> since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating
<START> years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it it's a marvelous spoof of <UNK> with <UNK> the usual actors' <UNK> and all sorts of lovely <UNK> but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but it's marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i'll throw it on while doing <UNK> and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many <UNK> to all who made it
<START> this was director von <UNK> third effort it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing <UNK> he would display a few years later with his <UNK> greed and the wedding march essentially we have a trio of <UNK> <UNK> as a russian count and two russian <UNK> who have rented a villa in <UNK> <UNK> their aim is to use <UNK> money at the gambling tables and win a fortune part of that plan is for the count von <UNK> to <UNK> himself between a visiting american <UNK> and his foolish wife <UNK> her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses he makes the mistake of also taking the life <UNK> of the maid whom he has promised to marry when she sees them together she sets fire to the room von <UNK> and his prey are on the <UNK> balcony here von <UNK> first <UNK> his persona as the man you love to hate he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director there is a cute bit when he first attempts to meet the <UNK> wife she is reading a book we see the title foolish wives by <UNK> von <UNK> this was originally <UNK> as a <UNK> minute film cut down to <UNK> minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes the <UNK> on <UNK> video <UNK> surviving footage damaged in some way in most scenes from the alternate earlier version to give us a <UNK> minute print
<START> i remember seeing this in a the <UNK> movie theater where i used to attend kiddie <UNK> s almost every saturday in <UNK> <UNK> when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some <UNK> of shorts or something like that to no <UNK> i only recently discovered that it was a <UNK> film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the <UNK> mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
<START> i remember watching this as a child in the uk <UNK> by the story and laurence <UNK> narration we would talk about nothing else at school the next day i imagine the ratings for the first showing were huge this is quite simply the best most <UNK> documentary series despite the fact they had to cut the story down to the bone they managed to capture so much what is interesting is that the battles of britain and north africa were pivotal yet are widely <UNK> as such by americans the series captures the rivalry between <UNK> and the american <UNK> the suffering of german troops on the eastern front the <UNK> of japanese prisoners of war by american troops the images of the holocaust made me a non jewish european feel forever guilty about the treatment of the jewish people i don't know why this is not number one in the imdb <UNK> perhaps they are showing their bias against documentaries spoiler we win
<START> my favorite movie what a great story this really was i'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible
<START> some of the filmmakers who are <UNK> in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series particularly the writing ok the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink i'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing new or genuinely interesting few of them are visually creative it's just typical <UNK> hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity other then that this series blows hard i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> to write the episodes maybe they did
<START> normally i am a pretty generous critic but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be br br there were some gorgeous shots but it's too bad they were wasted on this <UNK> of a movie it might have worked if <UNK> was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle there is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between <UNK> and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly this may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word <UNK> in particular reminded me of <UNK> grade not head over heels together forever worth dying for love i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward i was <UNK> in my seat ready to <UNK> but mostly i just <UNK> a lot br br spoiler br br now the <UNK> on the cake or rather adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their <UNK> fight and screaming and yelling and <UNK> at each other oh and then it starts to snow randomly oh and then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in heart suddenly pops up out of the <UNK> then she throws a <UNK> that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination even <UNK> conveniently <UNK> to hit a tiny blood <UNK> wow cool br br well then <UNK> dies finally i guess because she threw the <UNK> that was <UNK> in her chest and <UNK> to death <UNK> sings <UNK> holds her body close screen goes blank i and the people surrounding me are <UNK> not a good sign br br visually stunning but ultimately a failure
<START> the plot sounds vaguely interesting a scientist <UNK> discovers how to transplant animal eyes and <UNK> nerves into other animals like humans a young man <UNK> is <UNK> saving a <UNK> at work the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human <UNK> the <UNK> starts becoming more and wolf like but the effect is nothing more than weird eyes and running at night with dogs for the whole movie the budget is too low the dialogue too stilted i laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk and the acting too inept long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild way too long even at 90 minutes boring and devoid of ideas br br the military want to use the eye <UNK> to give wounded soldiers back their <UNK> and presumably want to <UNK> the technology there's a silly subplot about a beautiful indian girl <UNK> who thinks she can help using indian wisdom about the wolves they make love while music heavy on drums and indian <UNK> is heard crazy man the love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder who edited this turkey a <UNK> medicine man who <UNK> <UNK> seems to do little except for adding atmosphere br br here's two ridiculous scenes a worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their <UNK> she gets scared looks left at the monkeys turns right turns left turns right turns left this goes on for a while who edited this run out of the damn lab it was so stupid i started laughing another ridiculous scene our hero is at home escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive he leaves the window open the military guys go to the open window look out the window they say looks like he was here and leave he went out the open window guys crazy br br near the end of the movie military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees when obviously nothing is there easier to place the <UNK> i guess they have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife shoot the guy who wrote this trash there's a pointless confrontation at the end and believe me i'm not spoiling anything for you there's not enough plot to spoil br br i figure the whole thing was a tax write off or a rush job to make use of <UNK> budget money left over from some better movie
<START> this was just horrible the plot was just ok but the rest of the was was bad i mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse normally i would like low budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on i have about ten low budget movie set with like 6 8 movies on them and i would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them also the <UNK> is off and they use a fake plastic <UNK> that doesn't even look like a real one they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and don't watch this <UNK> movie
<START> a friend <UNK> me this dvd which he got from the director at a festival i think i went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie br br the <UNK> where the actors <UNK> <UNK> was really good as ernie the main character kind of pathetic in a likable way adam jones who also directed and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad the bill character justin lane who spends a lot of the film dressed like a <UNK> was by far my favorite he seemed the least one dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd really kind of lovable and very funny some of the other acting was good some was so so but none of it was bad i also really liked the vigilante duo ridiculous and funny br br i'm giving this one high marks even though it has some issues because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared and decided to make their movie their way well done to adam jones and crew
<START> it appears even the director doesn't like this film but for me i think he's being a bit harsh on himself br br sure it's not perfect but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout br br it's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well br br if you like horror films shot in england give it a go br br i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'the devil's <UNK> which looks quite amazing br br there aren't enough english horror films for me so any that come along deserve our attention and this one isn't as bad as you may think
<START> i've recently watched this movie in a lazy sunday afternoon with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun this movie is a masterpiece of trash try to watch it with this purpose it hadn't been expected of course but the performance provided by the actors and <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely the best the weak script and the low cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things <UNK> was just retired from <UNK> <UNK> racing where he was a <UNK> technical <UNK> in the late 1980s and 1990s <UNK> won three olympic gold <UNK> two world <UNK> and nine world cup season titles seriously about the director nobody knows why <UNK> <UNK> he has signed this movie all the other <UNK> directions are considerable
<START> whatever you become in your life you must never forget that you have roots this is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie i dare to say that this movie is well underrated this shows us a reality of life the more evil <UNK> you the better person you become trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy without <UNK> without living under a rock the movie concept is more that interesting connecting the storytelling with real life events keeping us aware of everything from facts to emotions bless these people and make everyone happy see it i recommend it to all young people it's not about racism it's about how to live your life
<START> a really sweet movie that has some similarities to the 2001 hit my sassy girl but is able to <UNK> most of the time the biggest applause should go to the two leads ha <UNK> kim is both sweet and quirky sang woo <UNK> is both attractive and rebellious the chemistry between the two is very good br br director <UNK> <UNK> kim uses some cg <UNK> to pepper up the visuals and also offers impressive fight scenes in which sang woo <UNK> can shine i liked him a lot better here than in the highly overrated <UNK> high and that boy has a future those looks those fight techniques and a romantic lead not bad br br well i can make it short nice film my rating 7 10
<START> i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as the return of the texas chainsaw massacre but this film compete with it br br <UNK> not a person that get asleep when watching a movie but i did it 15 minutes after the <UNK> started i woke up and started to watching it <UNK> why did i deserve that all the movie was a torture i have to use fast forward to watch it complete br br i <UNK> stand why one of my favourites actors of all time mr walken could done this thing i have to think that he made the director a favor or he was really in the need of money because film after film he is doing he is ruining himself and so fast br br what about the movie it¬¥s not scary stupid plot characters are awful but i really liked the one played by jared harris effects are very poor lack of deaths blood etc in three words it has anything and i mean it <UNK> stand how a director can make a film like this br br anyway when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover that the film was presented by stephen king i think he could never present this crap no i rented it in <UNK> i not recommend it in a million years br br i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 as i say in my return of the texas chainsaw massacre review there will be always a worse movies thats why it <UNK> deserves a 1 out of 10
<START> i actually paid to see this movie in the theater br br it would get a 1 rating but the fight scenes between the robots are okay and there's a surprise br br i realize that some movies have larger budgets than others i don't have a problem with that unfortunately science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons but one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap i mean couldn't they even make it look good br br the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect i might just enjoy it for the cheese factor but at the time i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being br br thankfully the experience was over in only 85 minutes
<START> very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a 1 10 i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity watch it don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing happy birthday and el <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> song for kids i think it could also be south american i'm not sure this two songs that have the same melody but people don't usually realize that it's just <UNK> i tried to write this in both spanish and english because it's an <UNK> movie but the page wouldn't allow me hope you enjoy it
<START> this is a more interesting than usual porn movie because it is a fantasy adventure the production values are high and the acting is believe it or not pretty good especially jenna jameson it s also in widescreen which helps it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn movie but of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes fine atmosphere and scenery and by the way the sex is hot br br watch out for this one
<START> the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary it's one of man's primal fears this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so it's not really working out in a particularly gory scene we find so so actor earl <UNK> having his teeth completely destroyed with <UNK> and <UNK> which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist it's a typical brian <UNK> situation not well written but there's gore the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey it's a killer dentist movie we've all thought of it but they did it first
<START> in a college <UNK> a guy is killed by somebody with a <UNK> his girlfriend beth <UNK> barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she's <UNK> a year later she's out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful <UNK> in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again br br lousy slasher thriller a <UNK> example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots <UNK> themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to <UNK> this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there's one real gruesome one but that's not till the end br br with a few exceptions the acting sucks <UNK> barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz <UNK> allen pops up as brad and he's terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff <UNK> pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job br br logic <UNK> abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex <UNK> non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one br br rated r for graphic violence and some profanity
<START> <UNK> 2006 ' was created over a period of six years co <UNK> by france <UNK> and the united kingdom at a cost of around <UNK> million the final result is a <UNK> accomplishment of comic book style animation <UNK> similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with <UNK> city 2005 ' but this film employed motion capture with live actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format presented in stark black and white the film looks as though it has been <UNK> from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based and the futuristic city of paris <UNK> <UNK> above us directed by french filmmaker christian <UNK> in his feature length debut <UNK> draws significantly from other films in the science fiction genre and the tech noir storyline isn't something we haven't seen before but from a technical standpoint it is <UNK> br br the year is <UNK> the city of paris is a <UNK> metropolis filled with dark <UNK> and deserted <UNK> the recent <UNK> of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> buildings the city's largest corporation <UNK> achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth and the <UNK> research department is continually <UNK> to <UNK> greater means of <UNK> the aging process <UNK> <UNK> voiced by <UNK> <UNK> in the english language version which i watched a brilliant young scientist is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work and so it falls to legendary detective <UNK> <UNK> daniel craig to <UNK> her current <UNK> possibly holding the key to the woman's disappearance is <UNK> catherine <UNK> <UNK> hardened elder sister whose <UNK> is in question and <UNK> <UNK> ian <UNK> the dedicated medical doctor who <UNK> <UNK> as his own daughter br br the eerie <UNK> lit city of paris is reminiscent of <UNK> scott's <UNK> runner 1982 ' and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in <UNK> report 2002 ' which was <UNK> also set in the year <UNK> however despite this <UNK> <UNK> has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit <UNK> classic film noir and science fiction the result is an eye catching <UNK> of harsh lighting and dark shadows which i should warn occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer's eyes the dialogue is a little banal at times and the story though engaging doesn't offer anything strikingly original except for the ending which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula but <UNK> is intended to work best as a visual treat and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied
<START> there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is <UNK> behind a bush by the trail i thought i had seen bad but this is it a white van in a western did they not catch this oh well and i paid top dollar at the rental it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie the talking was so so slow the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming there is a door at the <UNK> that looks like a door today with the particular <UNK> i say watch this movie and move cabin boy into 2 on the worst of all time
<START> mighty <UNK> power rangers came out in 1993 supposedly based on the japanese <UNK> television show that started back in the 1970s now as a fan of japanese action films and series you would think i would get a kick out of this show br br you could not be more wrong what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty <UNK> power rangers br br <UNK> is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes <UNK> <UNK> with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot br br now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie yet the <UNK> of this show is often overlooked br br it was followed by two really bad and i do mean really bad movie knock offs and the actors starring in this series completely disappeared from the scene br br if you must choose try watching <UNK> <UNK> series instead br br also what's up with the awful long 1990s <UNK> and all the <UNK> on the guys it makes them all look feminine
<START> john waters has made the most <UNK> <UNK> heartfelt dark personal little film i think i've ever seen well maybe fast food fast women comes in close second the directors vision is <UNK> the narrative is whimsical the characters are personal and odd <UNK> of family and his own inner life the tone never forced or <UNK> over arch br br there is no pretentious shot design <UNK> or magazine <UNK> martha <UNK> is amazing as the sister eddie <UNK> is inspired casting a grandmother with a talking mary tea <UNK> recycled clothing <UNK> garbage becomes today's art and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family and a humble life
<START> wow i don't know what to say i just watched seven pounds no one can make me cry like will smith the man is very in tune with the vast range of human emotion this movie was <UNK> and beautifully done rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today i would compare it to pay it forward and crash as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one not usually one for a bad ending but rather a truth <UNK> that <UNK> emotion raw life and something more than the <UNK> that exists in abundance all around therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end it is true to life that there aren't always happy endings sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you'll love this movie
<START> dull predictable and uninteresting story of a man <UNK> by a chemical substance <UNK> who goes on across the country just to find his ex wife and children meanwhile he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands in his dangerous track a doctor hurt and a young reporter natasha try to stop the man the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better the final result is just a movie without suspense or <UNK> moments even the good cast is completely waste i give this a 4 four
<START> this movie was rather awful <UNK> <UNK> last movie was good this one was just bad although it's a good story and is handled in a great way <UNK> <UNK> who adapted this movie from another <UNK> play <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made a good but slow <UNK> 2 and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but it's still a entertainer songs are rather <UNK> out and don't work well but they're still good overall not a movie you would <UNK> watch it's still a story to take in to account and it's good if you're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor that's really not needed even one bit
<START> there is good there is bad and then their is the sentinel a bottom barrel political thriller that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered directed with ham handed <UNK> by clark johnson every actor in this film seems to be working on <UNK> even the great michael douglas looks bored here i can honestly say i have never in all my life viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes the twist is predictable from square one and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience avoid this at all costs this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value
<START> now this film isn't going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller one well that's three reasons isn't it br br the first reason this is interesting is the special effects i found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular to see the hair growing on <UNK> a hunt and <UNK> <UNK> was creepy especially when they were <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br of interest is the fact that this <UNK> hunt is the famous brown sugar of the rolling stones song and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the london cast of the rock musical hair br br besides the special effects there were two other points of note in this film and they were brought out repeatedly during the closing credits i lost count but i swear that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> those points for us in the closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more <UNK> were the most outstanding feature of the film
<START> i have to agree with most of the other <UNK> was it a comedy a drama to me it <UNK> a little to much towards the comedy side i could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was horribly contrived jamie keeps running into the <UNK> and whats his name in new york how many times do you run into someone you know in downtown cleveland and just how could robert <UNK> dig up <UNK> stadium to hide the gold again a comedy or drama but it was still entertaining especially for a sunday morning i enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> performance she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously she is a younger actress that is going to be <UNK>
<START> despite its rather <UNK> title this is a light teen <UNK> unless you're an old <UNK> you'll probably find it likeable it isn't so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that you've been running back and forth to the kitchen even if you've been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer <UNK> is the <UNK> of many i know but i've always liked the more obscure <UNK> corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of <UNK> from those <UNK> grown ups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike
<START> i am an actor producer director and what i am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a big joke why would blockbuster released such crap i take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make a bad movie i don't think so i seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the <UNK> and everything on the damn table this movie sucks i really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself but please consider in taking up a different profession i respect the fact that you completed a movie but i have to ask you were you smoking crack i mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if i could have voted zero i would have worst film in movie making history
<START> the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might <UNK> everyone involved in the <UNK> of his tomb the soul <UNK> makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy one by one the blood is <UNK> from those involved in the dig br br to be as brief as possible <UNK> curse is quite the lackluster affair while the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking <UNK> soul <UNK> interesting make up effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding to make matters even worse the first 15 of the film's relatively short <UNK> minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but <UNK> curse <UNK> even my patients the cast helps very little with only one exception <UNK> <UNK> is the lone bright spot ¬ñ wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay finally i don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy looking servant in what appears to be <UNK> but it's a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to <UNK> fear in the audience br br despite my mostly negative comments on the <UNK> curse i'm going to rate it a 4 10 not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems i have with the movie
<START> director vincenzo natali first showed his <UNK> for character based sci fi flicks with his 1997 short film <UNK> <UNK> 3 people remain trapped in an elevator while unseen monsters <UNK> the building his follow up feature project cube released later that year had a very similar premise this time with 6 people and instead of an elevator it was a vast <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> both were admirable attempts to take the sci fi genre a step further by deliberately <UNK> to show almost any visual <UNK> choosing instead to spend as much time as possible focusing on the human element how the characters act react and interact under incomprehensible and dangerous conditions after his exploration into the mainstream with <UNK> cypher natali has come back to his bizarre character film trend to bring us nothing his latest and by far most optimistic and comedic take on the wide cinematic world of what if br br dave david <UNK> and andrew andrew miller are life long friends brought together by a mutual <UNK> from society and a lack of any one else to be with dave who has always been <UNK> by a selfish and somewhat <UNK> nature lives rent free with andrew at his ill located and ill constructed house where he often takes advantage of <UNK> neurotic and <UNK> mentality despite all this the two <UNK> are happy together until one day their deep character flaws coupled with some <UNK> bad luck land them in the middle of some pretty serious jail sentence worthy trouble on top of this they discover that their house has been deemed <UNK> for existence and is <UNK> to be <UNK> before sunset so in the <UNK> nightmarish panic of everything going wrong for them they wish that the whole world would just disappear and it does br br going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film's slow occasionally too slow reveal about what's happened to dave and andrew and how they deal with their new reality <UNK> fascination with studying human behavior under <UNK> ala the birds is here in <UNK> but simply by making the main characters friends rather than strangers he's able to break away from the thriller horror element of this premise to open it up to a more comfortable and optimistic level it's almost as if he's made the <UNK> opposite of cube br br of course the film is not 85 minutes of laughter and sunshine in keeping with fundamental realism our two anti <UNK> dynamic often becomes <UNK> sometimes with rather nasty results like the desert island game the film looks at how even best friends when left alone together can fall apart but at the same time it shows that friends are vital to the quality of existence in a very twisted sci fi way this is a feel good flick with good heart and good intentions br br however there are a few <UNK> to be had with nothing while the two lead actors <UNK> and miller do well with their parts their characters are not nearly as interesting as they should have been considering it is completely up to them to entertain us for the better part of an hour there is some development in the relationship and personalities of dave and andrew some background is given but ultimately not enough a generous viewer will sit through the less engaging portions of the film to see it through to the end but <UNK> will probably give up pretty fast br br acting as mentioned is adequate and considering the amount of <UNK> <UNK> work that would've been needed reasonably convincing david <UNK> and andrew miller who both wrote co wrote the screenplay have been long time friends of vincenzo natali <UNK> has in fact featured in every film natali has made perhaps it was their creative <UNK> that <UNK> this film in a more positive direction nonetheless the story could have been a lot more involving granted it is relatively entertaining considering that no pun intended nothing really happens but you get the impression that in more experienced hands a lot more could've been done with this premise br br in all fairness nothing is an impressive piece of work in many ways the concept is interesting the direction is inventive the script works on a human level and most of all it shows a progression in <UNK> creative mentality for fans of his work this will be a delight and for others it will be a nice way to pass a little <UNK> time it's just a shame that the director's <UNK> on human drama prevented it from being the great fun film it could have been
<START> badly made dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to <UNK> out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull shocking that this film is considered for an award at the <UNK> film festival br br everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i what was the point of even making the film the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly i am <UNK> that this film has been given a release very very disappointing and a waste of my time sorry terribly negative review but hopefully will <UNK> some people from making the same mistake what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film now that could have been interesting
<START> who wouldn't want to go on road trip with peter falk that guy's right eye has more character than most actors today this is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a <UNK> to all the <UNK> special effects <UNK> women are going to love it for all the wake up romance advice for men and men will love it for its spot on father son character study one great little scene after another and it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find obviously this is a labor of love for paul reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life the most fun part though was watching reiser watch falk you could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying peter <UNK> special craft really delightful let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with paul reiser and folks
<START> there are laughs in this film that is for sure michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny before he decided he was a serious actor however what bothers me so much about this film is how unlikable practically all of the characters are other than the main two leads everybody is a jerk i mean these small town losers are about as <UNK> as you can get you just watch and think man these losers should be unemployed moreover the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and <UNK> <UNK> it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese <UNK> oh sure in the end they all come together as one but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there
<START> first off i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget sci fi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was a mindless hour and a half the cg was not as bad as i was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically a chinese <UNK> of dragons returning every 500 years sounds like a good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and a very small actual war between dragons rather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thing along with all 5 of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest i've seen a lot of b movies like <UNK> the cave spider and others but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour watch this br br story 1 10 cg 5 10 acting 3 10 br br i don't drink but it would have helped before watching this movie
<START> jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in <UNK> with a chemical <UNK> filled with a chemical that turns his <UNK> with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small town br br i don't think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick just put your brain on hold and have fun with it but just don't take it too seriously
<START> boy oh boy oh <UNK> gee br br the most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the <UNK> effects used to create mom's <UNK> they looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie br br i did not end up loving this movie the attempted <UNK> shots were really pathetic as well i mean hey if they had a low budget flick that's fine you can still make a great movie with a low budget but a bad movie and a low budget and effects that makes for a bad combination in this case such a doomed <UNK> created the <UNK> film invisible mom if you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one
<START> this ensemble piece about adults who return to the <UNK> summer camp of their youth was a very quiet <UNK> and <UNK> to the cinemas in the <UNK> of 1993 i'd say that was a shame but then again some of the better movies are quiet releases that don't get much hype or praise br br diane lane kevin <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> vincent <UNK> julie warner bill paxton <UNK> williams matt craven and alan arkin who is painfully good here are the group of actors who flesh out these roles as people who have grown old with good bad and funny memories of <UNK> gone past this film covers the <UNK> of emotions mostly pleasant and the film never <UNK> away at the viewer to feel what the characters are feeling <UNK> to allow the viewer to enter into the memories on their own since i am a movie viewer who <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> manipulation in films this is something that i appreciate from writer director mike <UNK> br br this film's a great cheap rent a good main rent and even a pretty sit in a theater flick you might run across this on tv and i would definitely suggest a look see
<START> r <UNK> tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> in a <UNK> way this time it is mixed with mature <UNK> br br amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian <UNK> in london he is very <UNK> and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job according to him cooking is an art still cannot make <UNK> <UNK> properly br br enter <UNK> who sends her the proper <UNK> <UNK> made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each <UNK> amitabh is <UNK> and <UNK> is <UNK> no <UNK> but one <UNK> <UNK> father <UNK> <UNK> the couples decide to meet the father for the <UNK> of their marriage but amitabh realizes that <UNK> father is much younger to him and the complications <UNK> performance wise all three actors are brilliant the script of the film is very tight and interesting the dialogues of the film are catchy but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled the comedy is sometimes not properly understood the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts br br <UNK> nothing much to sing about except the title track the camera work is good director r <UNK> could have given much better from this script but in the second half he himself looks confused the <UNK> scene of the father looked irritating but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are <UNK> worthy br br on the whole <UNK> <UNK> needed to have more sugar
<START> this movie <UNK> too much in its own innocence it doesn't tell a story it's more a big time <UNK> fest while the actors are all <UNK> the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor <UNK> has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real <UNK>
<START> this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who after his <UNK> is decapitated goes around <UNK> <UNK> so that he can find a suitable body to <UNK> her <UNK> to everyone in this movie exudes more <UNK> than a <UNK> particularly our protagonist
<START> a family traveling for their daughter's <UNK> league decide to take the <UNK> <UNK> and end up in the middle of nowhere the father is an avid photographer and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town he decides to take another <UNK> to take some photographs br br of course the side show is filled with <UNK> freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to <UNK> for themselves br br the only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their <UNK> <UNK> other than that there's nothing worthwhile about the film
<START> as a <UNK> and non christian i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith but what a load of i <UNK> i thought the film would have great arguments but only got one sided views from <UNK> and jews and who are all these street people he's <UNK> who don't know the back of their arm from their head where are the proper <UNK> and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti christ told me so please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help <UNK> reading this feel better about themselves but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then <UNK> us with your worth not your beating off the drums
<START> this was the second of two filmed <UNK> in the nineties the first being franco <UNK> starring mel gibson from 1990 <UNK> version like laurence <UNK> from 1948 was based upon an <UNK> version of the play with much of shakespeare's original text being cut i have never seen tony <UNK> 1969 version but as that ran to less than two hours shorter even than <UNK> i presume that was also <UNK> kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious a film based on the complete text of the play with a running time of around four hours br br with his henry v branagh claimed <UNK> crown as the <UNK> leading shakespearean <UNK> his claim with his brilliant much <UNK> about nothing a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy hamlet was his third shakespeare film as director he also acted as <UNK> in oliver <UNK> 1995 othello and as one might expect it is very different to much <UNK> the earlier film shot in a villa in the hills of <UNK> and the beautiful surrounding countryside is a <UNK> <UNK> film about everything that makes life worth living br br hamlet by contrast is set in the depths of winter the flowers in the description of <UNK> death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer the look of the film is particularly striking both <UNK> and <UNK> it was filmed at <UNK> palace possibly <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> home but also a rather <UNK> one the snowy exterior scenes are cold and <UNK> the interior ones <UNK> and elaborate the action is updated to the mid <UNK> century the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms there is a contrast here with <UNK> film where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone the play is dominated by images of corruption and <UNK> branagh's intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying something rotten in the state of <UNK> br br the film is notable for the large number of big name actors some of them in very minor roles blink and you might miss john <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> apparently an all star cast was required by the production company who were nervous about a four hour film some of the <UNK> hollywood stars such as robin <UNK> <UNK> did not really come off but others like charlton <UNK> player king or billy <UNK> first <UNK> played their parts very well <UNK> normally only seen as a skull is here seen in flashback played by the british comedian ken <UNK> brian blessed who often plays <UNK> characters is cast against type as the ghost and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening br br of the major characters perhaps the weakest was kate <UNK> <UNK> branagh's leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson but their marriage ended in divorce in 1995 i did however find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role although <UNK> came into her own in the <UNK> mad scenes she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane i preferred helena bonham carter in <UNK> version richard <UNK> plays <UNK> with a greater dignity than he is often given a wise and experienced <UNK> rather than a <UNK> old fool julie christie also brings dignity to the role of <UNK> there is no attempt here as there was with gibson and glenn close in the <UNK> version to suggest an incestuous <UNK> between her and hamlet an interpretation which owes more to <UNK> than it does to shakespeare the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son which was certainly not the case with close and gibson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> thirteen years younger than him br br branagh stated that his intention in <UNK> those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to <UNK> the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy much stress is placed upon the war with <UNK> and the norwegian prince <UNK> a subplot ignored altogether by <UNK> this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of <UNK> sometimes played as a one dimensional villain there is something about derek <UNK> performance which suggests that <UNK> could have been a good man under different circumstances but that he allowed himself to be led <UNK> by ambition and lust he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother but chose to rule as a bad king although he is tormented by guilt he can see no way to make <UNK> for the evil he has done br br branagh a wonderfully <UNK> <UNK> of shakespeare's <UNK> is superb in the main role like gibson he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as <UNK> passive and melancholy his is an active physical energetic hamlet something best shown in his fatal duel with <UNK> his <UNK> principle is not world weary despair but an active disgust with evil and corruption br br it was a <UNK> for branagh to make a four hour epic and the film did not do well at the box office it was however praised by many critics james <UNK> being particularly enthusiastic my own opinion is that whatever the financial returns may have been branagh's <UNK> paid off in artistic terms by <UNK> on the full text he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeare's most complex play when i reviewed his much <UNK> i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy his hamlet may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy 10 10
<START> <UNK> is a hit and miss picture starring goldie hawn as a <UNK> cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting arab from an assassination attempt the woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job working for the u s government will the corridors of power in our <UNK> capital ever be the same hawn is excellent as usual even though <UNK> isn't as funny as her best film private benjamin but it's still a good movie and i did laugh alot br br out of four
<START> despite the overwhelming cult following for this sad documentary i must admit to having <UNK> <UNK> the film which struck our party as far more a <UNK> exploitation piece than <UNK> informative that said after seeing the magnificent stage musical drawn from it one can appreciate what the film might have been in <UNK> hands br br one suspects that those many of us who <UNK> suffered through the film may have had any campy <UNK> its <UNK> fans enjoyed destroyed by the uncomfortable suspicion that too many of us or those we know are only a <UNK> or two away from the <UNK> plight of the two mad women depicted who live in and contribute to a <UNK> they seem incapable of controlling or escaping br br the film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how any person could have <UNK> to this level of <UNK> and unlike the musical offers no <UNK> clues or explanations only a horror show <UNK> by humor or insight br br this soul <UNK> <UNK> of the film makes the achievement of the stage version hopefully to be filmed ultimately for cable all the more remarkable act ii is faithful in almost every detail to the film under discussion but strangely setting the sad <UNK> plight to music raises the human tragedy to art even more important this act is <UNK> by a fine act i where we meet the women before their decent into <UNK> <UNK> madness and are offered hints how their isolated <UNK> came about in short everything which the film is lacking br br to the <UNK> credit or their <UNK> the excellent <UNK> dvd release includes out takes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film behind the scenes photographs interviews and commentary filling in some of the blank spots the original editing <UNK> decided to <UNK> in its drive for <UNK> horror and depression they can't make the amateurish film itself satisfying but they can at least make it a bit more <UNK> br br ultimately though it is only the remarkable stage piece inspired by and drawn from it by book writer doug wright composer scott <UNK> and <UNK> michael <UNK> which raises the rating of the original grey gardens above a single generous star
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was a good <UNK> mystery i confess i have not read the book despite being an avid agatha christie fan the adaptation isn't without its problems there were times when the humour and there were <UNK> attempts to get it right was a little overdone and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded however i loved how <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was filmed it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders and it really set the atmosphere what with the dark camera work and dark lighting the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a <UNK> adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two <UNK> my shoe which gave me nightmares the plot is complex with all the essential ingredients though not as convoluted as <UNK> my shoe and in some way that is a good thing the acting was very good david <UNK> is impeccable i know i can't use this word forever but i can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series as <UNK> and phillip jackson and pauline <UNK> do justice to their integral characters brilliantly and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole particularly <UNK> lewis as leonard all in all solid mystery but doesn't rank along the best 7 5 10 <UNK> cox
<START> was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of ed <UNK> facial hair without revealing any plot details on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very <UNK> <UNK> was in place it was much fuller than the <UNK> that went with the beard later on in the course of a dark night in the open the <UNK> was gone and he appeared <UNK> <UNK> this was on an occasion where stopping to <UNK> wouldn't be an option these continuity <UNK> totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had also i found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of de niro in taxi driver even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too <UNK> for this viewer
<START> the author of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> second feature film der <UNK> is a powerful masterpiece centered around a chain letter <UNK> from a group called the <UNK> of the <UNK> day the movie shows 7 episodes each <UNK> of one day during one week where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it's rounds do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals enjoy happy or even remotely normal movies or expect a movie to be good only if it is focused on stage acting br br the <UNK> avant garde approach of der <UNK> well explains why <UNK> movies in general were banned in germany their native country of origin during the 80's and most of the 90's der <UNK> is not really focused on the characters appearing on screen but the meaningless <UNK> or depression most people's lives consist of in general <UNK> does not find reasons to go on living only reasons to stop and in choosing how and when you die you can also be the king of death der <UNK> br br <UNK> movies are generally difficult to <UNK> and der <UNK> is no exception featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies art film would probably be the closest description every time der <UNK> features an original method to shoot create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene during one scene the camera slowly continuously pans in <UNK> degree circle while a person lives in a small one room apartment for a day during another <UNK> uses sound and film corruption to depict the <UNK> mental state of a man while he <UNK> in his desperation during a third seemingly pleasant scene names ages and <UNK> of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on screen supposedly <UNK> the <UNK> in germany for this particular movie br br episode movies and especially this one as the scenes are only vaguely connected generally suffer from <UNK> and der <UNK> is no exception while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it's consequences or <UNK> in all it's variations there are very powerful episodes yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material partly <UNK> the overall power of the movie still the the jaw dropping immensely powerful <UNK> depicting a <UNK> body manage to keep the movie together and <UNK> it from it's more vague moments back to the status of greatness the general atmosphere is <UNK> awe inspiring highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of br br this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans this is a small different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience whether it be confusion <UNK> or even hate you aren't likely to be left cold by this in my opinion the best achievement of this small indie crew br br the main theme of the movie die <UNK> ins <UNK> der <UNK> part i iii was released in a limited <UNK> piece 8 <UNK> edition which is now much sought after you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting the <UNK> soundtrack cd which i highly recommend the lo fi <UNK> music in the movie is dark and quirky almost <UNK> like makes an essential part of the movie's atmosphere and is something you would very very rarely hear otherwise much recommended
<START> this is a great movie i like it where <UNK> climbs down to get his <UNK> and the <UNK> chase him but luckily he <UNK> them opened the window and didn't even notice them <UNK> <UNK> is very pretty too when he stuck the <UNK> up ma <UNK> butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his <UNK> while watching <UNK> guy kill many people then you see him <UNK> <UNK> as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the 90s
<START> the movie is very realistic absolutely it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be <UNK> in a perfect manner and where every move is precise the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts their everyday life adventures overall the movie <UNK> the viewer to a depressed state this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent not everything happens the way we think it should happen i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note we watch we learn we experience ourselves that is probably the moral of this story
<START> i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get go when miss stanwyck starts her narration it's only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it here it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really <UNK> even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white <UNK> award
<START> this movie is one of those wow movies not because it's the greatest movie of all time but because it surprised me not only was it a t v movie but it was on elvis i can safely say as many <UNK> as there are there was only one elvis but i can also safely say that kurt <UNK> came extremely close to being the real thing it was one of the greatest <UNK> that i have ever seen he had me believing that it was really him i learned a lot about <UNK> life from watching this movie and don't led the television part of it let you stray it's actually a really fantastic film and kurt <UNK> could've been <UNK> twin
<START> hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time <UNK> with no thought required there are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies a pretty good cast with donald sutherland john <UNK> and the lovely <UNK> <UNK> this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one on a scale of one to ten a 4
<START> had this film been put together a tad better it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers as it is it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot i e randolph scott <UNK> <UNK> sister played by harriet <UNK> that's <UNK> <UNK> wife to you baby <UNK> br br astaire and scott are two navy men scott meets <UNK> the first time when she looks like a stereotypical <UNK> and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend a blond but <UNK> lucille ball to <UNK> her up meanwhile astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off the result is some wonderful dance numbers with astaire and rogers as a team as well as <UNK> i'm putting all my eggs in one basket let yourself go and i'd rather lead the band <UNK> is sweet but a little <UNK> as a plain jane turned <UNK> girl although she sings her two songs well but where are you and get <UNK> behind me satan one poster didn't care for that song but i love the title rogers is <UNK> and a youthful astaire is a <UNK> br br the highlight of the movie comes at the end with let's face the music and dance one of the most <UNK> beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire in it they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and fantasy it is truly to be <UNK> and watched again and again
<START> typical 90's comedy <UNK> comedy similar to our modern day my family <UNK> being the height of most political jokes bill <UNK> lang blames <UNK> for anything she can bloody <UNK> possibly shared with most of us david the typical teenager cutting up brains with bread knives jenny the moody older teenage child only interested in boys and more boys bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family <UNK> struggling within the <UNK> climate of the early 90's granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however series 3 <UNK> is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count overall this show didn't get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer clearly they couldn't have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of catherine <UNK> the office little britain and bring back the classics
<START> on the night of his bachelor party paul coleman jason lee meets the gorgeous dancer <UNK> julia stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed his future mother in law calls him and informs that his fianc√©e karen <UNK> blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks <UNK> to leave his place in a hurry sooner he finds that her has <UNK> and later in the <UNK> of his wedding dinner party he realizes that <UNK> is the cousin of karen this is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations the first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor julia stiles and <UNK> blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and jason lee who is amazingly funny have good performances i laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious for example when paul finds <UNK> in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the <UNK> trying to buy and get explanations about the <UNK> medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of <UNK> paul i could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crazy for them
<START> although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars frank sinatra gene kelly kathryn grayson and director george sidney a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to <UNK> at and in <UNK> the line up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws br br sinatra and kelly are clarence <UNK> and joseph brady respectively two navy men as the film begins they're just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola <UNK> is still a bit wet behind the ears appropriately enough and seeks advice on women from brady in private <UNK> scriptwriter <UNK> <UNK> and sidney have all of the navy men <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> with women to each other brady promises to help get <UNK> hooked up but primarily because <UNK> won't leave him alone otherwise a <UNK> is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy he won't give the police any information about who he is or where he lives brady helps and he and <UNK> end up taking the boy back home when the boy's guardian susan <UNK> grayson finally shows up <UNK> goes <UNK> for her brady tries to convince him to forget about her brady just wants to get back to lola but they keep getting <UNK> back to <UNK> home and eventually something of a love triangle forms things become more complicated when brady lies about <UNK> knowing a famous musician jose iturbi who is in <UNK> at a film studio and claims that <UNK> has set up an audition for <UNK> who is a singer and actress in front of iturbi br br because of the story the music is a strange combination of <UNK> music because of the navy premise obviously broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more <UNK> settings opera what <UNK> character excels at <UNK> like popular classical what iturbi did and mexican music because <UNK> <UNK> a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l a the combination doesn't work as well as it could plenty of the songs are good and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician but the genre <UNK> tends to lose <UNK> worse there are a couple showcases for iturbi who was apparently a big star at the time that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music robert altman's kansas city 1996 but that <UNK> stopped the plot to <UNK> turn into a concert film anchors aweigh takes a similar <UNK> yes this is a musical but there's a difference between songs that <UNK> and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like <UNK> <UNK> material br br there are also some plot problems it's not very well established why brady is so against <UNK> pursuit of <UNK> we can guess that brady thinks <UNK> shouldn't become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid and who seems relatively proper and traditional but on the other hand brady can tell that <UNK> doesn't have the same <UNK> <UNK> that brady admits of himself <UNK> seems like a good fit for <UNK> and furthermore <UNK> works hard to establish that brady just wants to get <UNK> out of his hair and get on with meeting lola it seems that <UNK> character should be quickly <UNK> <UNK> off on any candidate whether she's a good fit or not this might seem like a minor detail but it's actually the <UNK> for about a third to half of the plot the story also seems a bit drawn out length is a problem anchors aweigh <UNK> in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes should have been cut down by at least a half hour br br the above surely sounds like i'm complaining about the film too much to justify an 8 i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws br br sinatra kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic <UNK> and together they turn in good interesting performances sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of <UNK> ¬ñ 30 while shooting he plays an unusually <UNK> <UNK> character completely different than most of the roles he would take later and different than his public image as a <UNK> for kelly this was his breakthrough film and rightfully so his choreography is varied and impressive as is his acting grayson is charming her performance is <UNK> understated and she's simply gorgeous all of this helps <UNK> the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing br br and there's even a very interesting element that probably only <UNK> because sidney was allowed to <UNK> over a large variety of <UNK> the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse of tom and jerry fame in an extended fantasy sequence this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you're a fan of fantasy the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson where brady is imagining <UNK> in a scene from a period film while he <UNK> her having to resort to <UNK> stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony br br as uneven and flawed as the film is it is largely successful and entertaining to watch fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn't miss anchors aweigh and neither should sinatra fans <UNK> get quite a kick out of his character
<START> truly awful film made by cinematographer turned director ted <UNK> decent enough looking film but for a time bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here <UNK> though this one with his characteristic <UNK> there are some details thrown around canadian ex army or <UNK> <UNK> bombs in the war his wife is leaving him but none of these back stories add up to much the <UNK> himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this <UNK> of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or <UNK> i assumed the latter which makes <UNK> motive even more <UNK> generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good time bomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger <UNK> for a more exciting time at about the same running time
<START> do not waste your time watching this unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good film i am not one to usually review a movie but this one is personal i wasted precious time which they cannot give back i feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap if this was a student project i would have to say not bad but only for the first 15 min after that it gets annoying the screaming the bad audio the bad video a good camera man could have made it much better and yes whats with the blair witch effect no budget i was hoping it was going to get better but it doesn't now how the hell did it deserves a 4 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time i have said my peace
<START> after her oscar nominated turn in secrets lies brenda <UNK> starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every day br br after her husband commits suicide grace <UNK> brenda <UNK> discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana that's right grace starts <UNK> it br br every aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn't see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little <UNK> after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing one's <UNK> but of course there's a lot more to it than that
<START> i'm afraid this one is pretty dreadful despite several good performances and generally competent acting for the camera direction it's a first and last attempt by writer director <UNK> <UNK> rub and <UNK> 2002 is one of the unfortunate by products of <UNK> program to promote home grown film making while the program encourages worthwhile efforts like new <UNK> girl it opens the door for <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> who did not have to <UNK> pitch this project but was green <UNK> without an adequate examination of her script or her <UNK> br br you don't mind the low budget because the <UNK> production design bad lighting poor audio and dreary <UNK> style shot selection is consistent with the subject matter the workers in canadian <UNK> <UNK> but the dialogue and the plotting doesn't give the actors anything to work with the editor much to <UNK> or a viewer any mental challenge other than suspension of disbelief when your story is this simplistic the last thing you need is a muddled storytelling technique even though nothing happens the movie is hard to follow and point of view impossible to pin down br br don <UNK> performance as conrad is several <UNK> below his similar characterization in <UNK> lindy <UNK> <UNK> is her standard quirky <UNK> as always she is likable but here she is little else <UNK> <UNK> cindy is a pleasant surprise a kind of asian shelley <UNK> the only other role of any consequence tara spencer <UNK> street wise betty more than <UNK> out her excellent performance in new <UNK> girl her shallow performance in rub and <UNK> should <UNK> any tendency to seek out other films in which she has appeared unless you need further <UNK> of <UNK> director alan <UNK> skill in working with young actors br br you quickly conclude that <UNK> <UNK> brain cannot grasp concepts like plot complexity so the need to insert a lazy and lame <UNK> ex <UNK> device toward the end is hardly a surprise still it could be worse the <UNK> story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all i can say is what did i just watch and i mean that in a good and bad way br br the plot is really simple stiller and black play friends neighbors stiller is the focused <UNK> while black is a <UNK> black <UNK> this idea to create a <UNK> that <UNK> poo the idea becomes very popular and black becomes very rich the <UNK> lifestyle that black <UNK> and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with stiller causes stiller to become crazy with envy br br as i said the plot is simple everything else is plain odd the direction is odd with a weird <UNK> opening shot to out of nowhere <UNK> up sequences the <UNK> and the acting is very odd odd in a rambling sort of way and the sound track is the <UNK> thing in the movie from the weird envy song that keeps on <UNK> to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in japanese br br so the true question is this is odd funny that depends purely on the individual i was cracking up at the <UNK> <UNK> weirdness of the movie after the screening i heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free strangely i understood their point there are no jokes whatsoever so if you aren't hooked by the <UNK> of it all you will hate this movie absolutely hate it br br this movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a dvd cult classic if you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes like cable guy or punch drunk love then i suggest you see it if you don't run away from this movie it'll only make you mad
<START> this is a review of the wizard not to be confused with the <UNK> or mr wizard the wizard is a late eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits the <UNK> is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz and mr wizard is that guy that attached 100 <UNK> together and had some kid drink <UNK> out of it br br now that we've gotten all that out of the way let me say this there's really no reason to see this movie it's simply a 100 minute <UNK> commercial designed to capitalize on the <UNK> the legend of <UNK> and super mario brothers 3 i use the word designed in the <UNK> sense possible because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played <UNK> and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together they'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to <UNK> school to learn how to <UNK> car <UNK> br br i hope that this has been an <UNK> experience for you it sure hasn't been for me in fact i think i might have lost a few <UNK> in the act of watching this movie and writing about it next time you're at the video store and you see the the <UNK> the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead
<START> i enjoyed it in general i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi i'm also partial to sci fi fantasy and the dinosaur <UNK> i read for pleasure but when i'm feeling over <UNK> or really mind dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex <UNK> me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesn't really matter to me and no i'm not a juvenile nor am i a moron
<START> here we go with other slasher movie good looking people and acting from everyone was really good br br few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids 20 years after they are still friends they go to huge house have fun drugs and sex no nudity for least half a hour of the movie again they start making pranks phone call all over again and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in big black coat with axe just like urban legend movie br br deaths scene really weird really odd times too br br nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7 10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless br br the twist killed the movie for me so i going to give it 4 10
<START> this film is riveting but in much the same way a car crash is riveting it's hard to look away overall this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and a <UNK> biased experiment at that the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible <UNK> the manner in which the money is presented to ted is pure exploitation the <UNK> steps that the filmmakers force ted to participate in meeting with so called experts were empty and devoid of any <UNK> attempt to connect with ted instead it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the <UNK> <UNK> and to further exploit ted's situation the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after 6 months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before if they had cared they would have found better experts to help ted if they truly wanted to see what ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without any <UNK> this film is at best a high brow jackass stunt and not a documentary it's sad to think how much 100 000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands
<START> first time director tom <UNK> turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a <UNK> budget yet had the flavor of the early <UNK> brother's film blood simple and throw in some monty python <UNK> to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writer director actor
<START> the title is the sound that one of the characters makes as he drives his imaginary <UNK> across the garbage dump where the characters live the film is based on a series of stories by <UNK> <UNK> and tells the story of a group of people who effectively live in <UNK> homes on the edge of the dump it's a mix of laughter and sadness br br first color film made by <UNK> <UNK> has been something i've wanted to see for a long time <UNK> it was often listed as being only available in a <UNK> version from a three or four hour original due to an error in the run time in some <UNK> material i was holding out for the full version waiting to see what <UNK> wanted us to see only to find out on the recent release by <UNK> that the <UNK> minute version is the full version br br finally sitting down to see the film last night i'm of mixed emotions about the film first and foremost its visually linked to every film that followed you can see every other of <UNK> remaining six films reflected in this movie down to the painted <UNK> its a striking film in its use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to a film stock he would he happy with of course there are failed projects as well the film is a visual work of art though be warned if you're going to see this on your widescreen tv this was shot 1 33 so will appear in normal tv ratio the rest of the film is a mixed bag part of the problem is that the lives of all of these people don't quite come together as separate tales they all work well but as a <UNK> whole they don't hang as one i don't blame <UNK> since one can't always hit things out of the box especially when some one like robert altman who <UNK> in multi character films of this sort occasionally bombed himself br br this isn't to say that there aren't reasons to see the film as will all <UNK> films there are always reasons to see his films whether they work or not the first trip of the <UNK> is one of the best things <UNK> ever did and is worth the price of a rental its one of the most magical moments in film history as the <UNK> is <UNK> and taken out the father and son living in the car is touching though ultimately very sad and there are other bits and pieces that shine like the cast which is across the board great and one should at least try the film as something different from a man we usually associated with samurai films or crime dramas br br its an intriguing misfire from a master filmmaker which means in this case means its better than most other filmmakers <UNK> br br between 6 and 7 as a whole much higher in pieces
<START> <UNK> 2 is the ill <UNK> sequel to the george romero's overrated original <UNK> any sequel following a romero film that's not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill mostly because of the romero fans out there who think he's god i didn't care much for the first film and funny enough i didn't care much for the sequel the film series had so much potential but it was short lived because both films were less than stellar br br the biggest problem with <UNK> 2 was that it only had three stories <UNK> the in between story and because the first story sucked beyond belief it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be really good i saw <UNK> 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real <UNK> anything dramatic with george 'i can't <UNK> kennedy is automatically doomed and the indian statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel so after a really trite and dull start there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the <UNK> beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story the raft and the <UNK> are moderately successful moderately because though the two other segments have their moments they still sorta fall flat the two last stories are basically stretched out for too long it's not that i wanted the stories to happen at a <UNK> pace and end fast but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta <UNK> by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more <UNK> more <UNK> and with <UNK> endings also if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch having only three padded segments made for a boring feast br br the acting and writing in both the raft and the <UNK> segments are from awful to good i like lois <UNK> in the last segment it's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as bond girl holly <UNK> in <UNK> and in death on the <UNK> but even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the <UNK> direction and the <UNK> story are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying <UNK> if the <UNK> body was found by other people on the road what was he when he attacked <UNK> was he a ghost or a zombie or what how did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack <UNK> the whole thing is not very clear even for a supernatural story and the ending is rather dull and <UNK> br br as for the infamous the raft story well the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting the characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves none of the actors are convincing in their specific roles paul <UNK> looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut she seems too <UNK> the same could be said with the two others who play the plain teens the idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed there should have been a fifth character to the story maybe a homeless man or a ranger who <UNK> around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the <UNK> <UNK> alter ego of sorts as creepy as the oil slick is it doesn't make for a compelling character and the way the story ends everything seems pointless no punch to it whatsoever br br except for the few <UNK> aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile seeing <UNK> 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time <UNK> 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen
<START> follow up to <UNK> walking tall continues the real life drama surrounding <UNK> sheriff <UNK> <UNK> but this installment plays like a lame tv movie bo <UNK> takes over the lead role from joe don baker but he's much too mild for the part he comes off like an <UNK> country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard <UNK> luke <UNK> and robert <UNK> end up with very little to do i would give the film one star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine <UNK> and the production is <UNK> followed in 1977 by final chapter walking tall and in 1978 by the television film a real american hero
<START> i wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most <UNK> sensation to hit broadway in many many years he's an academy award winning director yes he won for <UNK> you moron jeremy <UNK> is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky <UNK> he has experience with musicals really oh what a lovely war have you forgotten to answer your question yes the film is a disappointment clear and simple not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy <UNK> of the proceedings every character <UNK> beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical i felt nothing but when i saw it on stage i felt everything the film should have been cast with stars unknown <UNK> but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group great actors who could dance beautifully well michael douglas was in it true i forgot i'm absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical
<START> but watch mary <UNK> performance closely her body language her fine body movements her subtle but <UNK> effective reactions this is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft and the rest of the cast were pretty damned good too o br br this is perhaps the 3rd or 4th viewing for me and i see more in it each time what is this world coming to anyway r
<START> the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with <UNK> text from the bible the part that samuel jackson <UNK> to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane <UNK> and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple here's why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch br br 1 you don't know what's going on br br 2 there are barely any fights br br 3 the fights that are there are short and terribly filmed br br sonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious it's only for them that i give the bodyguard a 2nd star out of 10 this movie makes <UNK> minutes feel like 5 hours
<START> i was 5 years old when i saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in st thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it 27 years later it is still an original inspiration for <UNK> my goals that i have set to accomplish since that time br br this tragic story of a hard core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry during the late 50's <UNK> successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun this story could simply become the <UNK> story of many young aspiring artists about what could <UNK> when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand br br the phenomenal music written and composed by <UNK> franklin and curtis <UNK> the soundtrack carries the plot with every song from being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long term decision making to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead all three young girls <UNK> sister and <UNK> represent the different <UNK> that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society br br this movie could have possibly <UNK> the ideas of creating <UNK> on broadway and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 25 years later as an original audience member of both productions i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to <UNK> as well as in saturday night fever fame <UNK> and the off broadway smash hit mama i want to sing
<START> i'll take you there tells of a <UNK> man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date unlike most romantic comedies this little indie is mostly tongue in cheek <UNK> comedy featuring rogers and <UNK> with little emphasis on romance a sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving stays fresh and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers
<START> three stooges have rocket will travel 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad it makes the three stooges go around the world in a <UNK> from 1963 look like a masterpiece br br the stooges are <UNK> at a rocket place they climb into a rocket and it goes to <UNK> they meet some stuff there including a talking <UNK> they call <UNK> which they bring back to earth with them <UNK> speaks like an average pleasant person <UNK> hello how are you lovely planet here hope you like it ' hilarious br br very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on br br the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over br br high point of the film the end where the stooges sing a <UNK> little song about their journey the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two <UNK> brutal br br another writer mentioned the fine musical score huh the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes i'll take romance and there goes that song again both of which are played at the party and that really is the high point of the picture music from old columbia films br br the tall sexy blonde was nice br br awful a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store
<START> this film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years it is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary not contrived but very real it is very interesting and unsettling
<START> normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film and as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i <UNK> if i were you br br its also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim <UNK> <UNK> i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of <UNK> people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who <UNK> as much as the <UNK> in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once br br 2 10 avoid unless you enjoy tedium
<START> a simple comment br br what can i say this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made with a great cast jack lemmon and walter matthau <UNK> a perfect script by neil simon based on his play br br it is real to life situation done perfectly if you have digital cable one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on it usually gives this film stars but in reality it deserves stars if you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now
<START> it looks like the brilliant team of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the writing of this one somewhere <UNK> maybe to the <UNK> <UNK> reminds me any one of the many tedious promising at first but predictable within 1 season david kelly flicks <UNK> <UNK> ally <UNK> and now boston legal the crazy cases they get are so outlandish they barely evoke sympathy or sadness and that's what actually makes good medical dramas <UNK> dramatic situations you are afraid of this could be me sentiment they are not funny either br br the actors are quite good but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live i'm a <UNK> and let me tell you amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whoever writes her stuff <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> counter <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> somebody should give them a code of <UNK> to read the episode with the nose bleeding wife and the <UNK> involvement in it no <UNK> are that bad br br women yearning for men who have moved on had been done to death we've all <UNK> sex and the city <UNK> in her youthful <UNK> towards the guy she likes very age inappropriate looks so unnatural on a woman over 40 and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well the only successful <UNK> developments are <UNK> struggling with her decision to move to la and the voodoo dr and his <UNK> with <UNK> br br this concept might work with a whole new writing team
<START> ok so the oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year and i was rooting for <UNK> park to win come on robert altman had deserved an oscar for years that said i guess that it was high time for an african american to win best actress contrary to the previous reviewer <UNK> <UNK> role in <UNK> ball was far more original than nicole <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> i never would have thought to <UNK> the latter for anything especially in a year that saw <UNK> dr br br among the things that i had predicted was the stuff about the september 11 attacks i knew that they were going to say something about freedom yeah yeah robert redford should know better but contrary again to the previous reviewer whoopi goldberg is not the worst host among the past <UNK> was bob hope for whom i have no respect i really liked her <UNK> at john <UNK> br br so although i wouldn't have given a beautiful mind best picture the <UNK> <UNK> academy awards still pleased me i have to admit i enjoy the oscars more than my own birthday and the day after as my parents and i were <UNK> around the <UNK> in <UNK> new mexico it was spring break i was thinking to myself that when jim <UNK> won his oscar that most people watching were asking jim who i wonder whether or not woody allen will ever attend the oscars again
<START> what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money revenge can corrupt your soul or something like that guy ritchie a director known for his <UNK> of the gangster genre bites off more than he can chew with this one br br his use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by <UNK> his pride being nice to his enemy giving away all his money falls flat on it's face when jason <UNK> character no longer fears ray liotta it apparently drives liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene why basically you cannot set up a <UNK> like the liotta character who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a <UNK> smile on the face of <UNK> character br br before anyone starts to say i'm missing the point i'm not i get it ok <UNK> out of the quest for <UNK> you'll find true happiness and inner peace be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self destruction this seems to be the <UNK> of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story although hardly original the problem is that ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off at the moment when even guy ritchie realises this he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red herrings the scene when <UNK> gets knocked over by a car why the shooting of some scenes as marvel comic animations again why br br there are so many loose threads unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001 ish about it and try <UNK> them out or simply accept that there are no answers each viewer will interpret things in their own way myself i was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that i simply didn't care frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that i didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious <UNK> br br a waste of two hours of my life
<START> rated r for strong language violent content and some nudity <UNK> rating 13 canadian home video rating <UNK> br br fear of a black hat is one of the funniest most original comedies i have ever seen its basically a <UNK> rap version of the film this is spinal tap its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film if you manage to find this film anywhere don't hesitate to buy it even if you don't like rap music there are not too many comedy films that i give a perfect 10 10 to the only ones i can think of at the moment are this film <UNK> the world according to <UNK> the 40 year old virgin and chasing amy this film is a hilarious stereotype of the <UNK> rap culture the movie is about a woman named nina <UNK> who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group n w h n z with hats they are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a <UNK> fear of a black hat is an excellent comedic film and i recommend it even if you are not a fan of the <UNK> rap scene its a shame this film is not in the top 250 br br runtime <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> this movie was beautiful it was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can <UNK> is there wasn't a ton of details however this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph smith's life <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time
<START> it's a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals like an animal documentary and making pierce brosnan an indian make you wonder <UNK> all those people don't recognize if someone isn't indian at plain sight '
<START> brilliant actor as he is al pacino completely <UNK> revolution ¬ñ his method acting approach is totally ill suited to the role of an illiterate <UNK> caught up in the american war of independence much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson yes the man who made <UNK> of fire just a couple of years earlier ¬ñ talk about a come down one of the many jobs of a director is to <UNK> the actors <UNK> believable performances from them but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind it's not just <UNK> career low performance that <UNK> the film though there are numerous other flaws with revolution more of which will be said later br br illiterate <UNK> tom <UNK> al pacino lives in the north eastern region of america with his son ned sid owen <UNK> <UNK> he leads a simple life ¬ñ living off the land raising his son surviving against the elements the country is <UNK> over by the english <UNK> but during an eight year period <UNK> <UNK> a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born <UNK> gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are <UNK> by the <UNK> army ¬ñ swept away by events they can barely understand the <UNK> finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another tom also falls in love with daisy <UNK> <UNK> kinski a beautiful and fiery woman of british <UNK> <UNK> their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting br br where to start with the film's flaws most key actors are miscast ¬ñ pacino has been <UNK> enough already but kinski <UNK> little better as the <UNK> aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a <UNK> <UNK> accent robert <UNK> script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop or an epic war film with a handful of <UNK> drawn characters used to carry the story along as a result the narrative falls into no man's land <UNK> from grand spectacle to small story <UNK> and <UNK> john <UNK> score is quite ghastly and is <UNK> over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety hugh <UNK> direction is clumsy throughout both in his <UNK> of pacino and the other key actors and in the decision to use <UNK> shaky camera work during the action sequences the idea of the hand held camera is to create <UNK> ¬ñ that feeling of being there in the confusion of battle and <UNK> fire like so many other things in the film it doesn't work the one department where the film <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> is the period detail with costumes sets and <UNK> that look consistently accurate but if it's period detail you're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesn't even begin to make the grade nothing more than a <UNK> 000 000 mega bomb that the <UNK> british film industry could ill afford in the mid 1980s
<START> shakespeare's plays have a way of <UNK> time the language somehow breaks the time <UNK> but perhaps it is the actors who really do that br br after the disappointment in romeo and juliet the version with claire danes and <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was great br br <UNK> character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even <UNK> <UNK> is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the <UNK> to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that <UNK> performance here was really good as well br br i recommend this for shakespeare <UNK> and lazy students who refuse to read the book alike
<START> a damsel in distress is definitely not one of fred <UNK> better musicals but even <UNK> bad films always had some good moments br br in damsel astaire is jerry <UNK> an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour he meets lady alice <UNK> 19 year old joan fontaine a beautiful english <UNK> who <UNK> into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of <UNK> br br jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt he tries to rescue her from her family's country <UNK> house but soon discovers that the house staff is laying <UNK> on which <UNK> lady alice will marry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the conniving butler and albert harry watson the <UNK> house boy each take turns alternately helping and <UNK> lady <UNK> romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet br br this musical has numerous problems first there is the plot based on a novel by p g <UNK> who co wrote the screenplay the story is slow painful and nerve grating when fred is not dancing we have to endure endless annoying scenes of a fred <UNK> joan fontaine or b <UNK> and albert conniving against them and each other br br the butler and the house boy are especially irritating they are one dimensional stock villain characters the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance br br astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner ginger rogers joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film and is miscast in a musical she has little going for her character wise other than her lovely face and beautiful smile br br george burns and <UNK> allen are along for the ride as <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> secretary the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot and <UNK> has some funny lines but she is also very annoying at times br br the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done at times the cinematography is horrible and off focus there are a number of <UNK> scenes set on extremely <UNK> streets to try to convince the audience that we are in london not hollywood they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie on the plus side the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific and have become classic song standards and of course the dancing in the movie is exceptional thanks to astaire and his choreographer <UNK> pan br br but the musical and dance numbers are ill used and ill staged at times the cast seems to start singing and dancing because well it's time for them to start singing and dancing the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot at one point the butler steps outside the <UNK> house and breaks into an <UNK> solo for no clear reason the numbers include <UNK> i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now fred dances well on a <UNK> traffic filled london street he does some great <UNK> <UNK> with a rolled <UNK> but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double <UNK> bus in the broadway musical crazy for you harry <UNK> did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls br br <UNK> put me to the test fred george and <UNK> do a trio tap dance in an english <UNK> george and <UNK> match fred step for step but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason br br <UNK> stiff upper lip the fun house number at an amusement park fun house fred george and <UNK> have fun dancing on the revolving floor <UNK> barrel and with the fun house mirrors it's the best number of the movie but it gets a little <UNK> at times br br <UNK> things are looking up fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film <UNK> around the back woods of the country <UNK> estate fortunately it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer br br <UNK> a <UNK> day in london town fred wanders around the <UNK> <UNK> estate at night <UNK> about the <UNK> day when he first met joan in london at times he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog much like the musical number itself br br <UNK> nice work if you can get it a great song that is <UNK> in the movie during a social event at the <UNK> house fred gets drawn into a chorus of <UNK> faced singers who are <UNK> singing this song each time fred joins in the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave again harry <UNK> did a better dance number with this song in crazy for you <UNK> drum dance number as fred and joan are <UNK> fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while <UNK> a group of drums as usual it's a great dance number but there's absolutely no need for it except to <UNK> the movie br br the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine as he leaps from the balcony he finds a conveniently placed <UNK> that's right a <UNK> hanging from a nearby tree fred or rather a <UNK> in <UNK> clothes grabs the <UNK> and <UNK> to the ground from it br br the movie is worth <UNK> on dvd for the dance numbers alone but you feel <UNK> to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote the <UNK> button allows you to skip through the other boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers
<START> i must <UNK> this by saying i am a huge romantic hence i really wanted to like this film so i'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment i felt watching it the leap years tells the destiny filled tale of li ann who falls for the suave jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year a very romantic premise based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching yet another jack neo flick then why oh why is it so bad firstly i feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages predictable actions and clich√©d lines i am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in <UNK> to watch the leap years but those of us in the cinema would agree that our <UNK> <UNK> at the cringe worthy performances spoke volumes my hope was to watch a romantic movie that would <UNK> forever fever the best <UNK> romantic comedy so far and the leap years does not even come close some <UNK> have called it the crap years which is harsh but ultimately true don't waste your money or your emotions like i did the movie will make you give up on love forever
<START> it's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg crossing that twisted many people's minds and now god knows why she's in the game again basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the smash hit <UNK> basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct 2 is painful film making as the mediocre director michael <UNK> jones <UNK> the legacy of the first film br br the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine <UNK> sharon stone trying to look <UNK> sexy is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist a horrible david <UNK> is <UNK> to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction br br and there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy c class erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn off part of it because of the amateurish writing the <UNK> direction and <UNK> low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality a <UNK> a <UNK> scene was cut off so that this wouldn't be rated <UNK> 17 than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling torture br br to top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david <UNK> stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and <UNK> instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with <UNK> extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss you br br basic instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isn't some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david <UNK> dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this 3 10
<START> question how does a <UNK> director treat a subject like <UNK> answer by turning it into an existential alienation <UNK> br br yes we're back in the early 90s just after the <UNK> of the eastern block and the subsequent <UNK> of immigrants in the european union and what better way to deal with the subject than making a film about an <UNK> <UNK> middle class journalist an <UNK> <UNK> upper class politician his <UNK> <UNK> rich wife and so on br br in the background immigrants are asking for political asylum in an <UNK> greek village near the borders i guess that way <UNK> can show some social awareness while dealing with the <UNK> troubled upper classes i mean honestly the scene where some top <UNK> army officer <UNK> his destiny cause he sent his daughter to study in london is enough to make you <UNK> br br anyway it can't be that bad <UNK> is a master of the cinematic art after all right wrong it's at this point when his mannerisms start getting too artificial sort of like a <UNK> image in <UNK> his usual tricks show up there are <UNK> windows <UNK> lights a weird wedding a walk by the river shore and people with yellow water <UNK> also mastroianni breaks new ground for most <UNK> performance ever avoid really go for his early films
<START> i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to br br <UNK> a pros plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman <UNK> who want a child but can't i wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life take off from a real <UNK> life br br <UNK> appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her salman she cares for <UNK> and tries pushing her husband salman to <UNK> so they may have some romance when will the audience get fed up of <UNK> <UNK> br br though a good past time this movie is unbearable absurd
<START> i watched this movie with some curiosity i wanted to see if 1 paul muni could play chinese and 2 <UNK> rainer deserved her oscar i came away from the film thinking yes having seen muni in only one film where he was quite hammy i expected the same type of performance here i was happily proved wrong although some might criticize him as being too <UNK> and <UNK> simple in the hollywood idea of <UNK> i thought he was just right in the role <UNK> luke if he'd been given the chance to play a lead role might have played him in much the same manner br br i was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes especially during the <UNK> of the palace where o <UNK> was once a slave the graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the <UNK> made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all <UNK> and <UNK> i watched this film from beginning to end enthralled i can't say the same for the epics of today
<START> most action films are crass of hindi cinema especially of sunny and his family br br the film is typical sunny type with <UNK> big dialogues and melodrama br br the film also has typical <UNK> <UNK> ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain br br the starting is okay and then the shift to <UNK> is good but then the film goes on and on br br the sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens br br they are many stupid scenes like the <UNK> policemen are shown like <UNK> especially <UNK> br br the climax too is prolonged br br <UNK> <UNK> does an okay job music is okay only 1 song works and that is the last <UNK> camera work is good br br sunny <UNK> is as usual <UNK> acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable <UNK> is alright <UNK> are pure wood <UNK> <UNK> is not even half as scary as he was in <UNK> the rest are okay
<START> i enjoyed this film very much many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have <UNK> when they go to school cinematography was average the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more <UNK> editing however was very neat and unusual br br the acting was also very good kim ha <UNK> usually played an innocent weak girl in the korean soap <UNK> but this time she plays a cute <UNK> very well <UNK> sang woo also plays his role very believable br br what i like the most about this film is the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale there was no such crap in this movie br br very funny and well done
<START> as the film opens two thugs kill another thug when the body is discovered and about to be <UNK> the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead he was also suffering from the <UNK> plague a very nasty and more <UNK> version of the <UNK> plague so it's a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately otherwise a disaster could <UNK> br br oddly i actually know quite a bit about the <UNK> plague as i taught a series of <UNK> on it for my history classes the film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie the biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldn't have been allowed to show it sure there is high fever and <UNK> they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive <UNK> of <UNK> blood along with the enormously <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like you'd get with the <UNK> plague all <UNK> and gross i can certainly understand why they didn't go this far also i am sure that the federal government would have had a much much greater involvement in controlling and treating the disease here in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit dumb no one seemed willing to believe the doctors as for the acting the film had some excellent actors here richard widmark and paul douglas are respectively the public health doctor and police chief good actors but also known actors back in 1950 however in his first film is the very menacing jack palance still going by his original <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> as well as the relatively unknown at the time zero mostel palance was great very scary and very physically <UNK> in his own stunts mostel played a heavy typical of his early work a <UNK> and cowardly sort of evil br br overall despite really not getting the details right and <UNK> everything up a little too neatly the film is very tense and has excellent acting and is well worth seeing
<START> <UNK> last great film of the 1960's a <UNK> <UNK> with a great sense of purpose to his films <UNK> teamed up with <UNK> <UNK> of zatoichi fame to produce this <UNK> <UNK> of mindless <UNK> loyalty br br <UNK> heavenly judgment is the word that the <UNK> to the emperor yell while <UNK> enemies or <UNK> to the cause <UNK> plays up his <UNK> simple minded <UNK> to a manipulative politician all in the name of patriotic pride anybody who questions the politician is labeled a <UNK> and becomes an assassination target br br one of the best photographed films ever many shots are incredible compositions of form color and light the fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal the blood becomes a part of the color palette <UNK> uses for his images gorgeous and disturbing while the personal story is simple to follow the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this time in japan would be very helpful you can struggle through the film without it the few <UNK> to the film are the music track the length and <UNK> occasional scenery chewing he has a drunken scene that's way over the top for a film but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk br br downbeat but one of the great <UNK> films
<START> what a fun movie if you're a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner to begin with it's hard to go wrong with barbara <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the same giallo both are wonderful especially the wide eyed innocent <UNK> as the guilt ridden woman <UNK> for her life the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start the killer the red queen is one of the most over the top and interesting looking murderers i've seen in an italian movie the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film the convoluted plot held my interest throughout finally bruno <UNK> score may be the best i've heard from the composer the main theme is so memorable i haven't been able to get it out of my head for two days br br the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the film's finale first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot if you've seen more than a couple <UNK> you won't have any problem <UNK> who is behind the killings second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing i'm definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but i'll admit to being at a loss to explain it all a second viewing might just clear this up
<START> shocking br br in 1965 i saw jury <UNK> alive he was sincere <UNK> and kindly he was at ease and looked like well educated and intellectual person in this movie i saw a clown the actor looks like <UNK> with affected gestures and <UNK> they made a cartoon the real <UNK> was someone else don't believe in this movie br br i saw this movie after the movies like <UNK> of fire and apollo 13 and after reading books rockets and people by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and facts by <UNK> i was shocked by tiresome scenario poor acting and producing and a lots of <UNK> of space race br br the movie is the tedious rendering of well known in russia historical facts a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated some facts and details were perverted for example in 1945 <UNK> was already not a prisoner <UNK> in 1944 and in 1940 he was already not in <UNK> prison gold mine but in special prison design <UNK> <UNK> was the designer in prison design <UNK> and he was not buried the dead prisoners but in the movie <UNK> worked as grave <UNK> after 1940 because <UNK> have shoulder <UNK> on uniform imho the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies
<START> i caught this film at the <UNK> film festival i hadn't heard much about it only that it was a tightly paced thriller shot <UNK> on a very low budget i was hoping to catch the next big brit flick but i have to say i was severely disappointed this is not a love song follows two criminals who after accidentally shooting and killing a <UNK> young daughter become <UNK> in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down br br the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story as are the over the top performances and the appalling use of slow motion which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty which instead come over as hilarious and over the top cue a pathetic obligatory drug scene and countless pointless camera <UNK> no amount of <UNK> such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story br br we've seen this kind of thing many times before and made a hundred times better particularly in john <UNK> masterful deliverance but while in the latter film we actually cared about the characters in this film i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible even this wouldn't have been so bad if their <UNK> had been frightening or worthwhile but instead are merely a collection of stereotypical <UNK> looking <UNK> again another offensive <UNK> <UNK> coming to the <UNK> surely there are some nice people in the country filmmakers br br in its defense this is not a love song does contain a couple of good suspenseful moments but it's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video or at a push getting a very limited cinema release it's not a <UNK> on last year's low budget hunted in the hills movie dog soldiers maybe british cinema could actually get kick started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people
<START> wow all i can say is that if elizabeth <UNK> is the enemy she speaks russian then i'm <UNK> right now in her short <UNK> high top boots and <UNK> bust line she's a real babe even if her zombie like eye shadow sort of comes and goes this 30 minutes is no doubt the <UNK> of the series note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he <UNK> slugs her on the <UNK> ruining all the fun okay probably i should leave off my <UNK> response br br this is a very well produced half hour by that underrated force behind the <UNK> success buck <UNK> naturally the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry it's post nuclear holocaust america we know because she's part of the <UNK> force and only american bronson and soviet <UNK> are left along with about twenty tons of realistic <UNK> they wander among the destruction in <UNK> <UNK> while we wonder how long it will take for <UNK> to <UNK> politics which of course it eventually does lucky bronson and that's about it no real talk except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown nonetheless the screenplay is still entertaining and rather daring for its time even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers a popular cold war stereotype of the time br br in passing it's rather curious that the very <UNK> looking bronson <UNK> would be cast as the american and the glossy looking <UNK> as the <UNK> appearance wise it should be the reverse my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female regardless of appearances however that may be there is little of the usual <UNK> fright or atmosphere still the episode remains a very very watchable 30 minutes
<START> if you loved pulp fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film i liked the quirky story even though i feel that pulp fiction was the most over rated movie since the english patient and found the characters unrealistic but interesting it's not on the <UNK> or citizen kane and is <UNK> by european <UNK> but the worst part by far is the hand held camera it is so distracting and annoying i found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end i don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great if you are prone to motion sickness stay away the hand held camera will have you <UNK> in about 10 minutes
<START> it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is <UNK> bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff at this point i'm finished with my review but i have to fill in at least ten lines of text so i will go on <UNK> c <UNK> v it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is <UNK> bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff it is a piece of crap not funny at all during the whole movie nothing ever happens i almost fell asleep which in my case happens only if a movie is <UNK> bad that is why it didn't get 1 awful out of 10 but 2 don't be fooled like i was by first review a waste of money and your time spend it on other stuff
<START> i bet you gene simmons and vincent <UNK> <UNK> in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in isn't just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword and big <UNK> what the hell was that look at me i'm a rat double episode crap all that clich√© mafia banter come on the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a <UNK> <UNK> exit hmm this is not reality but staged drama mark <UNK> other show survivor also raised questions for me when johnny <UNK> stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born br br <UNK>
<START> after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie i was <UNK> of giving it a go but i had <UNK> 99 in my <UNK> thought id <UNK> on buying a budget like movie saw this and gave it ago i'm glad i did i enjoyed it directed by the star of films such as chain reaction the ring bourne identity brian cox i had to <UNK> with this even if it was rubbish but it weren't at all i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred <UNK> the star of spider man 2 the character doc <UNK> he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw <UNK> name and that made me get it and no his part isn't big at all it's very short at the very end of the film it's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film i suggest you give it a go some parts are a pit poor that needed <UNK> the acting and a bit more action but it's watchable
<START> what a crime br br you forgot to brush your teeth let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do br br but don't forget uncle joey has to make some weird noises and <UNK> faces then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some <UNK> and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody <UNK> how mother would have done things if she were around br br yep full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it br br full house will not only bore you to tears but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would
<START> i <UNK> seen the restored or any version for that matter of baby face with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm what a great movie in a nutshell lily lives in a <UNK> she's been <UNK> out by her own father since she was 14 then his still blows up and he's killed leaving lily stanwyck alone <UNK> for her black maid <UNK> played very nicely by <UNK> harris lily leaves for the big city new york deciding to use her sex to get to the top she does this in great style br br she <UNK> a <UNK> clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like <UNK> candy one <UNK> his fianc√©e and kills his near father in law also <UNK> sugar daddy then commits suicide lily barely <UNK> stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is br br then in paris she falls for <UNK> played by george brent they marry but when he's in deep financial <UNK> she <UNK> nearly free with <UNK> and a half million she realizes she loved court lily races to find him but will she be too late br br this is pre code hollywood at its best stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect this reminded me of original sin with angelina jolie another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman those who disliked that films ultra romantic <UNK> will not like baby face any better those with belief in sex love and power will love it highly recommended see it
<START> this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i can't get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the <UNK> who get things done and these four are excellent in their <UNK> some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we'd never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little <UNK> work you'll love this show it reminds me of <UNK> me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter react with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and that's what counts
<START> <UNK> luis <UNK> is told in prison about a perfect heist since he's behind bars and can't do it himself he has to leave it to his girl <UNK> patricia <UNK> soon there are five guys <UNK> the crime five guys with very little brain capacity brothers anthony and joe russo are the directors of welcome to <UNK> 2002 it's a crime comedy that's often very funny you can't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys there are some great actors playing these characters william h macy plays <UNK> <UNK> washington is leon sam <UNK> is <UNK> michael <UNK> is <UNK> andy <UNK> is basil <UNK> union plays his love interest michelle jennifer <UNK> plays <UNK> love interest <UNK> george clooney also producer plays <UNK> the <UNK> guy in a wheelchair this is a highly entertaining flick i certainly recommend it
<START> i had mixed feelings for les <UNK> 1974 written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> when i started watching it but i ended up liking it i would not call it vulgar dumb and dumber is vulgar the <UNK> thing is both vulgar and <UNK> stupid i would call it shocking and offensive i can understand why many viewers especially the females would not like or even hate it it is the epitome of <UNK> or so it seems and the way two <UNK> treat every woman they'd meet seems <UNK> but the more i think of it the more i realize that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem i am fascinated how <UNK> was able to get away with it the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable it is well written the acting by all is first class and the music is sweet and <UNK> actually when i think of it two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to they prepared a woman in the train the lovely <UNK> blonde <UNK> <UNK> who started her movie career with one of the most impressive <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> forbidden games <UNK> at age 6 for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months they found a man who was finally able to get a <UNK> marie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and satisfied they <UNK> and educated young and very willing isabelle <UNK> in one of her early screen appearances their encounter with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this comedy to the tragic level in short i am not sure i'd like to meet <UNK> <UNK> jean claude and patrick <UNK> <UNK> in real life and invite them over for dinner but i had a good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew it was never boring
<START> there's nothing new for me to say 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill the cast was stellar but unfortunately the producer director editor god <UNK> he should have eaten humble pie if not for his own sake then for the men who died in <UNK> hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors hired a real scriptwriter hired a real editor hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of apocalypse now on some cheap indian drug hired a real professional crew thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story unfortunately he like the <UNK> of the indian army made decisions that were terrible for his actors and terrible for his audience we all died over and over br br please don't do that again sir <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br ps next time an indian director decides to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> i suggest he hire more than one <UNK> to represent the team surely there are plenty of <UNK> men working in <UNK> last count was 40 000 to half a million
<START> i stopped watching this <UNK> as soon as the snakes started taking over the plane br br at first i thought maybe it should get a one for the comic relief but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more br br whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been <UNK> destroyed and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun the only thing snakes would do is <UNK> at the bottom of the <UNK> bay and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that br br this movie isn't worth a trip to blockbuster be warned if you pay for it the only victim is your dumb ass br br if you want to be really scared i suggest the descent if you want humor go to your local stand up comedy club their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash
<START> may the saints <UNK> us because this movie is not going to help br br someone with access needs to e mail mel gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of beowulf something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature br br the recent since 2000 versions of beowulf make we wonder two things first why is there so much interest in the story second why are all these filmmakers <UNK> mountains of cash on this crap br br the only reason this got a two is that the version with <UNK> in it beowulf 2000 was worse and needed the 1 br br what is even worse some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem how can an industry where peter jackson gets a literary <UNK> to film so right can get it so wrong i mean really the roman forum as a model for <UNK> is too much br br and please <UNK> on <UNK> spare me this is insulting br br <UNK>
<START> seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio zombi fulci might be up to his old tricks unfortunately other than the close ups of a rotting corpse there's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's quest to figure out who killed him none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it that twist at least was cool you stop caring the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert
<START> so they hyped the violence and it's been <UNK> as sick well the violence is the best bit i'm afraid but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their entirely predictable rampage this film has a truly dreadful script we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic the acting isn't much better either the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher the direction is clumsy the pace enough to send you to sleep and what on earth is the school film project all about a comment on the film itself perhaps the use of <UNK> during the climactic murder is laughable these guys obviously think they're <UNK> but are hopelessly out of their depth how on earth they got the great <UNK> <UNK> to light it i'll never know and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery absolutely awful beyond <UNK>
<START> barbra <UNK> first television special was simply fantastic from her skit as a child to her <UNK> of songs in a high fashion department store everything was top notch it was easy to understand how this special received awards br br not muddled down by guest appearances the focus remained on barbra <UNK> the entire production
<START> tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud the various moves with the <UNK> had to be learned as throwing <UNK> is a skill in and of itself br br there are a few surprises as cynical as we are today i fully expected the <UNK> <UNK> to be crying over his grave instead of his <UNK> especially with her remarks about <UNK> to the funeral of her best <UNK> when she first meets matt and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw <UNK> acid in mr allen's face <UNK> him interesting role by bruce dern <UNK> some of the other hollywood endings do happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully <UNK> that you're <UNK> unaware br br and the music is out of this world taking us back to the 50s when our <UNK> <UNK> were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo <UNK> even a little racism <UNK> its ugly head in chicago but at a club called wonderfully <UNK> with a <UNK> flag backing up the racist remarks i'll be watching it again just to hear the music good thing i have the <UNK> sound track so i can listen to that in the car watch both together and you'll see how matt has <UNK> playing bar room characters in both now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc he probably has great opportunity to do his studies great actor just coming into his own he shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters his <UNK> boy off the <UNK> is a great study made especially poignant because of his <UNK> <UNK> eyes he makes love convincingly as well since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen <UNK> i wonder how that it making love to an actress you kinda grew up with adds conviction i'll say that
<START> to anyone who might think this show isn't for them please give it a try network television has <UNK> into shows that are <UNK> of <UNK> or are reality based shows featuring some often unreal people this show is a return to family oriented tv where the emphasis is on learning some life lessons learning what real friends and family are about and maybe even learning a little bit about our national <UNK> jeremy <UNK> is one of the most appealing young actors in show business today and he is perfectly cast as the young slightly naive new <UNK> for the fictional new york <UNK> great name dean cain christopher lloyd <UNK> <UNK> and kirsten <UNK> round out the main cast and they are all exceptional this show deserves a chance to catch on and be seen hopefully it will stick around for a few seasons and we can watch pete young <UNK> character learn and grow
<START> michael is king this film contains some of the best stuff mike has ever done smooth criminal is pure genius the cameos are wonderful but as always the main event is <UNK> himself he is the best hands down
<START> strictly a routine by the numbers western directed by genre <UNK> andrew v mclaglen so is that any wonder army colonel brian keith <UNK> with smarmy <UNK> dean martin who has just kidnapped the <UNK> wife honor <UNK> who never found her <UNK> after playing <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> fist fights shoot outs <UNK> <UNK> and denver <UNK> in a supporting role in other words absolutely nothing new or original talking in a low <UNK> throughout keith gets to <UNK> with a prostitute something of a shock after his run on tv's family affair but otherwise this low rent material wastes <UNK> <UNK> talents it's also bad news for <UNK> who doesn't seem to notice or care hack direction poor writing and several unfunny attempts at <UNK> humor from
<START> i love a good war film and i fall into the been there done that category so i would like to think my review is an accurate one imho having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish there is no way i can recommend this film to you br br it started off with me shouting at the tv saying you wouldn't do that etc but i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a <UNK> so i <UNK> a bit but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud i was right br br there simply wasn't any logic to the <UNK> scenes i just know that the army team had some of the most patient <UNK> ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger so much so i was left scratching my head all the time then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the <UNK> are off out on their own driving around the desert one of the most valuable <UNK> in theatre out on a jolly <UNK> into some <UNK> wannabe <UNK> br br the sniper scene was just so laughable it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience it started with the contact right and went down hill fast if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the <UNK> team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all you are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet br br then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh another scene where you just wanted it to end it added nothing to the film br br then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched it <UNK> all logic and ability to write a good storyline it was senseless and awful i still don't understand why they wasted time on it then to watch him just <UNK> through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter pure comedy br br the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be i thought it was going to be stupid illogical <UNK> scenes but then it kept going off on <UNK> trying to be something different but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death all i wanted was for it to end it was a messy <UNK> of stupid scenes mixed into a <UNK> of stupid senseless action ish scenes br br there is no way i can recommend this maybe my work experience <UNK> the <UNK> but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense the only thing more stupid than this film is the <UNK> high imdb rating which must be the 24 7 work of the box office <UNK> team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good sorry folks it just ain't br br not recommended it will just bore you
<START> great acting great movie if you are thinking of building see this movie first the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt
<START> while leon is cute on snl he's only on for a minute like most snl skits to movies this one can't fill 90 minutes it has some cute moments the ones you've seen in the trailer but the actors are largely wasted tim meadows does his best but the plot just doesn't have many high points will farrell has a bit part farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie what a shame
<START> some spoilers as if you wouldn't know how it'll end br br my expectations for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and <UNK> <UNK> plus a very interesting theme <UNK> every premise for a great movie was accomplished unfortunately these things didn't matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awfully predictable br br it's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered <UNK> after the <UNK> on animals succeeded kevin bacon decides to test it on himself once he's invisible he changes completely realizing the <UNK> of not being seen from this to murder there's a very thin line br br hollow man is an ill movie it suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great <UNK> psychological thriller verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the fx are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but that's not enough to make a movie good actually that's the problem with the movies today just like verhoeven most directors care only about spectacular scenes and nothing more the exceptions are very few and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot br br after starship troopers verhoeven disappoints again in <UNK> of a great film <UNK> is <UNK> p there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1 the special effects 2 the joke with superman and wonder woman i won't spoil this moment for you br br okay so what went wrong with the movie everything let's see what i can remember br br it's not <UNK> at all it should've been but it's not br br it's too predictable you know from the beginning who will die and who will live br br in <UNK> of focusing on the psychological part verhoeven cares only about the effects br br very many cliches br br of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying br br just like in every low quality horror the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible every time there is somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for bacon br br some holes in the plot example at the beginning bacon has to <UNK> his finger to enter the lab after he's invisible how can he do that br br the ending absolutely horrible br br after <UNK> hits bacon in the head bacon falls down to the ground then <UNK> and <UNK> leave quietly and slowly without looking back is that normal then bacon gets up attacks them they kill him again and then <UNK> screams i heard an explosion happened minutes ago and they suddenly run inside didn't she hear that explosion some time before br br there's a scene in which you can see the <UNK> hanging above the actors come on mr verhoeven i expected much more from you br br so that's about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a <UNK> br br vote 4 out of 10 for the special effects
<START> ok <UNK> what i say br br the movie was excellent i am a huge nancy fan and i have read all 1 <UNK> original books and i went on to read more i am now on <UNK> beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have all clues point to a wonderful movie i loved the whole thing so what nancy is in current time she is still old fashioned like she is in the books people who haven't read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of nancy i have read all of them and i think emma is perfect and that nancy was perfect i found parts of the movie spooky i loved the exciting car chases and get <UNK> i loved the clues i solved the mystery myself it was really wonderful i suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of a what a good movie is and b about nancy drew go see it it may not be oscar worthy but its really a good movie
<START> spoilers like some evil <UNK> to <UNK> to chance double play combination we have in omen iv the evil seed of the deceased <UNK> <UNK> thorn come back <UNK> his parents his <UNK> his neighbors and finally the entire world as a she named <UNK> york asia <UNK> after being given to a deserving couple the <UNK> karen gene fay grant michael woods by the catholic <UNK> st francis <UNK> br br little <UNK> didn't waste any time making her <UNK> felt by scratching her mom at a house party later <UNK> almost get killed by a runaway truck only to have herself saved by this devil dog named <UNK> going to school <UNK> takes care of the local bully by getting the big guy to wet himself in front of all his classmates later when his father threatens the <UNK> with a law suit she has his head <UNK> off in a self induced traffic accident <UNK> is someone that you never mess with if you know what's good for you br br meanwhile <UNK> dad gene becomes a big man in town on his own or so he thinks by getting elected to the <UNK> as a champion of the clean air and green trees crowd instead of letting the <UNK> and <UNK> boys take over the neighborhood with his eye now on he white house itself did his <UNK> and strange daughter <UNK> have anything to do with gene <UNK> sudden good fortune br br it's only later when jo ann <UNK> is hired as <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> comes out about her strange and evil powers jo a new age type realizes that <UNK> is a bit weird after turning all her white <UNK> black and calls her new age guru <UNK> jim <UNK> to come over and check her out <UNK> is so upset by what he sees in <UNK> <UNK> color <UNK> all black and blue with a little <UNK> of red that it <UNK> him out so bad that he almost crashed into <UNK> <UNK> car br br taken on a trip to a psychic festival by jo <UNK> turns the entire event into an <UNK> setting the place through mental <UNK> on fire and <UNK> everyone there run for cover including poor <UNK> who was at the festival and ended up with his leg broken the and <UNK> and <UNK> guru was so <UNK> up by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a <UNK> in the <UNK> wilderness br br jo herself is later thrown out with the help of the sweet and <UNK> family pet <UNK> of a second floor window to her death because she knew and talked too much it's when karen is again pregnant that she decides finally to find out the truth about the real parents of <UNK> that's when she and we in the audience come face to face with the truth she's not only the feared <UNK> of revelations she's his twin sister her brother the <UNK> himself is about to come on the scene as her kid brother the <UNK> unborn alexander york br br three times were more then enough for the <UNK> coming back to earth to bring about <UNK> the movie going public were already getting a little tired of of him and his evil adventures with a fourth really not necessary since <UNK> thorn the original <UNK> had been dead and buried for years were put through the usual <UNK> with no one believing that little <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds of destroying the entire human race the movie as bad as it is is also far too long <UNK> minutes for a horror flick that could well have told it's story is as little as 80 minutes br br having a private eye earl knight <UNK> <UNK> and later a former catholic nun sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and now faith <UNK> <UNK> in the film only to be killed off didn't help the plot either it only prolonged the suffering of those of us watching the movie you could see the surprise ending coming almost as soon as the film omen iv began with the <UNK> being <UNK> for <UNK> eventual <UNK> of the <UNK> as well as <UNK> world what was a bit of a surprise was <UNK> doing it with a little help from friends
<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made even for a biker movie it's rock bottom the minimal plot involves a gang of <UNK> taking over a small town how original and the <UNK> attempts to fight them off why don't they call for outside help who knows the fight scenes are obviously fake adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there understandably this movie belongs in the trash heap
<START> the main reasons to see red eye are rachel mcadams who delivers a stellar performance and <UNK> <UNK> who is wonderful as the assistant hotel manager on the other hand cillian murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish the rest of the movie is <UNK> with plot holes on which i will elaborate br br please do not read further if you don't want to know what happens br br here is a synopsis of the plot rachel <UNK> character lisa manages a hotel where the new hard <UNK> <UNK> security director plans to stay that night rachel is returning to miami from a funeral but <UNK> calls from her assistant up until the plane leaves in the meantime someone is <UNK> outside the house of her father joe played by brian cox ready to kill him if cillian murphy jackson calls all lisa has to do is phone the hotel and move the director's <UNK> to one where jackson's <UNK> are planning to fire a guided missile from a fishing boat to kill the director and his family br br so here are some of the plot holes or absurd <UNK> br br 1 jackson finally convinces lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection lisa tries to fake that she is making the call but <UNK> a guy across the <UNK> from jackson is also making a call and starts <UNK> his phone to indicate it is dead jackson catches on and grabs the phone from lisa br br 2 at one point jackson head <UNK> lisa and she of course gets knocked out but only for 30 minutes br br 3 jackson catches lisa writing a note on the mirror in the extraordinarily large <UNK> and he <UNK> her around a bit miraculously the only one who hears anything is an 11 year old girl whose word of course is <UNK> br br 4 lisa stabs jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane is landing steals his cell phone and makes a mad dash for the exit fitting down the <UNK> between the seats and 18 <UNK> of standing passengers despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in his throat the flight <UNK> <UNK> lisa by opening the door to the jet way br br 5 ok all those are reasonable if not highly unlikely but here's where it gets really stupid lisa gets into the <UNK> at miami airport and there is no cell phone <UNK> every major airport in america has great cell phone reception br br 6 she runs through the airport with jackson in hot pursuit and no security officers even <UNK> them br br 7 jackson who lost lisa in the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the <UNK> has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat but he can still be somewhat understood however he doesn't bother to call his man outside of <UNK> house ps there is no train at miami airport but the one they showed looked an awful lot like the orlando airport br br 8 lisa steals a car and rides away of course this time when she goes to make a call the cell phone says low <UNK> and soon <UNK> off when will they stop using this inane plot device br br 9 while the phone still said low <UNK> lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window of the room on the <UNK> floor to which the director had been moved of course they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by ocean so the missile could have probably been launched at the first <UNK> thereby <UNK> the need for the whole lisa jackson plot what's the story here was the director's original room on the <UNK> floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view nevertheless everyone gets out just before the missile hits br br 10 lisa drives to <UNK> house to save her father only to see the killer outside although she runs him over as he is shooting at her by crashing her <UNK> into the house no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by br br 11 jackson arrives at <UNK> house and knocks him out we don't see how maybe another head butt he then explains to lisa that he didn't kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first give me a break what is this saturday morning cartoons br br 12 for the rest of the movie about 20 minutes jackson chases lisa around the house and she <UNK> fights him off of course a real killer i e one maybe played by jason <UNK> would have done away with lisa or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer in the first 30 seconds during the course of this chase jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill him br br 13 finally jackson <UNK> and he is about to kill lisa when you guessed it he is shot by joe br br so here's my suggestion tell wes craven to stick to horror or maybe he should get together with michael bay who directed the equally stupid the island and make red island
<START> <UNK> an all star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the mad mad mad mad world of horror pictures the sentinel 1977 is nevertheless an effectively creepy film <UNK> on the relatively unknown actress <UNK> raines in this one she plays a fashion model alison parker who moves into a brooklyn heights <UNK> that is and i don't think i'm giving away too much at this late date very close to the <UNK> of hell and as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than <UNK> <UNK> and the occasional water bug to put it mildly indeed the scene in which alison encounters her <UNK> upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water <UNK> down the <UNK> of most viewers despite many <UNK> complaints regarding <UNK> acting ability i thought she was just fine more than <UNK> holding her own in scenes with <UNK> <UNK> burgess meredith arthur kennedy chris sarandon and eli <UNK> the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained i was left feeling more than satisfied as the book dvd <UNK> puts it any movie with beverly <UNK> and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in <UNK> can't be all bad on a side note yesterday i walked over to 10 <UNK> <UNK> in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house yes it's still there and although <UNK> of its heavy coat of <UNK> and lacking a blind priest nun at the top floor window looks much the same as it did in this picture if this house really does sit <UNK> the entrance to hell i take it that hell is the brooklyn queens <UNK> but we new <UNK> have known that for some time
<START> if you want to know the real story of the wendigo i suggest you pick up a copy of <UNK> <UNK> original story this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the book br br i loved the book when i read it as a kid in <UNK> <UNK> by e m freeman and was so excited to see a movie based on it come out i was so disappointed when i finally saw it another thing is that there were too many pc politically correct undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film when the book was written pc didn't even exist br br my suggestion is don't waste your time or money if you see it on the video store shelf leave it there
<START> in the many films i have seen warren <UNK> i have come to a definite conclusion here is one talented individual i first saw mr <UNK> back in the 1960's television series called <UNK> burke from then on i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles that happened in 1974 when sam <UNK> gave him top billing in a film called <UNK> me the head of <UNK> garcia ' of course his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'the wild <UNK> i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic that is until i saw him in this flop the movie is called chandler a tribute to the iron <UNK> detectives of the 1950's created by raymond chandler because the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye i was immediately interested however i sat <UNK> through the entire film and found it to be a dull <UNK> interesting slow pace twisted confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self <UNK> and with some of hollywood's best supporting stars such as alex <UNK> mitch ryan gordon <UNK> charles <UNK> richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> this movie had enough power to reach <UNK> five however it <UNK> on the <UNK> and went no where as a result one of my favorite actor's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground
<START> joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man miles <UNK> who is played by herbert marshall mr marshall is quite good as miles miss fontaine acted her part to perfection she was at the same time cunning <UNK> innocent looking frightened and charming it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis <UNK> also in the film is <UNK> mother <UNK> fontaine as lady <UNK> i highly recommend this film
<START> i wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a comedy drama fantasy sci fi genre but given the actors involved i thought i'd give it a spin the tone of the film felt awkward going through <UNK> of each of the genres but never quite felt balanced so eventually i gave up trying and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances which i thought were good on the whole considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story won't give anything away here i have to say it felt a lot longer than its <UNK> minute runtime and not in a good way in the end i was looking for closure some measure of satisfaction but it didn't turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be i think tony <UNK> thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that but it was a tragic mistake to try and <UNK> the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion ultimately i feel cheated imo it would have been better to let it stand without the ending as a piece of art just or i may have missed the point completely
<START> <UNK> story another first time viewing for me and again this is one of the most popular of the <UNK> <UNK> and it's easy to see why though i realize how the film's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some i certainly <UNK> director peter <UNK> choice death and the maiden which incidentally is a classical piece by <UNK> that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode a great deal more though the <UNK> device itself is not all that great the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget <UNK> had to work with the latter <UNK> the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and frankly it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre though more so as not to be <UNK> rather than because he felt it was beneath him br br now to the individual stories themselves br br method for murder the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but to make up for this it's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times tom <UNK> <UNK> villain looking like the long lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house 1932 also it ends with a satisfactory <UNK> type twist and features a fairly intense role for <UNK> elliott in the lead that's all we need out of it really br br <UNK> for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film peter cushing and <UNK> <UNK> are both excellent as well as <UNK> dressed in their roles of two <UNK> lovers of a woman who continues to <UNK> them even after such a long time and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them <UNK> and <UNK> to a fate that is literally worse than death an ominous <UNK> scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand and <UNK> inexplicable inability or <UNK> to leave town somewhat recalls the house trapped <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> angel <UNK> br br <UNK> to the sweet this is perhaps the finest episode of all with his ambiguous role here christopher lee continues to demonstrate his <UNK> and he is matched by an understanding <UNK> dawn porter and the <UNK> innocence of chloe <UNK> who appears as lee's daughter the film's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling <UNK> trivia note chloe <UNK> appears as a grown up in the <UNK> included on the disc and when i saw her i felt an immediate <UNK> with her face but couldn't quite put my finger on it later on reading her filmography it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long running stage adaptation of agatha <UNK> the <UNK> in <UNK> west end which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of 2002 needless to say we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate and delicious portrayal in sheer evil mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a <UNK> smile br br the cloak a wacky but oddly <UNK> vampire tale that still manages to <UNK> many of the <UNK> attached to the <UNK> while <UNK> some new ones which takes in some wonderful <UNK> at exploitation cinema and at one point christopher lee himself jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he <UNK> for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat <UNK> to the proceedings geoffrey <UNK> made up to look like ernest <UNK> also has a <UNK> quirky bit the <UNK> <UNK> style of the ending was a pretty <UNK> one to pull on an audience i suppose and while some of the humor comes off as heavy handed <UNK> la the <UNK> vampire killers 1967 or theatre of blood 1973 it's also rather <UNK> and certainly ends the film on a high and highly unusual note br br video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory considering i had no other version to compare it with the main <UNK> is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one's enjoyment of the film as for the extras beginning with the audio commentary frankly this is one of the finest <UNK> about a genre film that i can remember listening to jonathan <UNK> gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a <UNK> but his effort certainly allows director peter <UNK> to touch on every aspect of the production whereas with some other films you're left rather expecting there to be more and as such it's an extremely pleasant track that <UNK> the main feature very nicely indeed the <UNK> a rated horror film is a worthwhile effort with peter <UNK> again at center stage but this time backed up with valid if all too brief <UNK> from producer max j <UNK> and stars chloe <UNK> ingrid pitt and geoffrey <UNK> we also get film notes reviews <UNK> and a poster stills gallery which again are wonderfully assembled with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty and a welcome one at that
<START> i've always been a big <UNK> <UNK> fan ever since i saw her series a few years ago this film certainly shows her in her best light yet the film was so wonderfully cast and played every now and again she drops little amusing lines just to make this film one of the best i've ever seen everybody really out does themselves especially robert downey jr and <UNK> <UNK> they really made the film come true also i loved the little bit where <UNK> loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor this is film at its best
<START> this is a truly awful b movie it is witless and often embarrassing the plot the basic making into show business routine is almost nonexistent in fact the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942 including the mills brothers count <UNK> duke <UNK> bob crosby and freddy slack each group gets about the standard three minutes the exception being the mills brothers who for some reason <UNK> two numbers ann miller doesn't get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film and she has little to do but <UNK> her stuff amid a <UNK> of patriotic propaganda br br the most interesting moment in the film in my view occurred in the duke <UNK> segment the band appears to be playing in a train standing in awkward positions in the deep south at the time the band was <UNK> in <UNK> cars when traveling johnny <UNK> is seen next to duke and harry <UNK> may also be identified in the last moments of the film <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> rushes down the <UNK> to the camera and does an uncle tom <UNK> his eyes and <UNK> his head the way willy best did in many films for modern viewers especially jazz fans this homage to <UNK> is sad indeed some movies go best unseen
<START> this movie had potential and i was willing to give it a try but there are so many <UNK> problems that are so obvious it's hard to swallow being treated like such an idiot br br rise to power is set in the late sixties carlito's way is set in the mid to late seventies for this movie to be realistic it would have to be set in the fifties if not the late forties br br rise to power has no sign of <UNK> <UNK> ann miller no sign of <UNK> no sign of <UNK> that carlito supposedly ran with in his hey day none of the primary characters in the original film were in this movie we're supposed to believe that carlito met all these people in the span of a few years br br rise to power ends with carlito walking down the beach talking about <UNK> in paradise which is what he wanted to do in the original film also the pre <UNK> creates the <UNK> and earl characters what's supposed to happen with them since they are clearly not in carlito's way it's also hard to understand how carlito could have the relationship with the italians he has in the original film watching the events of rise to power where are the <UNK> in this film there is probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison it's like trying to put a square plug into a round hole br br it is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some bucks by making an average gangster film and throwing a character called carlito <UNK> into the story the film had some good moments but i think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to carlito's way br br if you feel determined to see this movie the only advice i can give is to not think of the movie as a linear pre <UNK> think of it like the spaghetti westerns with clint eastwood's man with no name in other words two movies that have the same character but aren't necessarily connected with each other
<START> this video is 100 retarded besides the brain cell killing acting and plot it's way too long don't waste your money at the video store i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it just absolutely awful
<START> this movie has some fatal flaws in it how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the dr 's office is just bad writing or bad editing br br very very very predictable movie br br i am not sure how this film got made except it is was filmed in canada and probably received a government grant br br i must say the person playing aaron <UNK> <UNK> did a good job br br unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then i would say it will kill some time but otherwise it is a movie no actor would want on their resume
<START> a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker the fact is steven spielberg probably our greatest story <UNK> has been doing this in various movie <UNK> for years the color purple at the time was considered <UNK> especially after action classics like jaws and <UNK> of the lost <UNK> in <UNK> this film should have come as no surprise for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in e t critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare it is quite an entrance no special effects no <UNK> just brilliant story telling based on a literary classic by alice walker one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about african americans in the deep south slavery is gone but in the south depicted here it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves br br spielberg is always put down for <UNK> his pictures or adding an element of <UNK> to please the audience this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations it is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens empire of the sun always <UNK> list etc his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a he uses mostly <UNK> first time actors b he <UNK> a subject most felt was <UNK> to the screen and c it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years it is almost epic like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult br br whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured <UNK> an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover who she only knows as mister the film follows a path of occasional <UNK> and mental torture she goes through while with mister the pg 13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel this is not the burning bed in georgia by any means there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected it happens <UNK> goldberg perfectly plays a human being someone in need of love and someone who deserves it the <UNK> most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> are separated maybe forever possibly <UNK> holocaust <UNK> of child and parent you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence br br the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people there really is something to live for but love <UNK> over all spielberg <UNK> take note the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens br br rating 10 of 10
<START> this <UNK> sophisticated visual game presents <UNK> story within a <UNK> the protagonist is scriptwriter bart <UNK> who fights <UNK> with his new text ¬ñ which is at the same time the screenplay of the film we're watching in the movie bart plays a scriptwriter writing the script of the <UNK> <UNK> struggle with the text becomes a narrative theme as does the environment of the flat where he works and takes care of his little girl the intimate environment offers ample opportunity for games of illusion involving space light colours and a couple of cats the <UNK> simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable <UNK> of a text continually influenced by the <UNK> <UNK> which appears on a computer <UNK> and serves as a <UNK> to the similarity <UNK> environment the constantly changing viewing angle <UNK> answers to questions which <UNK> what is <UNK> and what <UNK> which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest can anything serve as a basic <UNK> point in the narrative space
<START> i've seen the <UNK> bait films and this is almost exactly the same thing as those a woman is sexually <UNK> by a group of <UNK> men and <UNK> <UNK> her vicious revenge on each of them the thing that sets this movie apart from those ones although not very far is that the sexual content is not <UNK> there is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film but not for a second is it ever sexy some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive but that's only because the movie is trying to <UNK> the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge br br this is a weak film it has no other way to maintain interest other than <UNK> our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her <UNK> i spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral but i was glad to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead it was not meant to pass off as a t a film br br b movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality and while i spit on you grave is <UNK> a b movie and contains more than its share of nudity the nudity does not drive the plot on the other hand the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of <UNK> these men are <UNK> drop outs just like they were in the <UNK> bait films and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless b movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind but instead it simply <UNK> the audience's desire to see a bunch of <UNK> get exactly what they deserve br br the one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks oddly the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity although not by much but it is by far the most painful to watch we are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the <UNK> on the boat and press his <UNK> against the <UNK> staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the <UNK> but again this movie <UNK> only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with br br spoilers you know that this is all the movie means to do since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed the woman does not live happily ever after she doesn't write her book she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place she just gets in the boat and <UNK> around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks but hey what more did you expect br br oh and did you read the <UNK> if you decide to waste your time watching this try and find any man getting broken or burned i was really looking forward to <UNK>
<START> you spend most of this two hour film wondering what's the story regarding the lead character br br will smith as a low key ben thomas will keep you guessing the last 20 25 minutes is when you find out and it's a shocker but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed until then smith plays it mysterious almost stalking people you know he has a good reason for doing it but it's never really explained once again to keep us guessing until the end br br all of it including a on again off again but touching romance with rosario <UNK> emily <UNK> might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film but don't because the final long segment puts all the pieces of this puzzle together br br this is a two hour film and not the typical action packed macho will smith film in fact the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn sad face of smith throughout this story it almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots he looks like he's lost weight and is sick smith does a great job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness br br like a good movie will often do this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits
<START> i had always been a big <UNK> carter wonder woman fan so when the sci fi channel ran this movie i had to see it i was <UNK> disappointed this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn't wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor man's james bond there's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e the <UNK> strength or determined will it's just one long bad dream i don't even think cathy is all that attractive anyway i wouldn't waste your time on this
<START> i have always been a huge james bond fanatic i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day and the world is not enough the <UNK> for everything or nothing are breathtaking the voice talents wow i love pierce brosnan he is finally bond in a video game he is bond i enjoyed the past bond games <UNK> the world is not enough agent under fire and <UNK> this one is definitely the best finally mr brosnan may i call him mr brosnan as a sign of respect yes i can he was <UNK> exciting to hear in a video game at long last duh i've seen him perform with robin williams and let me tell you they make a great team pierce brosnan is funny <UNK> handsome i mean to say <UNK> in a good way and just one of those actor's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug saying pierce brosnan thank you for being james bond if it wasn't for you i wouldn't know who james bond is he's a great actor i am a huge fan of willem dafoe even though i've seen him in a couple of movies his role as <UNK> <UNK> was brilliant did i spell the character's name right lol he does a great job with an accent sometimes i can't even hear an accent i have seen willem i mean mr dafoe perform in two movies finding <UNK> and spider man with my favorite actress kirsten dunst she rocks anyway he never <UNK> to <UNK> and richard <UNK> wow he's definitely got the part of <UNK> nailed i've seen him in the movie's and he's awesome as a matter of fact my <UNK> have met mr <UNK> and i was jealous when they told me but kirsten dunst is at the top of my list of <UNK> that i want to meet john <UNK> was breathtaking i have never seen a better person play as the <UNK> and gadget creating q mr <UNK> was hilarious i've seen him work with pierce brosnan in <UNK> and <UNK> never dies he's awesome john <UNK> most recent project is shrek 2 starring mike <UNK> cameron diaz julie <UNK> and eddie murphy shrek 2 is now in <UNK> good luck <UNK> oh yeah and as q <UNK> says grow up <UNK>
<START> i sometimes enjoy really lousy movies those that occasionally result when people even talented people get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster movies like attack of the killer tomatoes plan 9 from outer space <UNK> hands of fate and heavens gate etc br br so when i heard that this movie <UNK> attic was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade naturally i just had to see it br br boy do i regret that decision this movie is beyond bad it is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie the acting filming script etc are even worse than a low budget porno film the sound is utterly horrible the plot is completely incomprehensible the acting is laughable it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money at least the porno film has porno to break up the <UNK> while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy <UNK> a rotten apple and a mad <UNK> tea party br br the lighting is non existent many scenes take place in semi or complete darkness which is probably just as well the writer director i use the terms loosely david <UNK> tries to get kinky with bondage scenes but the results would be laughable if they weren't so pathetic there is some nudity but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual <UNK> i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film br br for the love of god avoid this train wreck i know that despite or perhaps because of my negative comments you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to be but trust me on this it's even worse than i have said and you will absolutely positively regret the experience and expense if you waste your money on a purchase or rental
<START> i rented the dubbed english version of <UNK> hoping that since it came from well known novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasn't much there br br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly <UNK> or otherwise <UNK> some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 star gate scene and the star wars image of <UNK> the robot on the <UNK> looked like an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesn't work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense it's superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually <UNK> to jar <UNK> annoying silliness br br the <UNK> details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the <UNK> was driving through the <UNK> middle of a field <UNK> <UNK> onto <UNK> <UNK> rather than working from one side to the other and <UNK> the <UNK> onto already <UNK> <UNK> or into a truck corn <UNK> was <UNK> out the grain <UNK> but the farm lands were drawn like a <UNK> field br br when it was time for <UNK> father had to face his fate there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the english language voice actor but the drawings didn't show much weight either <UNK> reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing br br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close <UNK> death is no spoiler his name isn't revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case there's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris br br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often <UNK> those failures with miserable deaths i can't say whether that's lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source possibly the <UNK> books br br there's a scene where a space ship crash lands as it <UNK> toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands br br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero there's a scene where she <UNK> like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over <UNK> death so quickly should at least be able to shout help it's got me and i can't reach my gun instead of just <UNK> br br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is d j bill he sounded like <UNK> jack the d j in american <UNK> i wonder if he's as well voiced in the original language br br two planets in the movie <UNK> the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death <UNK> primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the <UNK> explosions br br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from <UNK> is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that <UNK> the cheesy sounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy looking computer graphics br br finally there's the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a <UNK> boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and <UNK> a great power he doesn't understand he and his band of very <UNK> companions struggle against a powerful <UNK> evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is <UNK> and <UNK> enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but there's very little more than that in this movie br br in the end it's just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than that
<START> i've seen a lot of stupid <UNK> in my time but this one is among the worst after catching some disease in space an astronaut comes back to earth and starts melting he then goes on a rampage killing people how is beyond me i just watch them i can't explain them this is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place
<START> an <UNK> in <UNK> is one of a string of home runs bob <UNK> hit for wb in the early 1940s including <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> wins by a <UNK> ' <UNK> in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem it's basically the saga of a flea who's busy breaking ground for a new home and the dog whose ground is being broken because master elmer will give him a <UNK> flea bath if he so much as <UNK> the unlucky <UNK> is forced to endure an <UNK> spiral of torment as the <UNK> flea uses pick <UNK> and power tools to clear the land ' ultimately the little monster lights the <UNK> to a small mountain of high <UNK> he's <UNK> onto his <UNK> <UNK> there's a tremendous explosion and the hapless <UNK> covers his eyes as his rear end <UNK> in a blazing fourth of july display that really has to hurt and the dog takes flight but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile you guys better cut it out 'cause i think i'm starting to like it ' for years this kinky confession was <UNK> but current <UNK> have restored the clip so now viewers can enjoy it in its original <UNK> glory still cut however is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he <UNK> now i've seen everything ' this was a common gag at wb but it has since been <UNK> from this cartoon and several others including <UNK> '
<START> the only thing that the first power really has going for it is that it <UNK> jeff <UNK> an opportunity to play one of his lovely variety of psychotic villains that he's done so well in the last 25 years <UNK> is a worthy <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> in those parts back in the fifties br br but it's not enough the first power is a <UNK> up slasher flick that has lou diamond phillips wasted as an <UNK> detective who has a <UNK> in catching serial killers <UNK> is his latest catch but <UNK> in league with a lower power and they're going to team up and make <UNK> life miserable for him even after <UNK> is given the gas chamber his spirit comes back in all kinds of <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> is on hand as <UNK> partner who meets a nasty end involving a demon possessed horse and tracy griffith as a psychic and elizabeth <UNK> as a nun with insights are around to help lou will he succeed in battling forces from beyond br br by the time the film ends you no longer care lou really got trapped in a turkey maybe the devil made him do this film
<START> it's curious that the two stars of meet the people were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger <UNK> and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed <UNK> status on the small screen lucille ball however was not a major star that would come with television as for dick powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like meet the people and his career salvation would be coming in his next film br br i think the only reason that dick powell did the film was because a young player from mgm was cast in a <UNK> number and he was seeing her at the time his private time with june <UNK> was far better than what we see on the screen powell looks <UNK> bored and can't <UNK> up any kind of emotion at all br br he was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots the kind he ran from warner brothers from the original show meet the people was not a book show it was a <UNK> and it ran in the 1940 <UNK> season on broadway for <UNK> performances when mgm bought it they <UNK> everything but the title and the title song the rest of the score was <UNK> together from various and <UNK> <UNK> none of the songs is memorable odd when you consider some of the source material is from burton lane e y <UNK> harold <UNK> and <UNK> hart these guys just must have <UNK> the <UNK> for material br br the plot is <UNK> than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time powell is the writer of a <UNK> called meet the people and he's a <UNK> worker who wins a <UNK> date with movie star lucille ball she's interested he's interested they're both interested in the <UNK> but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale that's the film in a nutshell br br mgm did give powell and ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching meet the people the big bands of vaughn monroe and spike jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is bert <UNK> dressed in a <UNK> suit like lou <UNK> had in the dream sequence in in the navy the song <UNK> ho is written by <UNK> and <UNK> who wrote for <UNK> the courage number from the wizard of oz and as just about everyone in the world has seen that film you have an idea of <UNK> ho is like br br dick <UNK> next film was murder my sweet in which he finally <UNK> a not so fond <UNK> to musicals and lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do
<START> a series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day not as mind numbingly awful as say freddy got <UNK> or lost reality but that in no way is an <UNK> in any way sense or form features the worst <UNK> clown ever any most if it isn't offensive to anybody but the most <UNK> or politically correct it also has the worst song parody ever put on film the worst arnold <UNK> ever not just the worst put on film literally the worst ever i have no clue why karen black micheal clarke <UNK> or slash would star in this the reasons i watched this in the first place the only thing mildly amusing was <UNK> in conclusion i <UNK> recommend this film to anyone but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the bottom 250 on this site are pathetic do something notable with you lives people plus if it's true the church of <UNK> hates him he can't be all bad br br my grade d
<START> <UNK> is the story of teenage girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup <UNK> soccer match in <UNK> that may lead iran to the 2006 world cup in germany females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in iran although many of them dress like boys and sneak in stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course no girl gets in br br like most of <UNK> work his <UNK> <UNK> performance was superb you actually think that you are watching a documentary the dialogs between the girls and the <UNK> were executed <UNK> and astonishingly believable the film depicts the interactions between <UNK> and the <UNK> guards who themselves are serving <UNK> away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way at the end the audience realizes that there is not such a difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders
<START> this is another example of a <UNK> sequel to a great movie i highly recommend the prophecy but this movie was a dud from the start the acting was decent all the way around but the story line was weak and added nothing to the <UNK> a 4 out of 10 at best
<START> a truly muddled incomprehensible mess most things in the film look more or less like 1987 but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the <UNK> ray gun and that car the director seemed to be in love with colored lights the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie but since there was no cast listing i don't know which actress that was this one is worth missing grade f
<START> i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted that being the guy that played gary <UNK> and <UNK> role too bad the story was so boring not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary <UNK> before the movie so i didn't know what to expect i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was the whole movie was just talking talking and talking about their mom and dad the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper that was the only interest i got from this <UNK>
<START> i have to be 100 honest with you fellow imdb users i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster doesn't charlotte <UNK> looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way i'm in love with that woman i got what i expected but only half this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations br br while i don't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated i must admit that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> main has plenty of flaws br br my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters there isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment of romance or even a clue to suggest that they're interested in each other br br in fact the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward when both are in the couch and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest i didn't buy the dinner sequence br br still the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an <UNK> premise i mean with <UNK> that it would be very difficult to <UNK> such a <UNK> by a <UNK> year old man in these days br br i understand it's a movie and that's why i accept it as a funny situation plus the humor is versatile there are moments involving s m funny lines with <UNK> best friend some lesbian references funny situations involving the family women and more br br charlotte <UNK> performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie she's funny sexy looks very thin and fine and demonstrates she's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance br br <UNK> <UNK> is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance i think the supporting cast do what they can br br the score art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film br br those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits it's a good example of feel good cinema
<START> the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam <UNK> in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a <UNK> cake jealous br br i never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post so here's some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched
<START> i have not read the novel though i understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that i rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book having not read a single word of <UNK> writing i really can't compare this to any of her work what i can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and well delivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this this made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect british and verbal material every acting performance is spot on and paltrow completely nails the role of a kind <UNK> the characters are well written credible and consistent i did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while i think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated <UNK> and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared the editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous plot and pacing are great you're never bored it does end in a really obvious manner but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer i can't claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and i'd watch it again there is brief language in this i recommend this to any fan of romance stories 7 10
<START> deanna durbin then 14 and just under contract to mgm made a short feature in 1936 which paired her with judy garland a year younger in the first film for both of them louis b <UNK> then decided he didn't need two competing young singers placed his bet on garland and let durbin go universal immediately signed durbin rushed her into three smart girls and <UNK> the screenplay to <UNK> up her part she's billed last but with the <UNK> equivalent of <UNK> lights around her name universal was convinced durbin would be a smash and they were right three smart girls is less a musical and more a screwball comedy and durbin 15 when the movie was released carries it with <UNK> she's penny craig and she and her older sisters joan and kay are determined to save their father who had divorced their mother from the <UNK> of an elegant gold <UNK> with a fierce mother they talk their way from switzerland where they live to new york city where their father lives they plan not just to break up their father's wedding but to reunite their father with their mother who after ten years apart still loves the guy is there any doubt that durbin will sing a song or two in her warm <UNK> soprano nope is there any doubt the girls will succeed with kay and joan finding love and <UNK> material along the way nope again years later durbin was <UNK> as saying that she couldn't keep playing little miss <UNK> forever she was right of course but in three smart girls her first feature movie she has little miss <UNK> down pat durbin is funny determined <UNK> energetic and of all things natural her personality is so genuine that it makes this comedy a mix of farce confusion good intentions and cheerful <UNK> downright endearing br br durbin carries the movie with ease it's a lot of fun watching her hold her own against the likes of <UNK> barnes as donna <UNK> the woman with her <UNK> in <UNK> rich father played by charles <UNK> who was no <UNK> at stealing scenes either alice brady who played the <UNK> <UNK> in my man <UNK> plays donna <UNK> mother who is even more of a gold <UNK> than her daughter the last of the accomplished <UNK> is ray <UNK> as lord michael stuart who through a contrived and amusing mix up is mistaken for <UNK> <UNK> br br three smart girls holds up well as a light weight and amusing comedy of manners and mix ups so does deanna durbin as a brand new star who with her huge success saved <UNK> bacon
<START> i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob <UNK> seems to be so obsessed with <UNK> and <UNK> that it <UNK> the real story that i grew up with this is not a good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it what a waste of a perfectly good story if you read the book when you were younger and loved it then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly <UNK> it that it makes you angry buy your kids the book instead
<START> the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed it's funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort when battlestar <UNK> first came out i was really excited with the <UNK> of a better remake it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually <UNK> it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with <UNK> being a <UNK> god angel same with <UNK> and six was pretty dumb
<START> this movie is an exact copy of a tv series on indian television channel <UNK> which was aired at least 15 years ago the series was known as <UNK> meaning <UNK> each episode was a new short story the story is excellent and the original is much <UNK> and convincing <UNK> <UNK> does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a normal and third class guys as he calls himself in the movie in fact <UNK> <UNK> with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have <UNK> the <UNK> role but <UNK> just doesn't have the talent to pull it off br br i would suggest watching the series if it is available it is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction the acting of the tv actors was much better than these stars br br the only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour or 45 minutes story to 2 hours so it has to get <UNK> even the <UNK> singing <UNK> songs could not make up br br this movies is good for a lazy sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original tv serial the script and the ending of the serial was much better br br spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead spoilers ahead the ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself <UNK> the girl even thought she is willing to marry him he is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be <UNK> and never helped with that intention the director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film the original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys <UNK> in <UNK> the deliver just wasn't right br br but personally i feel this is a pathetic copy no credit should be given to the director scriptwriter the story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers <UNK> he class of <UNK> <UNK> i am not sure if this is <UNK> <UNK> story but many of the other short stories <UNK> he series feature a few of <UNK> <UNK> and other great hindi writers stories
<START> the 1963 version of the haunting has been one of my favorite horror films for years so i anticipated the release of this 1999 remake with a good deal of <UNK> it hardly seemed that any follow up could <UNK> or even equal the original masterpiece unfortunately my <UNK> were well <UNK> this movie stinks br br i don't know what the people involved in this film were thinking jan de <UNK> who seemed to have had a <UNK> when he directed the excellent speed does as poorly here or perhaps even worse as he did with the much hyped <UNK> <UNK> and speed 2 cruise control hey jan stick to cinematography would ya liam neeson is adequate in his role as the doctor pretending to be a sleep psychologist i don't think he is capable of turning in a truly bad performance but even he cannot save a lame script and weak story catherine zeta jones proves once again as she did in <UNK> that she lacks the acting ability to rise above the material that is handed to her the female lead who did great in an episode of the x files looks lost here as <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> on the edge of sanity and that blond guy whoever he is is more wooden than the laughably strange <UNK> of children <UNK> into the <UNK> around the house i don't think he changes expression once during the entire film br br spoilers ahead br br the reason the first movie worked so well is because we were never sure whether the house was truly haunted or whether the <UNK> were a result of <UNK> <UNK> mental state no spirits are actually seen in the original leaving much up to the imagination a hallmark of other great horror films like the <UNK> and the blair witch project in this updated version we of course get tons of cgi ghosts which basically in the face of the weak script plot make the movie totally <UNK> the f x aren't even that great considering they were done by <UNK> the frozen breath looks particularly fake the effects in the underrated peter jackson film the <UNK> which i saw just before this one were a lot better the wooden <UNK> of the children which are supposed to look creepy just look silly especially when they scream and the cgi monsters are nothing to write home about rather than providing a relief from the bad acting bad direction and bad writing the effects only add to this mess of a film br br some particularly dumb scenes when the three other characters break into <UNK> bedroom and none of them seem at all surprised to find a huge <UNK> demon <UNK> over the bed the scene where <UNK> sees the former lady of the house hanging from the <UNK> the acting here is particularly bad and last but not least the unintentionally hilarious bit where wooden blond guy <UNK> an uninspired shout of what is supposed to be anguish leaps up on a piece of furniture and starts <UNK> away at the painting of the old evil guy who built the house we actually get some satisfaction in this scene as seconds after his attack blond guy is dragged over to the <UNK> by the ghost of the old guy and promptly gets his head cut off by the <UNK> it was the only part of the movie i enjoyed br br in sum stick to the original 1963 the haunting 3 10 stars
<START> there are many reasons to watch this movie to see the reality that <UNK> latin america with regard to the <UNK> thing the police corruption at <UNK> level among so many realities that we live the <UNK> br br the performance of denzel <UNK> was brilliant this guy continues being an excellent actor and that it continues this way <UNK> fanning just by 10 years an excellent actress has become and i <UNK> her the rest of the movie was of marvel i have it in my collection br br i hope that they are happened to those producing of hollywood to make a movie completely in <UNK> where they show our reality better with regard to the <UNK> the traffic of drugs or the political problems they have been few the movies that they play <UNK> land for example <UNK> jungle 2 jungle <UNK> they should make more as well as they make in mexico br br the song <UNK> <UNK> i hope that it leaves in the soundtrack it is excellent my vote is 10 10

<START> i know sometimes its really really corny but the acting is amazing and melissa joan hart is as cute as a button i love this show a lot and i'm almost embarrassed that i do b c the show has a <UNK> for being really corny but it makes me feel good my only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it like <UNK> father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie i mean couldn't they just say he was an uncle or something still i can't help but loving this show harvey and sabrina make a really cute couple and <UNK> is absolutely hilarious i definitely recommend it if your looking for some light and funny entertainment my favorite episode is <UNK> madness a hilarious episode the best season is probably 3 i'm not really a fan of some of the seventh season twists once you get to college morgan joins the group and her dialog is painful and very poorly acted plus she is ugly so the jokes about how she is only surviving off her good looks were lost on me but i think it was set up to have a really good <UNK> season and i was really sad to see one of my favorite shows canceled
<START> poorly cast terrible script full of holes hot blonde gets eaten alive the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache one man takes on a platoon of trained <UNK> and comes out victor terrible special effects they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster awesome the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings haha good <UNK> up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners i highly enjoyed this movie but before you watch it make sure you're in for a good laugh i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious i can not in my right mind think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously however if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed very simply so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie it brought some joy into my life
<START> i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists the story is original and well written powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back then spots in the present <UNK> back and forth this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull bill paxton please make more horror movies you have the talent for it
<START> 1st watched 5 26 2002 4 out of 10 <UNK> michael <UNK> weird story about a <UNK> witch who tries to capture eternity by <UNK> her <UNK> body at least i think that was the relationship a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king's the shining the difference is that there was <UNK> in <UNK> performance that isn't at all in this film this is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one liners and attempts at <UNK> up the mood don't work at all the performances are not the problem here but the story is everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film there is a very small throwaway performance by christopher walken as the uncle of the <UNK> which of course gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the film don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film br br
<START> i rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie since i'm a big football fan boy was i wrong this movie is way too religious and preachy and is really unrealistic this movie pretty much says that if your a christian you can get anything you want in life easily like become a great football player you don't become a great football player by becoming christian and asking god you do it through practice and hard work all you gotta do is ask god and he'll give you anything <UNK> <UNK> thats not true at all duh i laughed several times because of this embarrassment the only part that was funny was when they were being dumb <UNK> the <UNK> no the dude that flew over the atlantic etc etc but really this movie wasn't that great i don't recommend it especially if you aren't a christian lol
<START> yes i'm going with the 1 0 on this and here's why in the last few years i have watched quite a few comedies and only left with a few mild laughs and a couple video rental late <UNK> because the movies were that easy to forget then i stumble upon nothing looked interesting wasn't expecting much though i was wrong this was probably one of the funniest movies i have ever had the chance to watch dave and andrew make a great comedic pair and the humor was catchy enough to remember but not over complex to the point of missing the joke i don't want to remark on any of the actual scenes because i do feel this is a movie worth seeing for once with more and more pointless concepts coming into movies you know like killer military <UNK> and fresh remakes that are ruining old classics this movie will make you happy to say it's ok to laugh at nothing
<START> when ben red foxx discovers his wife <UNK> pearl <UNK> has run off with his own brother he rushes to his son norman michael warren to <UNK> his tale of <UNK> only to discover that norman has a secret lover the <UNK> <UNK> dennis <UNK> needless to say ben does not take it well and numerous complications follow including ben's attempt to get norman over being homosexual by <UNK> him up with a hooker <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself br br originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam <UNK> norman is that you was an absolute disaster on the new york stage to give the play its due i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production and while no one would <UNK> it of being anything other than a shallow farce the cast played so <UNK> and in such drop dead manner that it proved quite amusing it is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same br br this is an <UNK> performed motion picture red foxx one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century is about as funny here as <UNK> wash michael warren who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect <UNK> with foxx to see who can give the worst performance and pearl <UNK> is not far behind truth be told only dennis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a cameo by <UNK> flowers have any spark and sadly that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast br br not only is the film badly performed it looks bad according to film <UNK> this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in <UNK> which was then <UNK> to celluloid for project purposes and believe me it shows the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted <UNK> seen through the windows of norman and <UNK> apartment br br some films are so bad that they become funny but norman is that you isn't one of them i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words miss it don't buy it don't rent it don't touch it with a ten foot pole just back away slowly and then run like hell br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> a dedicated fan to the <UNK> movies with the first one being a <UNK> and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced along comes this film now i'm not arguing with animation voice work music but this is no more than a timon pumbaa <UNK> in the <UNK> atmosphere although it isn't bad it doesn't add anything basically this movie is one big joke and that's about all that saves it make a real <UNK> disney the potential is there br br 4 10
<START> a delightful if somewhat predictable tv movie though i admit a little bias as far as i'm <UNK> the more gene wilder in this world the better i'd love to see numerous additional movies <UNK> the adventures of larry cash carter
<START> my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good <UNK> take off a killer <UNK> young people a white mask you get my drift we were dead wrong no pun intended we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it is a cult classic it is filled w plot holes and makes no sense the actress who plays <UNK> is pretty but that's about it i do give credit for it being shot on a very low budget i always support movies like that just not this particular one br br this movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high otherwise don't bother unless you want to lose your movie <UNK> like i did
<START> i don't think anyone besides <UNK> <UNK> and maybe <UNK> <UNK> hung makes cinema on a <UNK> level than claire denis that said i don't love this her <UNK> film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece trouble every day although it comes very close which itself is one of my absolute favorite films it it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too <UNK> for it's own good don't get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but i think denis took it about one degree <UNK> than it needed to go and consequently the film does <UNK> with <UNK> and a few key plot points should have been <UNK> somehow like that the main character goes to south korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for denis to use actors she likes yet again <UNK> <UNK> character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing it is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way at least as good as <UNK> more highly acclaimed beau <UNK> if not better claire denis has to be my favorite french director at this point better than <UNK> <UNK> even also i have to admit that the south korean sequence really does do lost in translation better than that film itself does and i unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well
<START> this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players it will make you laugh and it will make you cry the very end of the movie gets me to <UNK> up every time if you want to see a great movie this is it jimmy <UNK> supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> diversity of character is nothing short of amazing william tracy as <UNK> is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances felix <UNK> delivers a fantastic performance as <UNK> a stumbling bumbling shop worker who's life's ambition is to please those he works with it is a simple story of how close co workers can become and how two people who have great <UNK> towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances
<START> i've known about bettie page for many a year now the soft core porn images of her from the 1950's have since become <UNK> and still have a strong draw even today the bettie page look is also still hugely popular within the <UNK> fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then so i watched this film with quite a bit of <UNK> to begin with the result did not disappoint br br among other things it was hugely entertaining to see the movie's recreation of actual figures like irving <UNK> john willie and bunny <UNK> ¬ñ all consider <UNK> today mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual <UNK> and <UNK> in 1950's america along with a sexuality that by today's standards was innocent in the extreme i particularly liked the use of <UNK> versus color as a visual <UNK> for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself in br br i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter <UNK> bettie loved to look pretty loved the attention saw nothing wrong with nudity and enjoyed dressing up in silly outfits for the camera the underlying sexuality and deeply <UNK> desires all that <UNK> were completely lost on her to this day she still doesn't understand what all the fuss was about when it comes to her pictures or the s m content of them br br this isn't to say she's <UNK> or too simple to understand it's just that she simply doesn't get it about <UNK> and never will no harm there bettie page is simply being who she is the film captured this quite nicely br br the social atmosphere of the 1950's depicted by ms harron and written by her along with <UNK> turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do the <UNK> and <UNK> combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a <UNK> <UNK> world the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie <UNK> it all with her <UNK> faith and her <UNK> <UNK> br br this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms harron attempted and hit them well i'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture for those with such interests then this film is a must see
<START> i don't know why some people <UNK> that show so much br br it is a great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream prime time but still br br the family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent <UNK> roy <UNK> are only just above average but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing br br this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it br br rating 8 10
<START> if i had not read pat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before seeing this film i would have liked it <UNK> this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every angle br br the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working class area grabbed hold of my <UNK> and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears <UNK> shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldn't put down depressing yes but utterly gripping br br the film oh dear hollywood took <UNK> truth and reality and <UNK> a <UNK> of sweet <UNK> sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romance yes an adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> no br br the women of union street and their stories are <UNK> into <UNK> character their stories are touched on but many are <UNK> i accept that some of <UNK> tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the <UNK> described <UNK> of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a <UNK> <UNK> score br br if you enjoyed the film for its <UNK> and hope in the face of <UNK> i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like <UNK> <UNK> but without the happy ending
<START> first off let me say that i am a great believer in <UNK> stuff i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled star trek <UNK> and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts so i have a soft spot for <UNK> stuff that means i'll overlook things that i would <UNK> <UNK> badly br br so on to st <UNK> well first off the good things enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and for the most part the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles next the effects aren't bad for a home <UNK> effort with nothing to make you really <UNK> the stories aren't too bad either nothing particularly innovative but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story <UNK> br br but it has a lot of faults br br first off although they quite obviously have to rip off star trek footage set backdrops music and effects i see no reason why they <UNK> to rip off virtually every other sci fi musical score ever made everything from aliens to starship troopers <UNK> it <UNK> head at one point or another likewise much of the footage is from other movies <UNK> <UNK> over to make it look different the grey <UNK> for instance though disguised are quite obviously star <UNK> from star wars and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station <UNK> from starship troopers likewise sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters as does animated over footage in one scene in either first or second season i think you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any <UNK> br br acting <UNK> from the reasonable to the <UNK> painful to watch everyone does improve as the seasons progress though but expect to <UNK> at the screen a lot especially in the early seasons they've also made some interesting acting choices let's just say that the food <UNK> on this show seem <UNK> set to cake and leave it at that br br make up effects are generally quite effective on the whole but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap <UNK> and <UNK> masks for anything other than background use or passing shots they are just beyond unrealistic every time i saw one of these apart from trying not to laugh too much i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and <UNK> that this is a stick up in one scene a <UNK> actually talks whilst wearing one of these not only do the lips not move but the mask doesn't even have an opening where the mouth should be someone needs to be slapped hard for that couldn't they have taken a craft knife to it for <UNK> sake there are also some well done but unintentionally funny make up jobs such as the herman <UNK> look alike br br the writing though coherent is nothing new instead the script runs like a <UNK> of <UNK> with the ships heading out from <UNK> on various missions the new enemy the grey aren't very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a <UNK> of the <UNK> threads i e <UNK> meet the grey the grey are hugely powerful <UNK> barely escape with their lives then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc all done before with the <UNK> br br another bone of <UNK> is the dialogue star trek writers have long had the ability to write insert <UNK> here into a script it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using quantum phase <UNK> or <UNK> charges etc in other words nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand br br the words are just <UNK> really i've no problem with this but where st <UNK> makes a mess of it is where they include real world comments into this concept br br <UNK> advice such as we need to <UNK> sounds good but not when <UNK> by trio of characters already standing in a group likewise when asked what the situation is a <UNK> officer is heard to <UNK> we count three <UNK> he actually needed to count them c'mon i expected the <UNK> to ask him are you sure or can you double check but my all time favourite comment is this br br captain can we establish two way communication br br <UNK> officer no we can only send and receive br br well duh br br having said all the above the show does improve as it goes along seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad 3 shows an improvement but 4 5 are where it starts to get <UNK> better season 6 so far looks quite reasonable br br i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though <UNK> sucks quite frankly and the sooner they move to <UNK> <UNK> format the better some of us like to actually take our <UNK> shows and watch them on decent size screen and not <UNK> at a tiny <UNK> window on a computer <UNK> not only does <UNK> make this difficult but the <UNK> resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well in fact it makes the shows pretty unwatchable like they were a <UNK> generation vhs tape copy the least they could do was to include a hi <UNK> <UNK> option br br anyway the show has promise and i'm even beginning to like some of the characters but that's 40 episodes on so i'm not sure this says that much about character development at all br br but what can you say it's free br br ps out of 28 votes 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10 <UNK> were we watching the same show or are you 19 all three year olds
<START> taking over roles that jack <UNK> and sam <UNK> played on broadway walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles <UNK> who seem to have a <UNK> <UNK> on life br br walter matthau can't stop working the man has never learned to relax take some time and smell the <UNK> he's a <UNK> old <UNK> whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him br br what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to <UNK> and spend some time with his family a <UNK> like matthau can't comprehend it and take <UNK> decision personally br br benjamin hits on a brain storm reunite the guys and do it on a national television special what happens here is pretty hilarious br br the sunshine boys is also a sad bittersweet story as well about old age matthau is on screen for most of the film but it's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the <UNK> old age of <UNK> br br burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burns allen who the monty python <UNK> borrowed a lot from in 1958 due to health reasons <UNK> allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 or at least pretty close to as an active performer br br the sunshine boys is based on the team of smith <UNK> however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their material br br and i do think you will like the sunshine boys
<START> if at least the cruelty and drawn out deaths had a purpose to the story to justify their inclusion but the script was just <UNK> and just plain stupid br br it went nowhere the story had no <UNK> continuity it was just a bunch of drawn out pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid ending tacked on as if to say the end <UNK> you my <UNK> and my few <UNK> for watching my garbage br br i don't get it a masked murderer who never had his mask removed in prison a prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards <UNK> a a ugly <UNK> serial killer and getting killed by him and nothing else no explanation no punishment a really weak main cop character that was a waste of a actor like <UNK> who didn't try to off the guy who killed his cops tortured a baby a woman and a dog and sent them to you to watch on video br br cops who for some unknown reason all <UNK> off in the dark by themselves <UNK> in his farm house at night like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters to be killed one at a time like a bunch of idiots and no other cop hears them die in the darkness one after the other and just keep wandering around for no reason till each is killed in turn br br a bunch of horrible real life animal snuff scenes in the beginning for no reason or explanation was he <UNK> was he watching it to <UNK> was it comedy for him what was it nope boll just thought to throw it in to upset animal lovers whatever br br then <UNK> believing the word of a psycho path to let his family go if he kills himself a more <UNK> <UNK> cop you never saw in a film br br i <UNK> why i try not to totally hate his works i try to find some reason to explain a horror writers art but this stuff pure crap br br boll what are you doing anymore i hope you figure it out because i know a lot of more deserving people who can't dream to get the budget you get over and over again to make their movies br br if you want to see boll actually at his best check out <UNK> it was actually okay
<START> <UNK> is this embarrassing in fact here's a list of 100 that makes up the embarrassment 1 a failed comeback for christopher lloyd 2 jeff daniels basically playing the same role he played in the live 101 <UNK> remake which wasn't too <UNK> to begin with he sure has a funny way of promoting his purple rose theatre 3 <UNK> 4 another disappointing reminder that wallace shawn is to disney what jet li was to bob <UNK> in unleashed 5 ray <UNK> the original martian from the tv series played a bit part read cameo in this flick and died two years later of <UNK> coincidence 6 awful special effects seriously awful 7 100 that damn talking <UNK> suit voiced to an annoying degree by wayne knight newman my favorite scene ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha <UNK> good one you you're a joker okay let's wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this <UNK> <UNK> death and if you would like you can say a quick <UNK> that disney doesn't forget this travesty and do something silly like a movie adaptation of <UNK> and <UNK> starring tim allen
<START> i have very fond memories of this film as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown <UNK> in 1977 and i was eight years old apparently it was deemed a failure and is now practically forgotten the pan and <UNK> <UNK> which never did justice to the picture or it's ambitious <UNK> compositions is now out of print the film is very stylized shades of yellow submarine and admittedly uneven some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and <UNK> the sad <UNK> blue <UNK> shades of <UNK> and his blue song are truly heartwarming joe <UNK> songs are for the most part simply beautiful definitely a worthwhile <UNK> that will probably sadly fall into total obscurity
<START> i'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own there's lucy <UNK> i dream of <UNK> the one with barbara <UNK> and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead so for me the jane show is in pretty good company one thing i just thought of though i've watched several things made in canada and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow it's all made at the height of summer lol granted it's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that's part of the lifestyle there also i mean <UNK> just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of <UNK> shots i <UNK> but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and i like the bald guy and his <UNK> i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd i think another office comedy with a female lead not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it <UNK> sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch 7 of 10
<START> the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this 1999 remake it's a classic there is no character development here only caricatures the slut the <UNK> brain the i'm gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive <UNK> but seeing as how the were <UNK> on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doors irritating dead children that can't speak <UNK> and an <UNK> sappy ending that does it's <UNK> to give you a new age <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> ill take my <UNK> <UNK> thank you bruce dern i've liked you since the <UNK> stop it
<START> this is supposed to be well <UNK> and based on fact how come therefore that it's so packed with <UNK> did the people of <UNK> live in some kind of bizarre philip k dick world in which reality was <UNK> like cracker liam priest or is <UNK> an <UNK> hack who just keeps repeating <UNK>
<START> the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest <UNK> all i can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film as far as i could tell <UNK> was the only actor in it the other performances were so uniformly terrible i am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original <UNK> on the disney channel and similar kid focused networks but honestly that is not saying much
<START> farrah fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables gives james russo a taste of his own medicine a must see for any movie fan
<START> a winters day <UNK> december 1986 two bored 14 year olds hire a movie <UNK> police story looks interesting who is this jackie chan never heard of him two hours later after watching the film in a <UNK> we wanted to know more 16 years later and severely out of pocket from collecting <UNK> movies the film still grabs me like no other ok maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my first <UNK> run doesn't count <UNK> movie but it is an excellent movie it has all the classic <UNK> elements action humour action heart and action some comments say it's dated it was made in 1985 of course it's dated but then so must jaws casablanca <UNK> in the rain and the godfather without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today ps set standards many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen you miss so much of the movie otherwise yes he really does fall off the bus going round the corner if you haven't already see this movie now br br
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br jason a k a <UNK> <UNK> is a brilliant brain surgeon who along with wife virginia <UNK> is involved in the most lackluster <UNK> car crash ever <UNK> is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed <UNK> back to his mansion and <UNK> the head in his lab the <UNK> exterior was allegedly filmed at <UNK> <UNK> estate the lab scenes were apparently shot in <UNK> basement the <UNK> head is kept alive on lab equipment that's almost cheap looking enough for ed wood some of the library <UNK> movie's high <UNK> turned up in andy <UNK> the body beneath <UNK> head has some heavy <UNK> <UNK> with another of <UNK> <UNK> a mutant <UNK> in the closet meanwhile the good doc <UNK> strip <UNK> looking for a body worthy of his wife's <UNK> <UNK> the ending in uncut <UNK> features some ahead of its time splatter and <UNK> when the <UNK> headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close this thing took three years to be released and then audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved between this plan 9 from outer space and a few others 1959 should have been <UNK> the year of the turkey
<START> i'm glad that i saw this film after mr sandler became famous br br it is bad bad bad bad there is no plot it's like watching a painfully dull home movie br br i really enjoy his other films but if you're a fan like me stay away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this film i've had a better time watching old folks play <UNK> in a home
<START> well since seeing <UNK> 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds br br i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of <UNK> but without him around in this one it's just not the same sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story <UNK> but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part 4 even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again
<START> when i decided to watch the <UNK> starring those twin <UNK> peter and david paul i thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by <UNK> <UNK> who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well the <UNK> is remarkably trashy action adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian and fails at every level the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were well shot but the tone and the <UNK> tacky disco look of the clothes and hair people are <UNK> with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever even for a low budget flick like this one br br richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous <UNK> and costume he's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a <UNK> and it's funny to see eva <UNK> callahan one of the stars of all my children appear in her first movie walking around in skimpy fur bikini i'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth the so called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it's almost impossible to <UNK> a proper critique of their acting because their roles are like everything else in this mess really ill conceived the only way the film tries to <UNK> one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a <UNK> that covers his ass while the other <UNK> <UNK> barely covers his muscular butt i'm not kidding don't ask me who's who though br br <UNK> must have been really desperate to agree to make this film and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick it's just bad
<START> the only reason i came across this movie was that it's on the little miss <UNK> dvd and i do recommend watching it although you won't like it as well as the better known movie br br we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion the film starts out quite light but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to <UNK> a <UNK> amount of cash from his brother in law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother in law <UNK> to keep her however he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops br br cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she's in there's little music in this and shirley only has one song however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss <UNK>
<START> i'm irish and i've been living in <UNK> for a while so i was looking forward to going home last week so i could see <UNK> and i will go on record as saying br br this film is awful br br it is not quite as bad a something like the most <UNK> man in ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other irish films such as the <UNK> i went down or michael collins br br some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as <UNK> <UNK> american style <UNK> but the film itself is shot completely wrong the <UNK> around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama but it isn't this is an irish lock stock and two smoking <UNK> and it should be shot like this it should have smooth movement from one shot to the next the film just looks sloppy and thrown together br br the performances are okay given the awful script a friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed colin farrell around <UNK> for a week he gives a decent display as a <UNK> <UNK> but it no way <UNK> to his performances in minority report <UNK> or phone booth the best performance was from <UNK> <UNK> who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman i think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting br br all in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best irish films ever br br i'm expecting a <UNK> from these comments because most people i have spoken to have said it was great but before you <UNK> ask yourself would think so highly of this movie if it was set in england or america
<START> i gave it an 8 star rating the story may have fallen short about 3 4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout men of honor was changed from navy diver understandably so anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that honor is an appropriate word to use in the title
<START> when i first saw a cry in the dark i had no idea what the plot was but when i saw it i was shocked at what it portrayed when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class i realized a second point communication issues you see when a <UNK> <UNK> lindy <UNK> meryl streep baby she and her husband michael sam <UNK> were grief stricken but didn't show it as seventh day <UNK> they believed that god <UNK> this to happen and so they couldn't <UNK> it but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness everyone started believing that lindy did it herself br br the point is the wrong message got <UNK> to the public and it turned people against lindy even though this was a pure accident it still happened it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media regardless of any media <UNK> political views br br as for the performances streep does a very good job with an australian accent no surprise there and sam <UNK> is equally great you will probably get blown away just by what you see here definitely one of fred <UNK> best movies ever
<START> giving credit where it's due only the technicolor costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention br br this is undoubtedly the lowest point in bing <UNK> long career at paramount the script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual bing nor william <UNK> nor sir cedric <UNK> can do a thing about <UNK> it br br <UNK> looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig and poor <UNK> <UNK> has a stock costume heroine role <UNK> her to look <UNK> at bing and little else except for <UNK> a couple of uninspired <UNK> in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion br br just plain awful mark <UNK> wit is not evident in any of the screenplay only die hard crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction even the extras look as though they don't know what they're supposed to be doing br br <UNK> up dull as <UNK> not recommended even for children
<START> i have a high tolerance level for crap so i was looking forward to this it did not disappoint apparently based on sheridan le <UNK> classic <UNK> it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who luckily happens to be travelling with them then we have santa claus or the general as he likes to be called here running over random zombies did i mention there was a zombie <UNK> the dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned we have construction worker zombies soldier zombies and even st <UNK> <UNK> zombies apparently santa claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire oh wait there are no vampires the girl is in a lunatic asylum and <UNK> is her nurse or is she the zombies are back and <UNK> mad lesbian sex i like vampires and i like zombies but i especially like lesbian sex nothing like some <UNK> <UNK> to get the <UNK> flowing when are we going to see vampires fight zombies is she a vampire or is she a lunatic or both is <UNK> a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse more <UNK> you can never have enough <UNK> here come the st <UNK> zombies chainsaw time more lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires i guess the zombies won or did they plot who needs a plot when you've got lesbian vampires and <UNK> zombies and <UNK>
<START> let me just say i loved the original boogeyman sure it's a flawed clich√©d 80s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch and plus it gave us something a bit different so i gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it only copy they had actually so i thought eh what the hell and bought it mistake 1 so that night i felt in the mood to watch a movie i actually bought tons that day and figured this was the <UNK> out of all the ones i bought so i'll just watch this and hit the sack mistake 2 yes i have heard how bad it was but i was willing to take a chance br br so a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback i think nothing of it at first then the new footage with the <UNK> of the chick in the <UNK> and i'm kinda liking the direction it's going in then the next flashback which is a bit longer and i'm sitting there thinking yes i've seen the first boogeyman i know what happens so move along then the next one comes up and i figure screw it and fast forward through it then the final one maybe i fast <UNK> through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror at least she could've shown them and i decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over wtf what happened to the <UNK> stuff what happened to the long hair dude did he tap that or what and more importantly what kind of <UNK> was the writer and director smoking when making this awful <UNK> and what was the point was annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this the latter could make sense because the stabbing of <UNK> face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later wait a minute no it wouldn't because <UNK> who the movie <UNK> <UNK> nancy is <UNK> too dumb to remember his movie characters' names would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks <UNK> but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10 did she get around during middle school and also why would <UNK> be after annie what connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie and a big huge movie mistake i found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his <UNK> does anyone notice that he's just <UNK> wow how professional doc so what is the explanation for all of the questions i asked above it's a pointless movie with no thought put into it at all i will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it maybe a couple of extra features any special edition of it yet then i will return this dvd and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore please let that be so sorry this review is so long i'm just angry at this movie i had to <UNK> somehow
<START> <UNK> <UNK> wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on <UNK> in the years before the <UNK> of the hideous disease were it not for the <UNK> of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the <UNK> of the world by a rampant non <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific <UNK> about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the <UNK> in whom it was <UNK> he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by <UNK> of music from <UNK> opera <UNK> which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera a police investigator louise <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her companion cop <UNK> parker follow the murders while <UNK> makes the rounds of the sex <UNK> and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory he encounters a strange <UNK> jeffrey jim <UNK> with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor <UNK> richard <UNK> who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects how this all come to an end is the play of the film a story as much about the search for self identity between <UNK> and <UNK> as it is a case for investigation of murders br br while tom <UNK> jim <UNK> and richard <UNK> do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film the quality of the film <UNK> considerably by the less than acceptable <UNK> talented <UNK> levy and <UNK> parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero there are some small cameos by other actors that <UNK> the screen for the moments they inhabit but in all the film is drowned by the <UNK> replay of <UNK> <UNK> as sung by mario del <UNK> from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing grady <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the first of two films by johnny to this film won many awards but none so <UNK> as a cannes golden palm nomination br br the <UNK> <UNK> their leader but it is far from <UNK> with the behind the scenes <UNK> br br tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> train <UNK> of time <UNK> is big d who plans to take the <UNK> no matter what it takes even if it means a war well war is not going to happen as that is bad for business big d will change his tune or br br good performances by simon <UNK> louis <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> affairs i iii along with tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br whether <UNK> made men in the mafia or members of the <UNK> sing society the <UNK> are the same fascinating to watch br br to be continued
<START> winchester '73 marked the first of a series of westerns involving james stewart and director anthony mann as in most of them stewart's hero has an violent edge that threatens to explode at any time br br the title refers to a one in a thousand rifle that is up for competition at a rifle shoot held in dodge city on july 4 <UNK> into town comes lin <UNK> stewart and his sidekick high spade <UNK> mitchell who are on the trail of dutch henry brown stephen <UNK> for a past <UNK> deed they arrive just in time to see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> running saloon girl lola shelley winters out of town it turns out that dutch henry is also in town for the rifle shoot lin and dutch henry shoot it out for the <UNK> prize with lin winning but dutch henry <UNK> lin of the gun and escapes br br lin and high spade trail dutch henry across country where they encounter lola with her cowardly beau steve miller charles drake hold up in a u s <UNK> camp awaiting attack by the indians led by young bull rock hudson who has acquired the <UNK> rifle by murdering <UNK> gun runner john <UNK> he had got the weapon by cheating dutch henry at poker young bull is killed during the attack and the gun passes to steve br br meanwhile back at the ranch lola and steve meet up with notorious <UNK> <UNK> johnny dean dan duryea who kills steve and takes the <UNK> rifle and lola for himself when dean meets up with dutch henry he allows him to take back his gun planning to murder him later in the town of <UNK> lin kills dean as dutch <UNK> plans of holding up the bank go bad and he escapes into the hills with lin in pursuit in one of the best final shoot outs ever the two meet in the final showdown br br i believe that this movie was the only one of the stewart mann <UNK> that was shot in b w it is beautifully photographed especially the scenes in the wide open spaces and in particular the final showdown stewart playing against type plays the hero with a violent revenge motive edge an emotion that he would carry into future films with mann br br as in most universal westerns this one boasts a cast of seasoned veterans and contract players of the day in addition to those mentioned above j c <UNK> appears as the <UNK> sergeant steve <UNK> james <UNK> john <UNK> and chuck <UNK> as various henchmen ray <UNK> as the sheriff pursuing duryea tony curtis and james best as rookie soldiers and edmund <UNK> chief <UNK> and john war eagle in various roles in the dodge city sequence br br a classic western in every sense of the word it was responsible for re <UNK> stewart's career as an action star
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br alice having defeated freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re <UNK> her life but her unborn child is carrying a <UNK> presence freddy trying to come out into their world again br br it's interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing freddy films charles russell <UNK> the mask <UNK> <UNK> the long kiss <UNK> <UNK> island cliffhanger die hard 2 and here stephen hopkins lost in space predator 2 but while russell and <UNK> made a good job of it hopkins imo has made something of a <UNK> with this entry that should be quickly forgotten br br the story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with freddy <UNK> a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all br br the bon <UNK> bitch catch phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry
<START> so i'm wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra <UNK> wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from miss <UNK> did ms <UNK> also get to <UNK> through the role by <UNK> the before <UNK> hart as many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic add to that the <UNK> <UNK> viewer experiences with the character of cassie <UNK> as a somewhat darker <UNK> hart with more back story and it rapidly become a <UNK> fest br br the two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films as has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two <UNK> or try to be anything but trite stereotypes br br one last <UNK> using the term serial killer is false advertising murdering one person even if it's a <UNK> murder does not make you a serial killer you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer
<START> you're not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place they haven't done you any harm in the second place they may be <UNK> ah the <UNK> of no budget 50s sci <UNK> yet despite the odd gem like that superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean <UNK> minute running time it's beyond cheap the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation and pretty dull with it though it has a surprisingly <UNK> message ¬ñ the mute mole men <UNK> actors with <UNK> <UNK> and fur <UNK> who look more like mr <UNK> without the hat than <UNK> <UNK> released from their underground world by oil <UNK> are not <UNK> merely misunderstood and george <UNK> man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them an interesting <UNK> to the paranoia of the day perhaps but with little more than good intentions to recommend it
<START> debbie reynolds toe <UNK> <UNK> and yes tap dances her way through this ordinary thriller which has a distinctly <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere two ladies brought together when their sons commit a murder try starting their lives over by running a tap dance school for <UNK> in hollywood trouble is one of them is plagued by <UNK> can you imagine this thing 10 years earlier with robert <UNK> directing bette davis and joan crawford <UNK> bette never would have allowed joan so much screen time to <UNK> her stuff and i can't imagine bette davis in the other role tap dancing her heart out this is a purely bogus piece of macabre written by a <UNK> henry farrell whose idea of a good shock is to stage the mass murder of a group of <UNK> not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package 1 2 from
<START> what do you call a horror story without horror and story br br this is the most irritating thing about the film i get the feeling the writers never really decided what's actually going on in the film it's a different thing to know it give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it but here you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows remember cube even that film knew more about itself br br i've consumed a lot of 80's horror gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films but a lot of important things are missing we really know nothing about the characters they keep repeating empty lines over and over again the story isn't really developing it never goes anywhere b acting is ok in this type of horror films but there's not much to act in the script we don't care about the characters there's nothing to remember about them there's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex and most importantly no thrills no chills br br you only get some <UNK> used elements of the horror film genre they show the <UNK> monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story br br i honestly believe that this amount of story character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment oh yeah film makers used to do that and more some 20 years ago i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended too bad really
<START> steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to sort of in dan in real life a film which i expected not to like but ended up liking it not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it's just that it has a big heart we all like steve carell this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him but you know what i liked this movie br br carell stars as dan burns a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him one weekend him and his daughters travel down to see his family while there he goes to a <UNK> and falls for a woman when he gets back to his house he finds out that his brother mitch played by <UNK> cook is dating this woman played by juliette <UNK> br br dan in real life at times i found a bit unbelievable are the burns family really the kind of people who do <UNK> together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things i would highly doubt that i don't know any family who is like that is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up no br br dan in real life
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen i'm not kidding the next time it comes on i will just continually run my head into a wall it would me more enjoyable to sit in an <UNK> room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is <UNK> than attempting to make it through this movie again br br i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again they are both good comedians so i was shocked this was so awkward br br if they had to do it all over again i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it the folks that <UNK> the money must have lost a ton not really because the special effects all 2 of them were terrible
<START> 11 oscar nominations and zero win am yet to understand why its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with <UNK> <UNK> and denzel washington whoopi oprah margaret <UNK> danny glover etc were all amazing i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year it should go into the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> category for the judges br br its an amazing book but true to alice <UNK> style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is <UNK> her characters so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out br br the cinematography was amazing the african scenes live much to be desired the african part in the book is supposed to be set in <UNK> somewhere in west africa but oh no steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the <UNK> so yes there had to be a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> scene when we all know there are none west africa and most of all why get the people to speak <UNK> who in west africa speaks <UNK> i just had to get that out of the way br br but as a story amazing film making out of this world classic yes br br i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some <UNK>
<START> many people see this as a classic but i obviously must have missed something life in <UNK> texas in the early 50's is pretty dull which means that a movie about life in <UNK> texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too what is it that so many people see in this once the last picture show in <UNK> <UNK> there really won't be anything to do in town <UNK> jeff bridges makes that point at the end of the movie but even before it <UNK> there isn't much to do so basically everything revolves around sex high school students make plans for how to lose their virginity sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town you see there's not much for them to do either except to have sex sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers or to <UNK> about the local high school football team three times something happened that i thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie sam ben johnson dies unexpectedly but nothing really happens because of that sonny timothy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> shepherd <UNK> but nothing really happens because of that joe bob <UNK> doyle kidnaps a little girl but nothing really happens because of that the only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of billy sam <UNK> which really points out the <UNK> of life in this pathetic little town as the men stand around looking at the body <UNK> where to go for breakfast br br peter <UNK> filmed this in black and white which is intended i suppose to point out how grey this town is but the only thing i found interesting was the early look at actors like <UNK> shepherd bridges and randy quaid as an aside it was terrifying to see how much quaid in 1971 actually looks like his character of cousin eddie in the national lampoon vacation movies classic i don't think so 3 10
<START> it's one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising i have spoken before on another film in which the commercial for the comedy film makes it seem funnier than it is seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film what i and my brother who went and saw it with me didn't know is that the scene used in the tv ad was the very last scene in the film br br since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film i can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use the last scene is thanks to a youth <UNK> dr fu <UNK> turns from a long <UNK> old man into a bright young asian elvis like rock star with back up singers no less br br set for no real reason in the 1930's peter sellers does his best with the material at hand but he's not given any really good reason for his comedic moments the rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and i sat all through this barely laughing at anything it was only natural that we were expecting a pink <UNK> type comedy peter sellers was so great at that br br it's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died his appearance on the muppet show was more entertaining than this ill conceived flop still i don't fault him i fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this 2 stars is being generous
<START> i rented this movie because i hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy although the movie is family friendly my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of god if you <UNK> god and follow him you are not guaranteed success your football team won't always win you won't magically get better <UNK> <UNK> isn't always <UNK> you won't always get a raise sometimes you'll be stuck with the old car br br god does not exist to meet our every <UNK> rather we were created to <UNK> him sometimes we <UNK> him most when things seem to be going bad for us to live is christ to die is gain
<START> i remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn't have any special effects the acting was really good and it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well larry norman was a really good <UNK> during that time period although now most christian music is now worship and praise music i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family i would like to have an update
<START> all of the reviews here about how much <UNK> lacks plot the acting is wooden the orgy scene makes no sense etc all miss the main point br br let's be honest this is a movie made in the <UNK> times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h i g h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance br br find some kind bud and smoke up or get a mild hit of acid seriously these straight and sober reviews of <UNK> miss the point you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind br br until you've watched this movie on the big screen which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when <UNK> was quite rare <UNK> out you have no idea what this movie is all about br br if you insist on watching it not <UNK> you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink <UNK> wonderful re working of careful with that axe eugene come in number <UNK> your time is up
<START> i still wonder why i watched this movie admittedly before i viewed this film i knew <UNK> nothing about the beatles i didn't even know all their names all i knew was that they had a ton of fans they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever they broke up john married <UNK> <UNK> and john was murdered br br also <UNK> isn't even my favorite music station mtv is still for some reason or another i decided to watch it not expecting much surprisingly i enjoyed it very much the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up this is very important because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film <UNK> they are taken outside to explore more possibilities and to keep you watching jared harris and <UNK> quinn give good <UNK> overall br br the ending was also very smart i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl <UNK> and then <UNK> you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go and end it on a good note my favorite moment is probably the touching <UNK> scene br br overall i recommend this film to almost everyone it is a very good way of <UNK> your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john's <UNK> which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film <UNK> my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the <UNK>
<START> after 21 movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be <UNK> with as mildred rogers davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a <UNK> waitress who becomes the target of leslie <UNK> affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no <UNK> of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would <UNK> it also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history br br at circa 85 minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of philip carey howard as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again br br howard and <UNK> chemistry is all but non existent davis <UNK> in an interview much later in life she personally didn't care much for <UNK> <UNK> towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as mildred all the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence then again <UNK> direction has a certain <UNK> about itself that fails to come through at times he tries to fill in some space whenever davis is not there with <UNK> and montages <UNK> the passing of time a <UNK> <UNK> over a changing frances dee all much in the style back then this was before <UNK> and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a <UNK> bare <UNK> translation of the <UNK> <UNK> novel which is saying a lot since at <UNK> pages of human bondage would have been indeed hard to film even then br br <UNK> it feels that philip carey may be something of a <UNK> for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that mildred never hides her <UNK> from the get go <UNK> performance never seems to go through much <UNK> emotion his eyes are constantly sad his expression never <UNK> too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in the accidental tourist <UNK> hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by kay johnson and frances dee are making themselves vulnerable to <UNK> affections interestingly <UNK> <UNK> once she realizes carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred and mildred herself is bound to miller or men who fit the role of <UNK> in her short but memorable scene she's the one who holds the essence of the story's moral

<START> the movie is a fantasy the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully i still cannot believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well some of the dialog is wonderfully clever the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a <UNK> <UNK> fashion show from 1942 br br movies are designed to serve various purposes this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count some of the closeups made me uncomfortable but he could still sing and sing <UNK> however <UNK> macdonald was just as dazzling as ever she makes a spectacular angel br br this genre is well before my time and i an new to the <UNK> macdonald nelson eddy films and related conversation the music in this movie is beautiful as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable more delightful better constructed the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today and <UNK> macdonald without the benefit of beverly hills plastic <UNK> was more beautiful than the stars i see today i am unclear as to why so many other posters are <UNK> about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what i think this movie will <UNK> still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed i recommend this movie without <UNK> to anyone who <UNK> great talent great beauty and great music
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the acting by the adult actors was great although i did find the main kid a little stiff but he carried himself very well for being a new talent the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk i e the nutty professor if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced i picked it up on <UNK> ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch probably one of the better looking <UNK> <UNK> i've seen so far the extras were cool too they deleted quite a bit but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything
<START> undoubtedly one of the great john ford's masterpieces young mr lincoln went practically <UNK> at the time of its initial release no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released including the most mythical western in the history of the genre john ford's <UNK> <UNK> and many others such as gone with the wind the wizard of oz mr smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr lincoln was nominated for which is original screenplay br br it continued to be the most underrated ford's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford's masterpieces but by the end of the 1950s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director <UNK> <UNK> about the young mr lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then it would be definitely john ford's young mr lincoln impressed by such an <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film's reputation has been increasing ever since br br it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american <UNK> was brought to the screen right in the beginning of the 1930s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford's film mgm released john <UNK> one called <UNK> lincoln in <UNK> curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in 1938 and written by robert <UNK> br br as far as john ford's films are concerned we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical <UNK> figure in several of director's works such as <UNK> the iron horse or 1936 the prisoner of the shark island the second one just as young mr lincoln <UNK> as the main musical theme the favourite <UNK> song <UNK> br br the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and <UNK> <UNK> was written by <UNK> <UNK> in collaboration with john ford himself which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as <UNK> and legends about the beginning of abraham <UNK> life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears <UNK> where lincoln <UNK> the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to <UNK> a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the <UNK> attorney played by donald meek demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously <UNK> her to the making of an impossible choice of <UNK> to death one and letting live the other br br overall it's a very touching heart warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming <UNK> of other characters no matter how little or how big they are <UNK> from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and <UNK> by the ability of john ford's genius at one of its best <UNK> ever a definite must see for everyone 10 10
<START> this was truly dreadful it had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good br br it took all my <UNK> to make it through this one it's a good job i didn't have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic br br the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women not a bad one among them br br if you want to <UNK> with your friends after a night on the beer then this one's for you else avoid it like the plague
<START> look i loved the proper anchorman film but this was <UNK> bad the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life the kind of bad that makes you think what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place the kind of bad that makes you wish you'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a <UNK> during the film the kind of bad that makes <UNK> look fun the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a <UNK> shore film instead seriously i cannot explain how very bad this was br br having said that there were some semi amusing laughs but they are all so much less funny than anchorman sure they tried to make it entertaining and fun but the entire subplot that was left out of anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason it wasn't even a little bit good br br do yourself a favour or in the usa a favor and don't watch this dvd it will <UNK> the good movie that anchorman is and you don't want to do that br br okay i'm alright now
<START> what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless movie a remake that did not need to be <UNK> everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments worst movie i ever saw save your time and money br br <UNK> cage was <UNK> down hills swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by <UNK> but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene br br although a good cast with ellen <UNK> and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies don't they get a copy of the script first if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd
<START> both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability i simply cried glenn <UNK> role as ruth showed her wanting to deal with the situation but she was under the <UNK> of her husband let him think about what he did robert <UNK> character joe said <UNK> the story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother called the stone boy meaning he was so <UNK> and overwhelmed by what he did he became emotionally <UNK> then towards the end when jason <UNK> character arnold let it all out to a stranger i was so broken hearted for him that i actually thought of some of the terrible things that i did in my life i <UNK> and identified with his character <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> roles did not add not much to the film i thought of <UNK> forrest who played <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brother andy as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation his wife lou played by <UNK> <UNK> acted like a crazy lady <UNK> arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and <UNK> him for her troubles i could not really feel sorry for these two though lou tried to keep her marriage together she was <UNK> both did not deal with their problems effectively they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> minor role as the grandfather was touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention i felt his role should have been <UNK> the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient however i really liked the ending so much i actually <UNK> and cried tears of joy i felt good the <UNK> were a family again i actually wanted to be a part of this family they were so realistic
<START> a genuine screaming situation comedy farce of the mid 70s this film was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared off the face of the earth i am constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a big release one week and then <UNK> high anxiety the cheap detective the black bird don't look now we're being shot at and have no profile at all today norman was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again famous for being shot on <UNK> and transferred to film an experiment at the time norman is a <UNK> politically incorrect closet <UNK> farce that the <UNK> brothers should look at <UNK> today if they had made it in the first place there would be no complaints about its content and <UNK> either it is very funny and yes very rude and hilariously all wrong just as it should be in fact as a <UNK> 1976 film with all those horror colours and clothes it actually works better today
<START> visually stunning most definitely i have seen few films look this good in some time sky captain and the world of tomorrow uses striking cinematography computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh the time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s the movie tells of recent attacks on new york city by <UNK> <UNK> stealing <UNK> and the like for some inexplicable reason also mysterious <UNK> of relevant scientific minds <UNK> who can stop them and save the world alright it doesn't take a leap of faith to know it is the sky captain himself with his <UNK> reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead and in the wings his <UNK> thoroughly competent sidekick what sky captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization the plot for this film is ridiculous that being said the film is going for a serial like feeling of film serials of <UNK> they had pretty far out stories and bad acting but none of them and i mean none of them had the budget and big names this film had two academy award winning performers and jude law could keep a film <UNK> one would think but sky captain sinks miserably despite its fantastic dark look i found myself wishing the film would just end and i could get on with my life i had little interest in a story that generated little interest i didn't care at all for any of the <UNK> portrayals paltrow was just awful jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance law cannot carry the one liner tradition all too <UNK> on his limited shoulders i mean let's face it he's not will smith mel gibson or even wesley snipes the sad thing about sky captain at least for me was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little i was bored ten minutes into the film waiting for something to hook my interest and it never came
<START> the main reason people still care about <UNK> <UNK> of the f o is that it features peter sellers in a second billed role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake br br sellers plays <UNK> a vaguely <UNK> prime minister of the dirt poor island nation of <UNK> <UNK> a british colony now <UNK> a lot of russian <UNK> during the height of the cold war <UNK> wants to play both u k and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terry thomas is the title character a lazy british <UNK> anxious to show <UNK> that great britain hasn't forgotten them all appearances to the contrary br br a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason <UNK> <UNK> is considered below average is because the comedy is non existent br br after a decent opening that <UNK> the film's only two strengths a <UNK> <UNK> terry thomas and john <UNK> full on <UNK> score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame <UNK> jokes the low opinion of <UNK> <UNK> by his boss and the obscurity of <UNK> which no one can find on a map is <UNK> to death by the time we actually reach the island after a <UNK> series of <UNK> jokes expectations are quite low br br they're still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the <UNK> is so pathetic its honor guard <UNK> at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame <UNK> gag by a thick <UNK> <UNK> in war the army uses many horse br br sellers never quite takes center stage even when we're on his character's island the plot is taken over instead by ian <UNK> as king <UNK> who <UNK> the throne of <UNK> after his father's assassination <UNK> is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scene stealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and <UNK> <UNK> sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that <UNK> and i'm all right jack br br strange that this film like jack was a <UNK> brothers production with roy <UNK> here serving as co director alongside jeffrey <UNK> usually <UNK> films combine wicked social satire with anything goes comedy but here there are only <UNK> <UNK> in either direction <UNK> works his <UNK> english vibe for all its worth this man is like how do you say the bull in the chinese ship while <UNK> <UNK> is generally <UNK> on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve br br the weakest and most <UNK> element of the film is young <UNK> romance with <UNK> score one point for her being played by ravishing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed br br the film winds up with a <UNK> staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by <UNK> <UNK> that would seem to nail the <UNK> on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly <UNK>
<START> student seduction finds saved by the bell <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> on the other side of the desk and <UNK> the attention of young and hunky corey <UNK> speaking for myself i can <UNK> say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me <UNK> back when i was a student that was a ms diaz who was a music teacher in junior high school even as a young gay kid i could see what she was doing to the rest of the class she was the only teacher i had who in any way could have been played by elizabeth <UNK> br br corey being the <UNK> he is is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not the fact that he comes from rich parents <UNK> that belief he's <UNK> chemistry which is what <UNK> teaches and to keep his <UNK> up she agrees to <UNK> but believe no more br br so when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's <UNK> to his ego when <UNK> goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of pamela smart and mary kay <UNK> just don't believe here <UNK> parents have the <UNK> to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy br br student seduction which is a <UNK> of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way after the beating that <UNK> took for <UNK> this tv film was not an <UNK> career move
<START> a <UNK> couple move into the home of the husband's dead former wife it's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone doesn't want her in the house she sees <UNK> all around the house but when the husband <UNK> he can't find anything is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently <UNK> from or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house br br this is the first time that i've watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew and it will in all <UNK> be the last time i watch it this way can you say dull i'm not talking ordinary dull i'm talking watching grass grow dull there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it the characters <UNK> on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable the screaming skull could probably be <UNK> as a sleep <UNK> br br the actors don't help matters much most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play i haven't looked it up but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value i won't even go into the script the actors are given to work with let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever <UNK> on film br br you've been warned either avoid this one at all costs or at least seek out the mst3k version
<START> the <UNK> stars jerry springer as a tv <UNK> host called jerry but it s not the jerry springer show his guests are trailer trash but not the trailer trash you get on the jerry springer show they attack one another but not like on what is the point of making a movie about the jerry springer show and pretending it s not the jerry springer show and on top of that this is a very boring film
<START> this is not the stuff of soap operas but the sort of <UNK> that real people face in real life a testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story telling of <UNK> characters trying to cope but not quite <UNK>
<START> i get the feeling that those involved in making surviving christmas didn't put much thought into the movie the characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the one liner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend christmas with them br br ben affleck portrays drew <UNK> the typical hollywood image of a wealthy <UNK> advertising executive who buys his way through life his girlfriend <UNK> leaves him shortly before christmas because she's disgusted that drew wanted to take her to <UNK> for christmas which she calls the family holiday and the fact that drew has never introduced her to his family we later find out that <UNK> father left when he was 4 years old and his mother is dead so it's a mystery why he doesn't just say that he has no family rather than allow his girlfriend to believe that he doesn't care about his family br br out of fear of being alone on christmas drew tracks down <UNK> shrink why i have no idea who suggests he do a forgiveness ritual at his childhood home when he meets the family living in his childhood home the <UNK> drew offers them 250 000 to pretend to be his family so he can <UNK> his fond childhood memories he gets angry when he later finds out that they have an adult daughter alicia christina <UNK> because he doesn't have a sister and even goes so far as to write a script for the family to follow so that they act more like his real family none of this makes any sense once drew reveals that he grew up with no family but his mother br br also inexplicable is the character of alicia who is annoyed that her family accepted <UNK> money and refuses to play along with his fantasy but for no good reason she suddenly starts to like drew and in a matter of minutes goes from hating his guts to acting like his girlfriend drew is such a complete jerk throughout the movie that even his sad story about the lonely <UNK> of his childhood evokes no sympathy i almost wish he had finished with just kidding the real reason i don't see my family is that they all have <UNK> orders against me 2 10
<START> a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel <UNK> blazing <UNK> into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it is br br the laugh track only serves to remind the <UNK> viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is br br however it is somewhat interesting to see louis <UNK> jr trying his best to <UNK> <UNK> little his embarrassment shows through in every scene he was much funnier in the hbo movie el <UNK> than he was here in this <UNK> of cheese br br truly the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse
<START> i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now i must really love it right well not really br br i was a <UNK> earlier in my life and i loved the sport to this day i am fascinated by good surfing riding giants has plenty of that and thus i am a sucker for the thing but i definitely have some bones to pick with it <UNK> you listening br br first the movie has too little faith in its subject matter the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined very very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish <UNK> seems addicted to a hyper <UNK> cut and pace method it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot <UNK> in northern california not a single wave is ridden start to finish almost the entire section on <UNK> one third of the movie is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack i can understand the effect <UNK> was trying to achieve with <UNK> as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone <UNK> waves in <UNK> open ocean chop but he goes way too far <UNK> is not just a bad acid trip waves are actually ridden there even with great performances it would have been good to see some of them if <UNK> thinks this is a grand sport and i am sure he does then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much at times the editing <UNK> the movie to the <UNK> there is one fast clip in the section on <UNK> in hawaii which i still cannot understand even if i run it on slow motion on dvd the image is too fast to be <UNK> it must be a couple of frames in length at the max br br second have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement it is particularly <UNK> to watch the narrated <UNK> version on dvd these guys sound like two over the top valley girls the same sentiment shows up in the main production every thing is always so <UNK> amazing etc one character in particular is just plain obnoxious sam george the editor of <UNK> magazine who is practically <UNK> in his pants every time he has anything to say he is a super drag on the movie br br there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie i mean just to get the old movie shots they have and also all of the interviews the movie is a great story and i think it is generally captivating entertainment <UNK> it is well laid out with the three parts <UNK> around greg <UNK> jeff clark and <UNK> hamilton respectively there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal in the <UNK> narration they say it is a new type of 3d technology and it really works the three principle characters shine both in their interviews and in the water as an <UNK> <UNK> hamilton is a revelation he rises to the <UNK> of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball and too the story of his meeting his father is a gem it really touched me br br it is just that the movie could have been so much more the very last part of the movie when the credits roll gives a hint of what it could have been there are some beautiful <UNK> shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish though you may like it if you are fan of the modern frenetic school of rock anyway there's my two cents
<START> i don't know who got the idea that <UNK> go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd <UNK> are most definitely not the cold blooded killer this movie makes them out to be its silly <UNK> are extremely intelligent don't get me wrong but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was so i was at least somewhat amused by it personally i'd recommend going and seeing jaws if you're wanting to see an animal killing humans type of movie but if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i'd say go ahead d
<START> this is a very chilling and for the most part a well thought out drama i am very impressed at the film not just for the plot and superb acting but that such a unique movie was made most movies involving a spy or a war are filled with a slick talking brit or a mighty battle but not this this isn't about this kind of war its about the war between a man and his position in life an american spy in germany posing as a <UNK> of an evil no one will ever forget when the war is over <UNK> thinks he will come home as a hero but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret going back to america <UNK> meets nazi supporters as well as nazi <UNK> providing for interesting conflicts both <UNK> and <UNK> nolte more than pulls off the role and fits the plot quite well for what it's asking
<START> in a word amazing br br i initially was not too keen to watch <UNK> since i thought this would be another movie <UNK> over the <UNK> and would show <UNK> towards india and <UNK> i was so totally wrong <UNK> is a heart wrenching emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws i was haunted by it after watching it it <UNK> on my mind for so long the themes the pain the loss the emotion all was so real br br this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no <UNK> or prejudices and has given the <UNK> a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil <UNK> and good indians and <UNK> the cinematography is excellent and the music is <UNK> meaningful thanks to <UNK> <UNK> and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast br br if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie look no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart amazing cannot describe how excellent it is
<START> if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre i would change my rating to an eight try to imagine a movie where every scene line and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody i could probably crap out <UNK> soup <UNK> what was left of the letters and still have a better script two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie spoiler alert one is when <UNK> dad and the other dad walk i repeat walk down a <UNK> jam packed with zombies this is a small <UNK> and even though they brush up against the <UNK> undead nothing happens to them when they reach the end the ex marine turns around says god you're a horny bastard and shoots only one the other is in the military complex the girl stabs a zombie with a <UNK> and is immediately surrounded the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at an <UNK> length away she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans spoiler alert over these scenes must be seen to be believed still i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else
<START> it's not just that this is a bad movie it's not only that four of the best mexican movie makers are in this film and it's not only that the script is terrible it's just that this movie sucks big time this people are wasting money in terrible scripts it's supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films is bad language supposed to be funny i don't get it mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing and being written and produced br br please don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico we hate them and they don't reflect us
<START> this is a truly wretched little film admittedly the original un holy <UNK> was <UNK> by the law of <UNK> returns with the third the final conflict <UNK> into a ridiculous sub plot about half way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole <UNK> <UNK> for the omen series but then to <UNK> this jumped up tv movie beware <UNK> of the omen box set on dvd don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer this was and is strictly small screen stuff on the back of a series of generally fine demonic <UNK> was unforgivable particularly <UNK> as it was by the <UNK> producer and producer of the first three movies <UNK> <UNK> and harvey <UNK> i'd give away the plot if there was any besides the usual death scenes hopelessly toned down for tv sensibilities and some of the worst acting i've seen all involved in this project down to the <UNK> people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen let alone <UNK> under the omen name if one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess i'll feel better for it
<START> a good picture is worth all the words this film has the most poetic scene ever <UNK> of about people with <UNK> syndrome and i won't spoil it by telling you you'll want to see it yourself br br <UNK> <UNK> is an amazing actor i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning br br the film has a magic of it's own after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love passion and simplicity is all we need
<START> sure this movie wasn't like 16 <UNK> inside man an american haunting etc br br but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary br br i live exactly where they filmed this movie san <UNK> california and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie br br i <UNK> if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mary well that boat is haunted i believe in <UNK> <UNK> and parallel or however u spell that is real everybody's in there own universe br br and the mind is a powerful thing br br i recommend to watch this movie it's great and not bad directing at all br br for those who rate it a 1 they don't understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us br br <UNK> br br victor
<START> first of all i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie that the actor who played the <UNK> is one of my friends his name is robert <UNK> he's a terrific actor although it doesn't say much about his filmography he's been in several plays and musicals he is currently <UNK> in <UNK> b c that is where i am from he comes over to our house almost every saturday laughs okay now about the movie i wouldn't <UNK> this to anyone who hasn't seen it for it is not a movie worth watching the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place it keeps <UNK> back between time so kinda hard to follow at some points and second its really boring laughs although the acting is great the movie just doesn't compare
<START> my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie passing them down in the family if you will and i loved it br br clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men <UNK> and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it's up to superman to stop this mayhem br br it's just so wonderful and fun to view the old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid and i'm 16 now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are
<START> this is just flat out unwatchable if there's a story in here somewhere it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's <UNK> there's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them they pop their heads out and talk like <UNK> <UNK> if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien <UNK> puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude <UNK> it with a cattle <UNK> well that's what you get here these folks are loud obnoxious violent and just extremely annoying then there are some anti human humans who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take these folks make <UNK> <UNK> seem like a right wing <UNK> in comparison they're friends with some vampires or something who cares br br then there's the camera work remember how everybody hated the thousand cuts a minute crap from the recent <UNK> remake the folks who made this movie love that stuff there's enough of it in here for three really crappy <UNK> metal videos on mtv br br <UNK> said this thing <UNK> in comparison dracula 3000 is a <UNK>
<START> definitely at the top five of best john garfield movies has to be pride of the marines it's the true story of marine private al <UNK> who at the cost of his own sight while wounded held off a <UNK> of <UNK> japanese on <UNK> br br the story nicely segments in three parts al <UNK> home life where he's a simple working stiff who's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his <UNK> night pearl harbor is bombed and he's off to war as millions of others were br br the second part is at <UNK> and we see part of the action where he's in an isolated machine gun nest holding off japanese troops his action prevented marine positions from being <UNK> but a <UNK> does in his <UNK> br br and of course the third part is his painful <UNK> to <UNK> life and to <UNK> himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity most of all that girl he was seeing <UNK> parker br br this film was broadcast on tcm on john <UNK> <UNK> birthday and there was a documentary on garfield <UNK> by his daughter one of the people interviewed said that garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card br br in that respect he was lucky in that he did land with warner brothers in hollywood though he kept getting <UNK> in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background because he came from the kind of life al <UNK> had with the exception of <UNK> jewish background br br in that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like al <UNK> who accepted the responsibility of defending his country no super <UNK> here just a guy who'd rather have been back in philadelphia but doing a job that had to be done br br it's a great part for garfield it's a film one shouldn't miss i do wonder though whatever happened to the real al <UNK>
<START> this is truly one from the golden age of hollywood the kind they do not make anymore it is an unique fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next br br all the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors this is the first movie i saw with ronald colman in it and i have been a fan of his ever since <UNK> <UNK> has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in while he played a different kind of character here he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added
<START> this is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life it is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence however the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen br br i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but it's not i did not laugh once while watching it nor did i even crack a smile the makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts br br some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them
<START> this <UNK> written by famous serbian theatre film writer <UNK> <UNK> is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category and yet its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value a masterpiece one should not miss to see preferably with subtitles and not dubbed br br in an aged bus en route to capital <UNK> a <UNK> war decides the <UNK> behaviour two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also <UNK> a tragedy to come their singing both <UNK> and <UNK> stages in this extraordinary road movie real life <UNK> brothers are amateur actors but together with <UNK> <UNK> as farmer who's <UNK> the road give a real life performance br br the spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war an insight into <UNK> collective person everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can hoping that ignorance might <UNK> the tragedy using a simple movie language director <UNK> <UNK> paints a picture of society torn by previous war world war i but also highlights personal <UNK> with success <UNK> of a singer <UNK> of the <UNK> seriousness of the great war veteran who is on way to visit his recently <UNK> son and gloomy <UNK> from a man who seems to be a german spy br br brilliant in its narration with memorable soundtrack <UNK> the <UNK> songs and <UNK> atmosphere well photographed and edited this feature <UNK> feature debut was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter sweet comedies that will define serbian cinematography of the 1980s <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and my other director's favourite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this isn't <UNK> and <UNK> or <UNK> and <UNK> but it is a fine road movie it sets up its two main characters gently and easily viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly which is a tribute to the director there is the young french and english speaking son who wants to do well in france has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol parties as young men do and there is his <UNK> <UNK> and french speaking father who <UNK> follows his muslim faith with <UNK> and the wisdom of <UNK> and who rejects the new culture surrounding him like mobile phones the film could explore very powerful politics the odd couple drive thru the former <UNK> thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to <UNK> these are areas where the muslim <UNK> have been involved in wars <UNK> ethnic <UNK> where <UNK> have pursued torture and summary <UNK> to hold power and where religious <UNK> are in constant deadly battle with each other yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such <UNK> the relationship between the two is key to this film and faith politics are the backdrop it seems to be saying that we are all human and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world it certainly isn't <UNK> born <UNK> and is all the better for it
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen this year you should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are spoilers gray matters centers on gray and sam baldwin heather graham and tom <UNK> only gray and sam are brother and sister living together in everyone else's eyes as man and wife no sex but just about everything else early on the movie starts with its theme 'the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd <UNK> gray and sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed <UNK> rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the <UNK> gritty questions too when she <UNK> her brother to come over they start a 3 way date charlie bridget <UNK> is the girl of their dreams like all the right things <UNK> sam final hits gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage <UNK> that charlie accepts in one week charlie gray and sam are to be in vegas in the next week charlie and gray are off shopping for wedding <UNK> apparently charlie has an off the rack figure gray is <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> when charlie suggests gray tries on some <UNK> as well and picks out a 10 000 <UNK> for her while charlie is <UNK> her in this <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> gray continues to <UNK> on the <UNK> i swear it was like a feed bag what should happen but <UNK> ' <UNK> all over the <UNK> it is never explained how they got out of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with out a 10 000 <UNK> colored <UNK> back to <UNK> ¬ñ <UNK> palace las vegas they have the <UNK> roller <UNK> sam is a resident surgeon and charlie is an <UNK> <UNK> ¬ñ were do they get all this money gray kicks sam out to the single room down the hall so she and charlie can have a <UNK> drink a <UNK> were you guessed it they kiss gray remembers everything charlie remembers <UNK> they make it to wedding <UNK> and right when the <UNK> gets to his line if there is anybody is here who has any <UNK> whatsoever to the union of these two <UNK> gray gets the <UNK> gray excuses herself for some reason the <UNK> must repeat his last line and right on <UNK> again <UNK> gray gets back to ny and starts dating any man she meets literally and of course one is you guessed it again gay the other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver alan <UNK> named <UNK> he is <UNK> with gray but the feelings are not returned they become great friends this is good because when she comes clean with sam about the kiss he blows up and kicks her out of their apartment when sam comes to his senses he goes to her office gray works at an ad agency this office is <UNK> in the middle of the twilight zone it has cameras and <UNK> in all the <UNK> rooms that broadcast to all computer <UNK> at the agency sam gets gray in one of the <UNK> rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office this is where i doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew <UNK> comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar <UNK> no <UNK> says the <UNK> so gray and <UNK> return with <UNK> in drag bad drag he was in a <UNK> black <UNK> like <UNK> a string of <UNK> and a <UNK> church hat no lesbian would ever confuse this <UNK> in a <UNK> as a drag queen much less a woman the bar was also the straight man's fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of victoria's secret models everything turns out <UNK> ¬ñ she goes home with her <UNK> client gray happens to be on the woman's account and finally does more then kiss for some reason no one tells charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with gray but that is for the sequel

<START> film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light good night and good luck for instance offered parallels to modern judgement without evidence and <UNK> on freedom it is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation with pornography we consider ourselves <UNK> and our <UNK> to be <UNK> by quaint ideas usually involving fire and <UNK> but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and <UNK> interpretation instead of evidence bettie page was a cult icon of an era which included not just <UNK> but the <UNK> of comics such as tales from the crypt on the basis that they would turn <UNK> into half mad juvenile <UNK> this film developed from key questions raised in her life poses <UNK> that are as relevant today as back in 1950 br br our film opens with two key scenes in the first we see well dressed respectable looking men in a seedy <UNK> one of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained then turns out to be an undercover cop <UNK> a <UNK> the second scene shows bettie page waiting to be called as a witness looking quite <UNK> as if she had just come out of church br br the first <UNK> are in black white old fashioned film effects such as <UNK> and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from <UNK> years as do the mannerisms of the cast <UNK> <UNK> 1950s scenes <UNK> <UNK> phrases and the <UNK> dialogue associated with film making of the period archive footage is frequently <UNK> which will delight many and <UNK> others in keeping with its theme the movie is almost a collection of different types of photography in motion and the older clips of fabulous <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> well against <UNK> classic poses <UNK> back to an age of <UNK> <UNK> magazines although i admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy br br very soon we go into flashback bettie escapes a depression years <UNK> life in <UNK> <UNK> only with church singing and soul saving and goes alone to make her own way after her initial success her <UNK> work <UNK> into two <UNK> the mainstream <UNK> work <UNK> on her over the <UNK> smile and the <UNK> <UNK> photos involving dressing up in high <UNK> boots and light bondage gear in an earlier audition reminiscent of a scene with <UNK> <UNK> character in <UNK> drive who was also called betty she gives a performance that is full of emotion <UNK> with her normal animated cheerful but ultimately bland day to day expression is part of her still <UNK> bettie is frequently rejected in <UNK> once they realise she is the well known pin up girl but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page her abusive childhood is quickly <UNK> and <UNK> over when she is raped by four hometown <UNK> we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving picking herself up in deserted <UNK> and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die br br although no nudity is involved it's <UNK> special interest photos that eventually <UNK> trouble when we go back to the court the opinions of a <UNK> on the <UNK> influence of such photos are taken as evidence a psychologist <UNK> says how the photos lead to <UNK> murder and <UNK> in youngsters who are exposed to them presumably not in that order eventually a star witness explains how his son's life came to an end as a result of such photos <UNK> <UNK> up like <UNK> it is not made clear how being <UNK> <UNK> causes death the text accompanying a series of <UNK> photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure <UNK> <UNK> with the fetish <UNK> the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the <UNK> like the photos themselves were pure <UNK> after a <UNK> wait bettie is told her evidence she is the one person who could state <UNK> that she was not photographed in agony will <UNK> be <UNK> the <UNK> of the photos have been proved br br if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left consider a recent 2003 incident in which an ann <UNK> <UNK> was banned it said for fashion and passion whip along to your local store with a photograph of a woman's back she's wearing a <UNK> and <UNK> and her hands are <UNK> behind her back the <UNK> and sex toys company that targets female <UNK> and also supports <UNK> fighting domestic violence said its <UNK> aimed to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page <UNK> still holds <UNK> br br <UNK> religious views are integral to the story just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the <UNK> nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us as opposed to the more factual approach found in <UNK> europe it could be <UNK> the <UNK> of sin and redemption and being saved are even reflected in <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> traditional male <UNK> a policeman making a friendly but sexually motivated approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to <UNK> her from loneliness the knight in shining <UNK> might be <UNK> but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue br br love it or hate it the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film and a moral wake up call for those that <UNK> it there is excellent ensemble acting and gretchen mol as bettie is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance
<START> after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes no actor should ever display such <UNK> as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr <UNK> portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in literature jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other the great actor basil <UNK> is i must admit a close second but is still second one might make the argument that mr <UNK> screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions <UNK> mr brett and to this i would agree however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become sherlock holmes the book should be closed on this subject and we the public left to enjoy mr <UNK> unique performances br br bill rogers br br <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> if you have seen <UNK> and z boys or have any interest in seeing the real non caricature real american side of america then riding giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before br br this film is unreal a <UNK> term if ever there was one but hugely appropriate if you can <UNK> any form of literal meaning out of it it is a 100 factual documentary but with all the drama of an opera and the completely apparent sense of love expert and knowing <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> direction and narration this film expertly leads you from <UNK> to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the <UNK> of seeing br br this film is a <UNK> crafted as well as <UNK> <UNK> beginning beautifully with its <UNK> in hawaii <UNK> deeply on human emotion in santa <UNK> and finishing with <UNK> triumph and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> again in hawaii br br like classical music like <UNK> <UNK> ride of the <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> for strings this may be the only piece you like but it's worth it trust me
<START> this has got to be the <UNK> stupidest most retarded monster film of all time it's a complete joke that this even <UNK> into theaters this is sort of like watching the <UNK> <UNK> monster in rural america this movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten john carradine shame on you the people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be <UNK> wait maybe i'm giving them too much credit i'm sure they were <UNK> before the filming how else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains don't waste a minute of your life watching this don't even waste your time sending a review
<START> guys who ever even thinks about watching this movie has already got some <UNK> going through their heads this movie has nothing to do with jack the <UNK> <UNK> you thought its another b i mean e grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their <UNK> <UNK> on a nearby tree its not scary funny or amusing if you really feel like gory stuff with no plot then watch cabin fever at least the director did not fall asleep <UNK> through directing this crap only watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life the only thing on tv is oprah <UNK> crying on the tv set
<START> i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them i rented this dvd from 2 movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the 3rd dvd player i tried br br anyone else have this issue it's really hard to give the film an un biased review after going through such a <UNK> to play it for one i've never seen a <UNK> horror film before so i was sort of <UNK> that the movie was done in english also since it's never made clear what is wrong with sarah she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away
<START> this grainy film has a cult following and one of those word of mouth features you just had to see maybe hard to believe but there is a rural community in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that knows the legend is true this tale is told in documentary style narrated by <UNK> <UNK> and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved the legend changes with the telling but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of <UNK> was visited by a bigfoot like creature that traveled along <UNK> creek long <UNK> with three <UNK> and standing over 7 foot tall this <UNK> creature <UNK> caused damage and frightened the <UNK> out of most of the community i personally crossed over the small <UNK> creek bridge in 1974 and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise of course it was about 1 a m in the rain by the time i arrived in <UNK> i was laughing
<START> i started to watch this movie with high expectations however after one hour i gave up on this movie as it only <UNK> lots of unanswered questions upon me this already started in the opening sequence and only got worse br br why would they bury the <UNK> under a statue why is there an italian <UNK> present why did the <UNK> wife save the <UNK> why did he upon being saved not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the <UNK> wife why did the <UNK> wife not save the <UNK> at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around why did these presumably illiterate <UNK> understand italian why did the italian <UNK> know about the <UNK> gold why did he hide it in the <UNK> in the midst of the evil <UNK> property these and many more questions popped up and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way so i guess i am totally missing the point of this movie and i am not connecting to the story in any way
<START> while not as bad as it has been made to be i have seen much worse this is still a very lame movie basically a rehash of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the main difference being that clint eastwood's hat has more charisma than the whole of joe don baker an unappealing actor if there was one br br however <UNK> <UNK> is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget <UNK> <UNK> he is the main reason to sit through this <UNK> as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl poor old <UNK> <UNK> hard to believe he was once a romantic lead watch <UNK> <UNK> to see him running away from women looking here like a second <UNK> ben <UNK> he's given next to nothing to do it's all joe <UNK> show unfortunately and all of it scored to generic 80's action movie music that couldn't be more boring br br <UNK> clark can make good b movies without warning but here he <UNK> falls breaks his nose and loses three teeth well at least the <UNK> locations were nice and there's <UNK> to try to save the day 3 10
<START> dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until it s first broadcast on network television tonight actually seeing as i m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe my theory was proved right for the most part br br minor spoilers br br what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved for example early in the film the bad guys are flying dracula s coffin from london to america in a twin engine <UNK> prop plane and one of the bad guys is left alone in the <UNK> hold where dracula comes to life a fight breaks out there s lots of noise but the bad guys in the <UNK> don t hear a sound until the script demands it it also appears in this segment s climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses sloppy scripting and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there s numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans <UNK> <UNK> then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they re back at the <UNK> <UNK> the scene after that which means the lack of <UNK> in the plot is enhanced br br there s something else that <UNK> my chain product placement there s <UNK> scenes where the <UNK> for a certain record label <UNK> chain is in full view i won t dare <UNK> the company brand except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british <UNK> <UNK> and i m surprised the bbc showed this movie if that s the case br br there are some <UNK> in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot but it s something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years a very good looking movie that s very dumb
<START> justin goes home to live with his strict hard <UNK> police detective father but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three <UNK> apartments each with bizarre <UNK> <UNK> in them straight laced <UNK> justin is thrust into the world of the occult murder under aged drinking and other <UNK> things ho hum br br wow have i seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw clever compelling original intense clever genius i witnessed none of those things what i did see was an uninteresting bland trite extremely clich√©d low budget thriller that was <UNK> with <UNK> and no tension in the least bit as the killer is <UNK> as soon into the film as he gives his monologue debate discussion and where are these humorous laugh out loud moments i never so much as <UNK> perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film br br my grade d br br dvd extras audio commentary with director dave <UNK> second commentary with various <UNK> as well as isolated music tracks 4 <UNK> making of on the set turning 1 room into 4 inside the black circle interviews with <UNK> rose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brown alternate scenes <UNK> a music video for <UNK> a trailer for this movie and trailers for shock o <UNK> chainsaw sally skin crawl <UNK> <UNK> creature from the <UNK> <UNK> millennium <UNK>
<START> i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype i was surprised at the <UNK> of the <UNK> image in my mind the next day and the day after that i've watched it 3 4 times and each time i appreciate it even more the settings are gorgeous the town at <UNK> has beautiful lighting effects the <UNK> long shots and the house itself is <UNK> grown with moss the main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily <UNK> with to the person who complained that there wasn't enough <UNK> in this film i'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being <UNK> by just this one person it is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life spoilers discussion br br i especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost he describes the woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him the other man says you can't go back alone and lends the hero his dog the cute little dog offers a small <UNK> of comic relief with it's <UNK> through the house and even into the locked room br br the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out the woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house this is all in the very beginning another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral as the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the <UNK> the older man won't even look at it but the kids are all yelling and <UNK> it <UNK> usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people as has been mentioned the <UNK> <UNK> and wrath are frightening and i feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified the ending <UNK> the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well i have been <UNK> the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film and it is <UNK> to see others feel the same i can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype br br i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man <UNK> i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the <UNK> <UNK> yeah any other films to recommend br br thanks
<START> panic is kind of a crime comedy drama with william h macy donald sutherland and <UNK> campbell in the leading roles alex played by macy is a guy who kills people for living but for the moment he's facing a depression and that's why he is seeing a <UNK> that's where he meets sarah <UNK> campbell and he falls in love with her he's also facing another problem he wants to quit the family business the killings but he doesn't now how to tell this to his father br br what follows is the story of a guy during he's <UNK> crisis facing the regular problems falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that goes with that br br pretty good acting performances by the cast macy is excellent as the depressed alex i had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie but he doesn't completely deliver the story was rather flat and clich√© br br 7 10
<START> things to come is indeed a classic work of <UNK> fiction both an <UNK> on the destructive nature of war and the <UNK> of progress it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later but is woefully naive in it's <UNK> ideals br br raymond massey cedric <UNK> and ralph richardson make up a fine cast although the drama is played more as a stage piece than a work of cinema there are <UNK> if somewhat stilted speeches often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater however there are some profound words there is technology the <UNK> of mankind or the <UNK> of its destruction the film is a visual feast if one can <UNK> <UNK> from the age of the effects sure hollywood is more sophisticated today but rarely as inventive for the imaginative the third act is a treat a world with underground cities massive <UNK> <UNK> space <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and secret <UNK> of scientist <UNK> it has all of the <UNK> of a sci fi pulp adventure but instead uses the <UNK> for a philosophical exercise br br things to come and metropolis were the <UNK> of <UNK> hollywood science fiction cinema they are operatic in scope and visually inspiring technology has long left them behind but their ideas still burst forth there is an artistry there one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass produced cinema of today these films are the products of <UNK> not <UNK>
<START> released in 1965 but clearly shot years earlier this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept <UNK> up front as usual for <UNK> flicks of era there's a fair amount of <UNK> and dressing for no reason <UNK> by lousy music annoying narration and awkward editing the coffee shop scene lays the excruciating <UNK> as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines all we get are reaction shots to the off screen character's voice 50s pretty misty <UNK> <UNK> to her french cut <UNK> a couple of times before the action gets started she's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother does the <UNK> mixed randomly to produce among other things the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film watch as he <UNK> it watch as he strikes the match will he <UNK> or will he be captured by <UNK> only time will tell the film tells the <UNK> tale of how sally gets tricked into working in a <UNK> falls for a <UNK> and can't escape for some reason we're treated to some of the most bored and boring <UNK> ever committed to film literally doing their nails or <UNK> rather than entertaining the <UNK> some <UNK> lame comedy <UNK> dame accidentally drinks milk <UNK> dee <UNK> and silent film acting doesn't help this is one of the worst feature films i've ever seen even on the something weird video <UNK> it's really more of a film curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema very bad cinema
<START> well they say <UNK> leaves you <UNK> i don't know if stella james sean young qualifies as a <UNK> <UNK> but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men she's still exploring trying to find more data so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now i can't agree however with anyone who says young is too old for the role if she is we should all age so nicely for the most part this film left me cold though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see and unlike the recent <UNK> wide shut ' at least something happens in this one
<START> an unusually straight faced <UNK> played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously <UNK> as is to be expected from a film clearly shot on a tight budget but the drama is involving it's one of those films that when it gets repeated ad <UNK> on <UNK> 2 or more max or whatever they call it you end up watching 40 minute <UNK> when you're supposed to be going to work along w deathstalker 2 <UNK> mall and the assault a reminder that <UNK> is a much more talented director than many of his fellow low budget <UNK> who has a real ability to pace a genre film when he <UNK> interested in the material i e don't bother watching any of his shannon <UNK> flicks with a 3 or a 4 after the title actors who've had too little to do recently <UNK> ford even gary sandy for <UNK> really put their all into some of their best roles in years as for <UNK> he has the right look although his acting is a bit one note it's clear his character is supposed to be self <UNK> throughout the film but <UNK> doesn't quite convey it i checked imdb and i see the writer also wrote <UNK> house massacre 2 dinosaur island for the director both minor classics in their own rights but obviously silly roger <UNK> like cinema this one's more like some of the better jonathan <UNK> and jonathan <UNK> b pictures of the 70's giving you the exploitation element but offering involving drama at the same time a real step forward not citizen kane and the comic final moments are a bit <UNK> but a well written character driven above average straight to video <UNK> small achievements like this should not be overlooked when they come along which is rare enough as i was reminded as i tried to sit through an albert <UNK> monstrosity called <UNK> the other night this low budget stuff isn't as easy as it looks but that's another story
<START> it is a story of <UNK> village people from the beginning of 20th century till the <UNK> it is about passion and feelings about russian soul and very romantic this movie is not action packed it <UNK> <UNK> in second part one can find great songs russian romances it is much more better than doctor <UNK> the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example
<START> a bondage <UNK> s m show and not much else the plot is flat really just a banal setup for the <UNK> <UNK> set pieces the host of the aforementioned show a silly little man who <UNK> drivel while <UNK> around the stage in dresses was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at <UNK> editing the dream like ending felt tacked on to the film's credit though <UNK> <UNK> was fairly convincing as the tortured lead flower and snake has been compared with eyes wide shut but aside from some minor surface similarities kubrick's is easily the more layered artistic and atmospheric picture
<START> serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in <UNK> with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine <UNK> fiction known as chapter plays they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called chapters or episodes each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week the serial would end with a cliffhanger as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest <UNK> situation from which there could be no escape br br the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again serials were especially popular with children and for many children in the first half of the 20th century a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial along with animated cartoons <UNK> and two feature films br br the golden age for serials was 1936 1945 this was one of the best of the era br br zorro has been seen in many films but reed hadley <UNK> squad the <UNK> brain was excellent in the role br br the action is constant and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the <UNK> br br zorro <UNK> as he always does
<START> as a guy who has seen all the seasons i can say that <UNK> constantly surprises me i mean after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster u thought to yourself ok he is a good actor and he can get into a <UNK> skin but after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life i mean i could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through i was so touched by his performance that i immediately thought at robert de niro marlon brando and al pacino these guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more but nowadays they are either old or dead brando and it's ok that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be i can't wait to see gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
<START> this is one of the funnier films i've seen it had it's crude moments but they were full of charm it's <UNK> screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve <UNK> <UNK> i truly was surprisingly this is a good natured <UNK> comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine <UNK> was terrific as <UNK> and all of steve <UNK> friends were flawed but <UNK> and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended
<START> <UNK> does it again next to pixar <UNK> animation proves again and again how to do animation properly br br i had a great time watching the first episode of creature <UNK> i thought it translated well for american audiences my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show br br having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this the animators did a great job matching up pre recorded voices to a perfect match animal look at the first episode with the goat who sounds stoned and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other <UNK> br br is this for everyone not by a long shot in fact i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season but like i said before audiences aren't going to get it
<START> the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant i love it all the story lines are so good and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other their problems were real and it really drew you into the show the show is basically about this family called 'the <UNK> and their lives the family consisted of <UNK> day mum jack day dad natalie day <UNK> daughter cooper day <UNK> son and nathan day boy genius son each episodes a day of their life with <UNK> perspective on things throughout it i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great he was by far my favorite character it ended with so many things it could've continued with i'm really sad another season wasn't made it was a great show i'm gonna miss it
<START> i caught this movie about 8 years ago and have never had it of my mind surely someone out there will release it on video or hey why not dvd the ford <UNK> is the star if you have any head for cars watch this and be blown away
<START> <UNK> von <UNK> directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former <UNK> general to the <UNK> of russia who has found himself there <UNK> <UNK> won a well deserved oscar in part for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country's fall to <UNK> william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts <UNK> in his film the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind the scenes <UNK> in the early days von <UNK> delivers yet another classic and one that is filled with the great elements of romance intrigue and tragedy
<START> at a risk of sounding slightly <UNK> on first viewing i'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with <UNK> of the <UNK> now given i view simon pegg as an <UNK> comedy genius i realise this is a rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good <UNK> <UNK> of whether <UNK> will appeal to you br br in a way the comedy picks up where <UNK> left off except we're back in the original 1950s living dead era stereotypical middle american small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well <UNK> useful members of the community this so we're informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at <UNK> a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br the beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of a respectable <UNK> maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special <UNK> they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from a more mainstream <UNK> comedy come through the <UNK> of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled <UNK> values social <UNK> and the plight of the <UNK> individual br br it's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all round strong cast it's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part it's also fun imagining what billy <UNK> learning his script must have been like br br so in conclusion it is <UNK> you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you
<START> is there any other time period that has been so <UNK> covered by television or the media in general as the 1960s no and do we really need yet another trip through that <UNK> time not really but if we must have one does it have to be as shallow as the '60s br br i like to think that co writers bill <UNK> and robert <UNK> had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted especially given <UNK> involvement in the superb hbo movie dear america letters home from vietnam which <UNK> little original music and no original footage letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves this presentation <UNK> file footage with the dramatic production but it doesn't do anyone any <UNK> by trying to do too much in too little time like so many of its <UNK> it's seen from the point of view of one family but the children of the family seem to be involved <UNK> with almost every major event of the '60s it's amazing that one of them doesn't go to the rolling stones gig at <UNK> making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade br br the makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time the children's father is especially clich√©d and then when they're back on <UNK> it's something else <UNK> <UNK> could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly in fairness jerry <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jeremy <UNK> julia stiles and charles s <UNK> give their material the old college try but they're wasted especially the latter two it's undeniably good to see david alan <UNK> in a rare straight role as <UNK> fred <UNK> and <UNK> arquette in an uncredited cameo in part 2 is always welcome br br what isn't welcome is how the '60s <UNK> the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately <UNK> its already minimal effect and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post 60s america never mentions the british invasion no beatles no rolling stones then again there's only so much tunes you can <UNK> into a soundtrack album right <UNK> its surface <UNK> approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending american dreams and the wonder years did it all much much better nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere people except for julia stiles doing the twist that is
<START> eight academy nominations it's beyond belief i can only think it was a very bad year even by hollywood standards with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have <UNK> the bait and watched this anyway but the oscar nominations really sold it to me and i feel distinctly cheated as a result br br so it's a black comedy is it can anyone tell me where the humour is in <UNK> honor it's certainly tasteless the shooting in the head of a <UNK> wife is but another supposedly comic <UNK> in this intended farce about mafia life but with the exception of a joke about <UNK> favourite mexican <UNK> which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last 50 years i failed to spot anything of a comic nature and i did try there is a lot of mafia clich√© but clich√© doesn't <UNK> humour in my book br br is it a romantic comedy of sorts never the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben <UNK> and jennifer lopez in <UNK> br br is it a cleverly <UNK> parody about the mafia not in a million years the plot is just <UNK> absurd rather than <UNK> absurd and it usually just has the feel of a really bad and cheap mafia movie it feels more like a homage than a parody br br with one dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces well it isn't enough even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression jack nicholson <UNK> with <UNK> up top lip now is that meant to be a parody of <UNK> padded <UNK> in the godfather oh who cares all i know is it isn't funny br br throw in some slow plodding direction this film drags on for 2 hours some hopelessly <UNK> and clich√©d dialogue such as you remember the <UNK> well we're far bigger we'll track you down wherever you go and clich√©d mannerisms and you'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say <UNK> <UNK> honor is far from being <UNK> masterpiece and is rather a very poor last work it's definitely one work in the great director's <UNK> that should be given a <UNK> <UNK> and tossed into the hudson river
<START> usually any film with <UNK> stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that <UNK> stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is <UNK> unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didn't enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the <UNK> award for worst picture i would give this a 3 10 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough
<START> this story is told and <UNK> and continues to be <UNK> in every possibly way imagine the immortal charles <UNK> story has been <UNK> in every possible way imagine i admit i have not seen the classic <UNK> <UNK> version and i'm sure someday i will but i would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version i believe that if dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it br br the story is well known i won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another a rich <UNK> mean old man is visited by the ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways in order to <UNK> him out he is visited by three spirits each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with past present and future finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts <UNK> for all the wrong he has done br br george c scott is absolutely undeniably perfect for this role he takes hold of the <UNK> scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character he is not just a mean old man but someone who has been <UNK> by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world there is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to scrooge br br not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place this is a grand epic of victorian england dickens england is <UNK> before our very eyes the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the <UNK> in your face and the <UNK> of the market director clive <UNK> brilliantly <UNK> this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination i could watch this film on mute and be <UNK> by the scenery it's not spectacular scenery per se but it's real the film takes us from the high class <UNK> market to the very dismal <UNK> of poverty and everything in between br br the rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life bob <UNK> played by david warner and his entire family including and especially the young tiny tim played by anthony <UNK> were wonderful the ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story a christmas carol is not a light story dickens wrote this story for a dark period in <UNK> life and it's one of the few christmas tales that is really dark almost scary and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a <UNK> for so many years into turning around the dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures christmas <UNK> the score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it's the actual score or the christmas music everything fits together apparently christmas movies are my favorite because i insist everyone see this christmas carol above all others 10 10
<START> what an unusual movie br br absolutely no <UNK> are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced sound br br facial expressions are usually covered by thick <UNK> and the spanish language is a strange <UNK> <UNK> that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a <UNK> br br i sort of viewed these movies parts 1 and 2 as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dull br br but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i don't think its very educational either br br its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why che's band was moving around the way they did as a result there seem to be groups <UNK> around the <UNK> for no particular reason and getting shot at br br i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow <UNK> more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is a sort of <UNK> valley p t a with touches of the supernatural elvira <UNK> peterson walks off her job as television horror movie <UNK> after the new <UNK> owner gets fresh with her she's now relying on a las vegas show to carry her through but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her <UNK> death which then takes elvira to <UNK> for the reading of the will a house in need of <UNK> a dog and a <UNK> are all that is left to her by her aunt and again it seems elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the las vegas show the adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for elvira only the local hunk daniel greene and a group of teenagers will <UNK> her <UNK> uncle <UNK> w morgan <UNK> <UNK> to make a deal with elvira for the <UNK> but elvira soon learns of her powerful <UNK> that includes <UNK> and a couple very effective <UNK> elvira no longer wants to sell the <UNK> to her uncle but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town's old charge of witchcraft and the showdown between her and her uncle the plot is pretty simple but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace elvira mistress of the dark is full of cute gross <UNK> and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags <UNK> props songs and parodies the film's touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made it is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers including edie <UNK> and jeff <UNK> of grease there are also nice special effects many people including myself wondered if the elvira character could carry a feature film and the answer is delightfully yes
<START> if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a <UNK> piece of big screen art the actors and the direction of this film are both good br br the only trouble with the film as i can see it is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood's <UNK> at the time this film was shot br br given both the <UNK> of today's movies as well as the <UNK> and <UNK> today's audiences to delve into the bizarre i think even <UNK> would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released

<START> this was the worst movie i saw at <UNK> and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it's great to see j <UNK> but she's only in the movie for a few minutes m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the 90s and not even a good one in those standards br br
<START> vampire <UNK> rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a <UNK> <UNK> kris kristofferson and a warrior woman <UNK> long as they face off against lance <UNK> and gary daniels who play the <UNK> in this ridiculous movie of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie the most poignant is who's idea was it to cast country singer kris kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets no don't get me wrong i could see kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg strangely one suspects that this was written for dolph lundgren however lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it however despite the disastrous casting kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie he gives a performance far more human then the <UNK> kathy long and kristofferson is playing a robot despite the <UNK> kristofferson provides the few moments of interest lance <UNK> is <UNK> and gary daniels is wasted but basically knights is <UNK> failure you stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper this is a movie where a <UNK> kristofferson is fighting robots in a <UNK> worst of all it ends in a what if sequel thankfully this has yet to <UNK> although i still have nightmares at the <UNK> of the <UNK> of such an event br br out of 4 bad
<START> i saw this movie while it was under limited release mainly for the novelty of seeing pierce brosnan with a <UNK> but it turned out to be one of the funniest movies i have seen all year it starts out almost as a thriller but <UNK> progresses into a hilarious piece of work full of one liners and great comedic energy between pierce brosnan and greg kinnear also while i say this movie is a comedy it doesn't forget it has a heart at times and can be very touching when it needs to be when i went into the theater i didn't know what to expect much more than a <UNK> but what i got was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time leaving the theater i felt very <UNK> from the film and plan to see it again in wide release i recommend it to anyone who <UNK> a good comedy with a well written script and a big <UNK>
<START> this <UNK> of anthony <UNK> classic play did not last long in cinemas having recently suffered through it on cable i still <UNK> myself for not wasting money on a ticket director kenneth branagh writer harold <UNK> and star producer jude law <UNK> themselves that their <UNK> alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable <UNK> minutes without the fun or class of the longer original br br michael caine enhanced his reputation playing the second lead in the marvelous 1972 film he now seems intent on destroying it by attempting the lead played in that version by laurence olivier both were nominated for best actor oscars but lost to marlon brando in the godfather looking <UNK> and washed out caine <UNK> through the part with less depth than he displays as <UNK> butler he had already <UNK> himself to a guest appearance in the atrocious remake of get carter what's next <UNK> ii or son of the man who would be king br br but then no one benefits from this inane adaptation by <UNK> who thinks that frequent <UNK> and an added sexual angle can compensate for the absence of <UNK> witty character interplay branagh's direction relies on <UNK> lighting and a soulless set design that wouldn't hold up in a second rate nightclub neither the shadows nor the tight <UNK> close ups can help law overcome his dull screen persona the result is a failure both as straight drama and as detective thriller almost making you forget the purpose behind the title br br fans of the original stage production with anthony <UNK> and keith <UNK> and the olivier caine film would do well to regard this enterprise as a bad dream the late mr <UNK> who wrote the 1972 screenplay as well as hitchcock's frenzy and several agatha christie adaptations must be turning in his grave wishing he could plan a real murder or two
<START> follows the usual formula in putting a new <UNK> this time the first african american cuba gooding after president truman <UNK> the armed forces through the u s <UNK> deep sea diver training program that is run by a racist <UNK> robert deniro if the program weren't bad enough it's got to be located in <UNK> new jersey br br there's nothing wrong with the performances robert de niro <UNK> his southern accent and shouts <UNK> effectively cuba gooding raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south is the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the girls one could hardly call them women are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense other decent performers powers <UNK> and hal <UNK> have even more <UNK> roles br br that's about it almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer a ship is called a boat robert de niro <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after a brutal assault on hospital <UNK> he's transferred out of his outfit instead of being <UNK> somebody shouts i'm outta here in the early 1950s maybe it was a common expression at the time if so my bad people address each other by rank lieutenant <UNK> mate commander as they do in the army whereas in the navy they are simple mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if <UNK> i didn't bother to check if there was a rank called senior master chief in 1950 br br cuba gooding has a tough row to <UNK> everyone in the navy it seems hates <UNK> except for one guy from <UNK> he <UNK> and is held in contempt by the others in his class it's like the scene in animal house in which the <UNK> to a tony <UNK> is asked to wait in a room with a <UNK> a black man and a blind kid br br gooding is an <UNK> man a second class petty officer he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just <UNK> from medical school in one of their arguments she <UNK> with him she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her quit the navy and lead a quiet life and just let life pass you by he <UNK> yes yes just be a doctor's <UNK> and let life pass you by you can wave to it from the golf course in <UNK> <UNK> br br these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that sort of thing cheap as they often were they had some educational features you learned something about becoming a <UNK> or a <UNK> here the technical details are <UNK> over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except <UNK> law which we learned in high school chemistry br br i couldn't follow what was happening during some of the <UNK> without which a movie like this wouldn't exist if i got the mechanical problems right it was because i guessed correctly the direction is no help either the movie <UNK> in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had and the <UNK> are confusing because they're ill focused br br why go on want to see a better example of this kind of movie almost any will do except maybe g i jane in which the abused hero is a heroin try the training camp scenes in the young lions there the victim is a jew or try from here to eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like cool hand luke no easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy br br thoroughly formulaic and not well done
<START> madison is not too bad <UNK> you like simplistic non offensive family friendly fare and more importantly if you know absolutely nothing about <UNK> <UNK> racing if like me you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc prepare to be disappointed br br professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its <UNK> for <UNK> every hackneyed sports clich√© in the book i <UNK> repeat what they've said what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of <UNK> <UNK> racing in the glory years which many would argue were already past in 1971 br br yes it was wonderful to see the old classic <UNK> roaring down the course six <UNK> though it was clear that the restored versions hats off to the <UNK> at the <UNK> and race boat museum were being <UNK> through the scenes at reduced speed but where was the sound much of the thrill of the old <UNK> was the mind numbing <UNK> of six allison or rolls <UNK> aircraft <UNK> wound up to <UNK> never imagined by their <UNK> hitting the starting line right in front of you you didn't hear it you felt it real <UNK> buffs know exactly what i'm talking about there's none of that in madison instead every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a heroic musical score br br and then there are the close up shots of the drivers riding smoothly and <UNK> in the <UNK> as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury <UNK> in some cases taking time to smile <UNK> as they contemplate how best to <UNK> the poor home town hero or in one particularly ridiculous shot taking time to spot jake lloyd giving a rocky <UNK> from a bridge <UNK> in reality some <UNK> drivers wore <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> the beating they took as the <UNK> <UNK> across the rock hard water at <UNK> above 150 <UNK> br br as one reviewer so <UNK> put it the sport deserves better than this br br finally since another user brought up <UNK> i'll add one the establishing shot of seattle shows the <UNK> and <UNK> field neither existed in 1971
<START> it's difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because i think the problem begins with the books themselves alexander <UNK> smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely <UNK> vision of an africa that does not exist he's done for <UNK> what <UNK> did for <UNK> not as successfully but based in as much fact br br once i realised this it <UNK> to <UNK> me that jill scott an american singer actress is cast as <UNK> <UNK> if she is to represent a land that is not africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not african she's not the only american on the cast <UNK> <UNK> is played by <UNK> <UNK> rose both women are far far too young for the roles they're playing and far too glamorous both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting scott's <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> cute and soft <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an annoying <UNK> mouthed bitch br br the result is almost unwatchable the principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of <UNK> <UNK> who turns in a decent performance as mr <UNK> <UNK> hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but i find myself unable to blame <UNK> for this he's a shining light in an ocean of <UNK> the <UNK> between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> wrote the script br br to me <UNK> smith's writing has always been highly entertaining yet <UNK> bad he refuses to be edited as a result his books contain experiments in <UNK> that border on the scientific and characters that change name mid sentence it is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse br br the dialogue is now largely <UNK> characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs <UNK> <UNK> and mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> openly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about not having a computer but given her constantly <UNK> hair makeup and <UNK> i'm surprised she doesn't have a <UNK> in her <UNK> along with her <UNK> card br br so what are we left with here it's difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things i like about the original books are <UNK> anyway <UNK> smith paints a fictional <UNK> populated with cute non threatening black people who are full of amusing and <UNK> wisdom <UNK> it reads well despite <UNK> travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were it just isn't true br br given that it's hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does it remains to be seen whether european and american audiences will even notice however
<START> i read the comment of chris m grant from united states br br he wrote a fantastic documentary of <UNK> this early 20th century <UNK> of today's iraq was powerful br br i would like to thank chris and people who are interested in <UNK> <UNK> of iran the <UNK> mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a <UNK> battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life <UNK> i am from this region of iran myself i am a <UNK> br br chris i am sorry to bother you but <UNK> region of <UNK> is in iran not in <UNK> as you mentioned in your comment iran and <UNK> are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an <UNK> is almost like taking an american for an mexican thanks br br <UNK>
<START> serious home alone karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer <UNK> and then shot you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene oh and the acting sucks too although i must say that the line sorry dude i have to take a major dump big time made me laugh my ass off
<START> i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic <UNK> that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet that and it had nicole kidman in it i absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking <UNK> br br <UNK> down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few <UNK> at each corner the relationships in the film are <UNK> with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully the humour is subtle with some great <UNK> like scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood br br overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation it's less about <UNK> and more about delicate relationships brit filmmaking at its best br br 9 10
<START> considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still <UNK> watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
<START> don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks <UNK> it's <UNK> about the japanese <UNK> industry which morally is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish <UNK> <UNK> it stinks <UNK> it's pretentious <UNK> the sort of up its own behind <UNK> that gets modern art a bad name that said there are some stunning images but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being <UNK> and then just when you thinks it's finished it starts again i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show <UNK> film works which is an admirable and clever way to <UNK> what had once been a local <UNK> from the dirty old men in <UNK> <UNK> but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard <UNK> <UNK> fans were to be honest everyone might have had a lot more fun if they'd just shown one of the <UNK>
