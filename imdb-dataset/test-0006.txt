<START> this movie is about a group of women perhaps not of the highest <UNK> who are heading to a small <UNK> to take over a recently <UNK> <UNK> property where they plan to set up shop upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there even though its only 15 miles away so they walk when they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the <UNK> and built up a small city nearby they soon find that something isn't right here and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doom as the locals call it is in some serious trouble br br rather than go into the plot line i will make some comments about things i noticed about the movie first off the acting is very flat only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in my first though was poor acting but at the end i watched some of the <UNK> and these same people became alive so my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it on top of the bad acting i have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances take for example no one would take them to <UNK> <UNK> for any price even though its only 15 miles away yet when we arrive at the <UNK> we find it is well <UNK> by a decent population of people all of whom must get supplies from some one not to mention mail etc it is supposed to take place in yet we can see the <UNK> car has electric lights they aren't on at least and a <UNK> engine that is at least 30 years later not one of the general style of so popular at that time there are also places where you can see <UNK> <UNK> and maybe a car at one point didn't want to bother to go back and look and other <UNK> items if they had followed the rules of the world they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 i gave it and they <UNK> it about 4 more times it might have done even better
<START> i saw this film purely by chance it was shown very late or more correctly very early one morning on television i had <UNK> up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on br br it deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere it certainly isn't as good as <UNK> rita despite a couple of additional twists and has a very predictable ending br br despite its very obvious shortcomings i did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole br br i am a big fan of sam neil and have seen him in many different films including dead calm the piano <UNK> children of the revolution event horizon man and the <UNK> jurassic park he was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut br br some of the acting was in my opinion dreadful rose <UNK> for example and some of the <UNK> were rather heavy handed all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example br br however two actors who i hadn't or don't remember seen before impressed me a lot as frances frank kennedy and especially matthew <UNK> as her son david he in particular was very convincing and i would like to see a lot more of him
<START> the cell is an exotic masterpiece a <UNK> trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer but also into one of a very talented director this is <UNK> evidence of what can be achieved if human beings <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> this is <UNK> at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into <UNK> and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date br br i've read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to <UNK> criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director <UNK> that we don't want any more personally i would more than welcome another movie by and would love to see someone try to challenge him br br we've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer and yes i do agree that the genre is a bit <UNK> the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers <UNK> some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not <UNK> down the same trail we are given a new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied br br i like how the movie does not <UNK> us down with too much scientific <UNK> trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long <UNK> and into another <UNK> the cell wants to let you see what it's all about and not how it's all about and i guess that's what some people don't like true i do like explanations with my movies but when a movie <UNK> onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in br br i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing i wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture br br i've noticed that i've kind of been repeating myself not because there's nothing else to say but because i can't stress enough how fantastic i thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time i guess this film was just a little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater i heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs if so i want what he was smoking br br out of 4
<START> is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones it features a kid sized story of longing and love with <UNK> <UNK> but it is not preachy <UNK> miyazaki has <UNK> <UNK> little mermaid with <UNK> native <UNK> and his trademark steam punk <UNK> of fancy and the result is very rewarding there are some scary moments of <UNK> and <UNK> but they are thrilling not horrific br br if you've ever wanted to run with the waves along the shore ride on a <UNK> as an elevator completely <UNK> yourself or make a friend for life is a fable for you
<START> peter <UNK> 1995 commercial hit now cult classic <UNK> is a hilarious film an <UNK> entertainer chris <UNK> is a talent which we'll never ever forget br br <UNK> is a simple story told in the funniest zany way possible <UNK> spade take a journey which is filled with <UNK> laughter even the rob lowe portion is damn funny as a kid i remember watching <UNK> again and again and again it's been of my childhood favorites and it will always remain to be even today when it comes on t v i stick to it as a die hard fan i am quite <UNK> about this film br br <UNK> direction is super chris <UNK> might have died in 1997 but remains alive for me at least what an actor watch his work in <UNK> he's so much at ease he delivered fantastic performances later on in films like hills <UNK> <UNK> but his work in here remains as his best to date love you <UNK> spade on the other hand is as good as ever he's an excellent actor in all respects br br <UNK> rules 100 thumbs up from this writer
<START> just watched this movie over the weekend and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it the 2 <UNK> american actors are excellent as usual michael <UNK> and john <UNK> it is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by italians primarily he was influenced by <UNK> and his film <UNK> it is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends one is <UNK> and the other is <UNK> they enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine <UNK> the same thing happens to albert de <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of on the run because he uses the same technique but with a twist i had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite if you watch both movies you will understand the other film that influenced the director is after hours directed by the great italian american scorsese i highly recommend all 3 movies
<START> possibly one of the best most horrible b movies ever as in it's so bad and random it's kinda hilarious and i don't know how to feel about it reminds me of cabin fever there's just something about that kid jumping off the <UNK> doing karate and yelling that's intriguing since a lot of people have already <UNK> the plot and everything all i'm going to do is sum up the quality of the movie with one quote i'm the park ranger who's going to f <UNK> you up yeah enough said if you're looking for quality or a really scary movie i don't recommend it but if you like these sorts of films then i guess you would enjoy it i don't know how but i guess some people would
<START> i don't know what <UNK> the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in but i'm glad i'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish <UNK> of this thing okay we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the die hard series but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang with a <UNK> as a <UNK> yet c'mon all she needed was a bald head and a ripped t shirt and she would be bruce willis br br apparently jodie being the executive producer <UNK> her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black or hispanic even the dog is black little <UNK> is the only good one and except for a black police officer everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her has your fear of your acting talent <UNK> so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot literally on camera in a dark <UNK> and somber neighborhood film cast apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie the dark knight br br ridiculous plot holes furniture chewing acting gratuitous violence look girls now you can do it too spend the time with your family instead of watching this <UNK>
<START> this low budget film about a writer who goes to work in a london casino has an awful script wooden performances and not much to recommend it of course it will appeal to <UNK> for whom mainstream is a curse word and who automatically add 20 iq points when they hear a british accent apologies to jeff <UNK> br br the script is full of holes has he written a book yet or not cliches relationship trouble she works days he works nights and provides so little insight into such <UNK> as character motivation that it requires a voice over narration just to move the story along br br in an attempt to keep the audience from <UNK> off it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of <UNK> <UNK> br br if your idea of <UNK> dialogue is i'll see your ten and raise you twenty then run to see this movie otherwise save your money br br
<START> okay wait let me get this street there are actually some morons on this site who <UNK> this is one of the better if not the best halloween sequel i even read someone saying it was just as good as the original <UNK> what nonsense don't believe them i've watched every halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of s is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life frankly if i was john carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle seriously halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish two was crap three was stupid four is alright five is well five <UNK> alright <UNK> painful yet in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels why well let me just <UNK> on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why halloween 6 the cure of michael myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time ok where should i start ah yes the plot oh boy the plot basically the plot is a <UNK> together mess containing <UNK> signs of <UNK> and some other crap it's just stupid it really is the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet its <UNK> together in such a horribly made way why does michael myers got to have a reason for killing people simple enough explanation <UNK> likes to kill his relatives that would suffice but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious <UNK> and signs of <UNK> and utter crap god its so bad it made me want to cry it really did the writers have tried to add to the character of myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite apart from wearing a mask and a <UNK> suit which is a completely different colour by the way myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two heck maybe even four thats another thing why has myers become a jason parody i thought it was meant to be the other way round yet myers is so similar to jason all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways in the original he <UNK> his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful in this he just walks around <UNK> people to death i mean in the space of half an hour we had <UNK> the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous oh and myers in this seems to have a really big head i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight what else is crap oh yeah the return of tommy <UNK> thats pretty bad in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar dr <UNK> of course i can't stand the little kid i wish he had got it he's really irritating our heroin is boring and not interesting and her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors the mother is rubbish the brother is bad and the father i mean was this his first part or something he was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than myers by the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable what else is rubbish oh yeah tommy <UNK> don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him i wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really there is dr <UNK> a horribly aged and <UNK> donald <UNK> by all account despite him being on his last legs <UNK> is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this what else is rubbish oh yeah the bit where the radio dj gets it firstly how the hell did michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film
<START> cliche romance drama movie with very simple plot but very good cinematography and script the screenplay directing and acting was also good the flow of the movie is kind of manipulative in order to bring the audience to tears through the excellent love music and <UNK> which works but later on after the movie makes one feel raped in a way jones makes her character very memorable and lovable though a deeper story could have taken this movie to a higher level but still the movie delivers for it's genre only for hopeless <UNK> big love story fans big soap drama fans 50's <UNK> cinematography fans and fans of the lead actors
<START> if b movies tired and corny scripts and golf <UNK> dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment you'll probably enjoy this otherwise forget it the topless though completely irrelevant did give a few seconds of amusement
<START> savage guns video title is a dirt cheap bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre <UNK> the <UNK> who killed his brother and left him for dead catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss br br despite plenty of violence this manages to be both dull and <UNK> with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor br br lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and <UNK> performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever in other words the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he's the protagonist br br the worst scene in my opinion is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly <UNK> german accent it was the worst scene in blazing <UNK> and the worst one here
<START> hey now i have never laid eyes on a manga comic but apparently this movie is based on one ah well such is life anyway this is a pretty bizarre to say the least movie as things literally spiral out of control in a small japanese town people are becoming obsessed with the spiral and this young girl watches her friend's father <UNK> a <UNK> and later in the movie people start becoming <UNK> it also seems this boy's dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household <UNK> there is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a tim burton movie but there is some <UNK> gore like only the japanese can do with justice as with a lot of japanese films though the ending is the ending and did anything get resolved well not to my mind it didn't there are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren't explored and there's a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn't deemed important still though there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren't obsessed with everything making perfect sense this is well worth seeing because it's just so original and bizarre my favorite was the father with the spinning <UNK> personally 8 out of 10 stars
<START> this might have been an excellent flick however as many other people think so do i it is poorly done due to the languages transfer if the entire movie must be read then it kind of takes away from the movie and becomes something else it does have an excellent rating as far as i am concerned and i couldn't wait to rent it but once i did it was a real let down out here in <UNK> <UNK> i could not find an english version to anything similar this movie was also compared to dark hours and this we will not get to watch in <UNK> <UNK> it is not available so i guess we will never know how good the movie actually was
<START> are very good movie she happen on a mental home in <UNK> e is in a leading role and is good other good actors in this movie are and i like this movie she is very good i voice with this movie
<START> wow it's hard to put into words my feelings for this episode ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure it's my favorite of the season six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the <UNK> with an unknown <UNK> that causes murderous <UNK> the drama can't get any better than that paranoia <UNK> supreme as even <UNK> and <UNK> have doubts about each other's sanity i've heard people complain about this <UNK> similarities to the movie 'the <UNK> i haven't seen it so i wouldn't know ice is more than worth watching just to see <UNK> and <UNK> truly testing their still developing trust of one another this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end you won't be disappointed
<START> i have a completely biased point of view mainly because i live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle being a dj and frequent club goer i see the honesty within this movie and i love it if you don't know the club rave culture then it will be a great <UNK> into that culture for anyone that doesn't know it first hand the honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of <UNK> i loved the characters were well constructed and i thoroughly enjoyed this film i really don't enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this web site i will write at least 6 or 7 but i feel that i can portray my point with fewer than ten here are some extra lines to make the imdb gods happy
<START> i am very impressed by the reviews i've read of this film generally well read thoughtful and informed obviously by people who like and think hard about films i couldn't add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that imdb members have already done if i may i'd like to correct a small but <UNK> <UNK> that appears in many of the reviews mr baseball was american and <UNK> in an ugly fashion but he was not an ugly american the original ugly american was homer <UNK> one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by and <UNK> and the exact opposite of mr baseball homer was an <UNK> american and an <UNK> engineer he went to vietnam to work with people he respected and liked the people he met he used appropriate <UNK> technology in <UNK> with his <UNK> and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he <UNK> <UNK> values and american virtues his <UNK> was purely facial merely skin deep his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine br br mr baseball <UNK> all the crass ignorant insecure that we europeans and americans so often <UNK> on other cultures homer <UNK> the ugly american was the other side of our <UNK> representing our humanity and decency i believe that the ugly americans still far <UNK> the mr <UNK> they are still our last best hope
<START> i've seen many horror splatter monster movies in my life and of course also a lot of monster movies from the 50's and 60's when i first stumbled over this one i thought this is from the 60's until i recognized it's from 2007 br br in fact the character of jack <UNK> is interesting and the acting all in all is for a splatter movie quite good but i expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about a aggressive plummer the movie runs 80 and i think the first kill is after <UNK> minutes although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a in my opinion not that well managed splatter sequence although we have robert englund starring here i only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans
<START> yeah that's right if i were to ask my friends this question what's the worst movie you have ever seen they might <UNK> something like <UNK> can you <UNK> the hole <UNK> plan nine from outer space the <UNK> scooby doo etc no don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human <UNK> that this movie is in if the worst movie you can think of is let's say so bad it really <UNK> you off then you know nothing my friend br br crazy six i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie both of us had already been through most of the movies in there and on the new movies shelf we see it staring at us wow there's some good actors here man says something about mafia lets just get it and get out of here this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life it was also the worst mistake for everybody else movie lover or not br br watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water or ice tea until it reaches room <UNK> watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death if death is just <UNK> light and nothing and then you realize you are just staring at your tv <UNK> not staring you are actually paying as much attention that is <UNK> possible this is no joke br br this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie it's not the kind of bad you can watch point and laugh of its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain hey that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it br br best regards from me to you albert <UNK> br br
<START> <UNK> follow up to <UNK> hits the screen as three short stories set in <UNK> all with a few of trade marks drug culture depression the working class and football club uneasy to watch in places it is no less than very well written 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious and shockingly realistic plot to it will not appeal to most including myself to a point but will no doubt adopt a cult following
<START> my take yet another lame pg 13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot br br the spirits move the walls <UNK> there's something wrong in the basement these along with several other horror movie clichés haunt the walls of yet another house in the country in the sam <UNK> produced the a lame <UNK> of the most predictable scare tactics thrown in on a plot <UNK> recycled from better and sometimes even worse horror movies of the past br br when the <UNK> family moves into an old south <UNK> <UNK> in yet another attempt by dad dylan mcdermott to <UNK> with the family especially with their <UNK> drunk driving daughter jessica the underrated <UNK> stewart in the more subtle countryside than their home in chicago the horror ensues when jessica begins to get little surprise visits from the <UNK> thinking she's some teenage girl who cried wolf her parents don't believe her how could they the real horror in the is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next will it be an angry flock of <UNK> wanting more than the family's <UNK> a direct rip off of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece the birds will it be the haunted house with a history dating back from the <UNK> horror or <UNK> or will it be the grotesque <UNK> taken from your familiar recent horrors like the ring and the grudge heck the movie even manages to rip off a scene or two from some truly bad horror movies like <UNK> 3 d and the mediocre cold creek <UNK> perhaps all the <UNK> brothers really wanted to do was a b level horror movie but did it have to be this bad couldn't they rip off from the best avoid it br br rating out of 5
<START> i have never seen the first <UNK> film and i have also never heard a good thing said about it so i see <UNK> 2 in the local blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back starring <UNK> <UNK> and debbie <UNK> it boasts now being the massive troma fan that i am there is no way i'm not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two in it oh how wrong i was even <UNK> and debbie cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is <UNK> quite frankly stinks as <UNK> although this probably is more the fault of the writers giving him some of the worst one liners in the history of film debbie does put a solid performance in but it isn't enough the kills are terrible as are the gore effects for example check out when the guy is supposedly <UNK> on something or other and just to top it all off the ending is just amongst the worst i have ever seen in movie history the film doesn't even work on a so bad it's good level avoid like the <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> this movie is from the 80s but it looks like it was made in the stone age the effects are way too cheesy my copy has sandra <UNK> on the cover which was why i bought the movie she was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total <UNK> she would most likely deny all involvement br br in short there is no part of this movie worth seeing except to laugh at how bad it sucks rent this to see the worst film ever made bar none
<START> so when i first saw commercials for greek i did have a few questions to how they were going to approach greek life if they were going to give away sacred frat and <UNK> secrets if they were going to focus on the brother and <UNK> a <UNK> or <UNK> brings or what most college kids think of greek life as a huge party br br luckily it covered everything the story plot was great it gave you a character to love hate someone you want to be like someone you don't want to be like and of course a crazy roommate br br it was one of my first looks at what writers believed greek life to be like and i can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead on br br i love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between rusty and his crazy roommate its hard enough moving away from home and being forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know then come to find out you have nothing in common probably every college bound worst nightmare br br sister <UNK> was pretty much the typical girl on campus everyone is jealous of what didn't she have oh thats right <UNK> all to herself rebecca and <UNK> had an affair early into the season which made you feel fairly sympathetic for <UNK> her character evolved and her relationship with rusty became more and more loving and <UNK> br br is one of the most fun loving characters and absolutely insane one of my favorite episodes included him getting completely <UNK> at a strip club and rusty having to call <UNK> to <UNK> them out i like how they addressed the issue of gay people in greek houses <UNK> was a very real feeling character and i really respected him because he stuck to his standards so <UNK> k was fairly crazy but she actually liked rusty it was surprising and i continued to question her from the start but of course i did want it to work out between her and rusty br br i am definitely looking forward to the return of greek it takes you into the truth of greek life something that a lot of people look past one of the biggest things that <UNK> and <UNK> are known for is parties and drinking greek is a great show and the characters are easy to relate to
<START> i was <UNK> up to not like this movie and the first 10 minutes or so did nothing to <UNK> my fears it starts off with 2 high school gangs <UNK> off against each other with bad kung fu a scenario found in countless other korean films ho hum add the fact that the story was written by the same guy who wrote he was cool which was barely passable and well i thought i was in for a <UNK> 2 hours br br but don't give up so quickly a romance of their own was directed by <UNK> kim who also did <UNK> high which i thought was loads of fun anyway romance of their own soon takes a turn much for the better a high school girl just having moved to <UNK> finds herself in the middle of attention from two <UNK> <UNK> each guy has his own merit and it is not clear which one if either would be the right pick br br what follows is not your usual teen love triangle the emotions are complex and while you may not agree with certain choices or actions as the film develops you can certainly understand why the characters make them br br the movie asks questions of the characters and the audience who does one choose at what point is one <UNK> to even make a choice and is it unfair to one if it seems he is being strung along after you or your heart has made a choice how do you react and how should you react when new information comes up that <UNK> new light on the situation there is one scene near the end that is very subtle but perfectly captures what i think would be a real life reaction instead of over the top movie reaction the subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed basically he doesn't know what to make of things instead of having him act out something or look all <UNK> mouthed <UNK> he just stares off at some fixed point unable to react or say anything at all it's like someone just pulled the plug on him his reaction <UNK> true to me and i appreciated the scene br br like most korean films there is a mix of action <UNK> slapstick and melodrama korean films often take abrupt turns see sex is zero for a great example which can be quite a shock for the <UNK> go ahead and <UNK> yourself with this one like it love it or hate it i think most viewers will be able to relate to and appreciate the characters' actions and reactions
<START> there's potential in there with tell no one a curious and intriguing plot and a french take on a very american story but for me the opportunities were not <UNK> here br br although i liked aspects of this film there were three prominent <UNK> which pulled it right down to four out of ten br br firstly it's a silly clichéd murder mystery a particularly contrived murder she wrote or <UNK> being french doesn't eliminate this problem it's just silly and in french at the same time it's full of implausible <UNK> br br secondly the transition from the us to france seems to have failed <UNK> this french doctor hanging out on the streets of a french city with his new <UNK> and their <UNK> and then there's the car chases br br but <UNK> and mostly it's just too darn long to me a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes and over two hours takes some serious justification this once didn't have it
<START> thorn <UNK> is out of business before they stopped making films they made a <UNK> of a movie using e s p and <UNK> as the basis of the daughter whose father <UNK> a terrible power only in the death of her father did olivia find that her father dubbed from had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of <UNK> br br our picture starts with 6 <UNK> <UNK> pulling in and music to match the discovery of the 6 girls dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet in the walls were all kinds of objects the men were pulling up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a <UNK> hole to form only made the film more bizarre br br if you like extremely chilling scenes this for you unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of <UNK> don't view it without a friendly companion like the <UNK> it has some heart stopping horror in it i gave this a rating of 7 it's in color actress meg <UNK> <UNK> in this film if you can find it see it
<START> 30 years after the original film goodbye mr <UNK> was made over as a musical peter o'toole and clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved <UNK> who is referred to as <UNK> by his beloved wife br br o'toole was excellent here and received another oscar nomination you have to wonder what peter o'toole has to do to win an oscar he has lost the <UNK> award 8 times now you also have to wonder that he lost in 1969 to john wayne for true <UNK> which was really a testament to mr wayne's long career and popularity this year was also marked by great performances by richard burton anne of the thousand days as well as dustin hoffman and jon voight for midnight cowboy br br surprised to see clarke cast as mrs however as this was a musical a beautiful voice came well through and she did a nice piece of acting as well br br who can forget the scene when <UNK> carries on in the class despite the news that his beloved has been killed in a bombing he never got to tell her the wonderful news of his <UNK> promotion br br the beautiful cinematography and music only enhanced a truly memorable experience
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is about an impossible love between a french tourist and the auto <UNK> driver who agrees to take her to a <UNK> with her indifferent boyfriend a sort of third world road movie that <UNK> from lush <UNK> to <UNK> comedy it is distinguished by the stellar performance of <UNK> who has become one of <UNK> actors after his appearance as the event <UNK> in mira <UNK> <UNK> wedding br br in an interview proves to be quite <UNK> by his success <UNK> rather carefully and <UNK> to questions he discovered a love of acting and joined a major theatre <UNK> while in university but for one with so much <UNK> training is surprisingly <UNK> about his craft he speaks of honesty and <UNK> as the of his approach and the <UNK> of his desire to communicate something authentic to the audience is clear on screen conveys an emotional integrity and dramatic <UNK> that lifts his characterization to an extraordinary level and director has cast and directed him perfectly he has a wonderfully <UNK> face which the camera <UNK> in close ups of that face are as compelling as shots of <UNK> who is gorgeous as the <UNK>
<START> a young couple decides to runaway to sunny california they never reach their destination as they decide to pull over at the rest stop br br after a fight with her boyfriend nicole insists on pulling in to a rest stop when she is ready to leave she <UNK> the bathroom to find her boyfriend has disappeared with their car leaving her trapped on the back roads of texas with only an abandoned <UNK> van to keep her company br br rest stop is one of those cheap and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic will rest stop become a cult classic you may ask well the three elements that you need to become a cult classic are gore sex and artistic merit rest stop has bucket loads of gore and while i do not want to give too much away it contains <UNK> of blood <UNK> <UNK> this movie has everything from the bad guy running over a <UNK> legs with his car several times to him making use of a <UNK> on a girl's leg at times it can be about as bloody as a film can get it also has a gratuitous and yet somehow quite intimate love scene in the opening minutes of the film therefore the sex is covered now the hard one  does it have any artistic merit you never get to see the bad guy's face  you see glimpses <UNK> shadowy <UNK> he is a <UNK> relentless monster which alone scores highly on the artistic merit scale the movie has very few characters in it apart from the main protagonist  nicole <UNK> alexander since she spends a large part of the film on her own she cannot reveal her thoughts in the course of a conversation but must speak them <UNK> so that we the audience know what she is thinking at times this can be slightly irritating however it is a brave step by the writer john and it does work for the majority of the film as an audience knows being completely alone and isolated from <UNK> is frightening enough even when you are not being chased by psychotic killers br br so will rest stop become a cult classic it probably will because along the gore sex and <UNK> artistic merit it also has plenty of chills an interesting and inventive plot and gives rise to a lot of shouting at the screen as the main character does plenty of things you should definitely not do when running from a psychotic killer what fun are horror movies if you cannot complain about the stupidity of the victims
<START> what you saw in <UNK> and the french connection is nothing compared to what you have here the chase goes on for nearly 15 minutes and is the best you'll ever see this movie has become a classic crime drama from the <UNK> of 70's film making it's a gritty and realistic portrayal of the mean streets of new york city featuring one of the <UNK> wise guys ever put on screen tony lo behavior in this movie is cool as ice he's ripping off his own associates and making it look like the police are responsible his childhood friend roy <UNK> is a street detective who becomes puzzled by the <UNK> of the <UNK> you can tell that lo enjoying the game throughout the movie at times though the film gets dull but then right when you feel like giving up on it something big happens and it pulls you back in the score by don <UNK> sets the tone of the cold gray in new york city and to top it all off my man joe <UNK> shows up in an early role as the garage man br br score 7 out of 10 stars
<START> it's really not worthy of a <UNK> <UNK> consideration but as entertainment goes it does the job this is one that i've watched with pulse every time at least a dozen times br br most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done and we can recognize them from other work those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it br br this was a fun adventure sort of like the little <UNK> if they just had to be serious
<START> this episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror so far this season masters of horror has produced one really good episode the damned thing it is still early i have faith that the episodes will get better i admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline the episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring but the last fifteen minutes was really good though i am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first <UNK> episodes possessed please save this season john carpenter i have faith that pro life will redeem the entire lackluster season so far br br you're an angry little <UNK>
<START> i swear if i did ever tried cocaine i'd be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog <UNK> out at <UNK> that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads br br there are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob <UNK> character seems to always be <UNK> a shoe or how some characters keep running <UNK> around his path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless br br the movie <UNK> of clumsy and <UNK> this is one i think most could enjoy a few laugh out loud even if you are alone moments ensure that i'll certainly be watching this again
<START> i own this movie i am actually from the same town as the brother directors but that doesn't make the film any better but if one night you wanna watch something not serious and don't have and high expectations i strongly recommend demon summer yes the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny but it contains key elements of a horror comedy i just wanna see some small town kids make a movie full of effects and i say bravo to the <UNK> brothers they are now making more movies and continuing a long dream demon summer was one of the movies that are gonna help them start a great career with a great future speed freak productions and compound pictures described in one word potential
<START> trust the excellent and accurate review this film is compelling and moving in that <UNK> most brutally beautiful film masterpiece way file under unforgettable strong meat or films that <UNK> at the moon <UNK> gets into your nervous system and <UNK> you despite the pain on the screen here's an unrelated list of films that did the same thing for me i e engaged destroyed transformed inspired <UNK> this category <UNK> nerdy film top ten lists that seek film perfection a woman under the influence <UNK> of fear saint jack funny bones out of the blue
<START> this is a very moving movie about life itself the challenges a handicapped person must face in a land that expects perfection is brought to the <UNK> for all to see and hopefully understand it should teach the <UNK> of society that we are all humans and while some of us are gifted with a mind heart and sound body there are decent human beings that exist in the world that are not as lucky or maybe we're the unlucky ones we don't always see the beauty in the world because we're wrapped up in our <UNK> ambitions and see it only in one light what can this world do for me maybe we all wish we were like radio a loving happy individual who loves everyone
<START> i saw this interesting film back to back with the chinese french film <UNK> at the recent <UNK> film festival both were intelligent works made the same year 2004 2005 both had the main characters living in a hotel in both films the hotel is more a metaphor of <UNK> than a location both dealt with love between a man and a woman both had wonderful music and riveting performances what a coincidence and yet how the two films <UNK> in treatment of the subject somewhere at the beginning of the film a man walking on a <UNK> turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a <UNK> post the audience <UNK> into a <UNK> of laughter <UNK> but isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film that entertains you for 2 hours while the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy e g using a <UNK> to listen to <UNK> conversation the film builds on what buster keaton and jacques <UNK> had introduced to cinema earlier stoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of robin williams or the heartwarming danny <UNK> a sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of <UNK> works br br but the film is not mere comedy the anti <UNK> statement cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it the <UNK> that acts as an <UNK> warning to the <UNK> lady the reference to as the <UNK> company he works for etc are several <UNK> that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer laugh yes but reflect on it and enjoy further br br the movie's strength lies in is brief <UNK> script by director paul that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy truth is boring dad is dead but nobody told him bad luck does not exist it is the invention of the losers and the poor then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on <UNK> you will not sleep through this lecture br br provides entertainment <UNK> to the subject the italians know best the mafia it is an existential mafia film br br since truth is boring the director provides a <UNK> as part of the fine meal of superb acting toni good music clever camera work <UNK> a beautiful enigmatic actress <UNK> grand daughter of the great anna and powerful script the <UNK> is for the viewer to figure out whether what <UNK> in the film was the truth it would have been boring if it was wouldn't it
<START> <UNK> first sound film <UNK> the battle of the ice of when the russians under alexander <UNK> defeated the knights eager to bring russia under roman <UNK> made in 1938 <UNK> can be seen as a piece of propaganda the <UNK> knights with their sinister and somewhat goofy <UNK> are obvious stand ins for the nazis the <UNK> by the knights when they enter a russian town seems a <UNK> warning of the <UNK> of world war ii the film ends with a warning those who came to russia with the sword will die by the sword made in delicate black and white somewhat reminiscent of a it also marked <UNK> return to official favor by the late 1920s <UNK> wanted soviet filmmakers to stop <UNK> and made movies that would be more <UNK> and <UNK> to the russian public that stopped <UNK> career in russia for a decade and in <UNK> he came back with his more accessible film strong point is in its second half which features the battle itself and it is <UNK> seen as a <UNK> in movie history never before and probably never after a battle would be so vivid in the screen another strong point is beautiful haunting soundtrack using a composer to score a movie was completely unusual at the time one of its weaker points the comic relief in the form of two <UNK> russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful russian <UNK> is really jarring
<START> mickey mouse is now 75 years old he was created by walt disney a famous producer director etc i love the disney movies because it is great fun watching the cartoon movies altogether walt disney i think is the king of the creations everyone has got to love this creations and the movies by walt disney thank you walt for all the classic characters you made
<START> corny and horrible i was not surprised this short lived show didn't make it i remember <UNK> when tales from the crypt tried <UNK> these corny episodes like they were actually scary coupled with bad acting and lousy music i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived it never showed up again and one can only be thankful for this <UNK>
<START> i loved the first 15 minutes and i loved some of the dialogue in the <UNK> which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead of its time method acting technique but this movie ultimately disappoints even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the <UNK> dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the us government and its more <UNK> citizens it still lacks punch and believability and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already br br and for the record despite rampant rumors to the contrary this movie has never been banned in the us i can't comment on the rumors of uk censorship but i'm suspicious hollywood refused to <UNK> it after its initial film festival showing and i am more than willing to believe the <UNK> government had some influence on this decision however the fact that it never appeared on american television is merely a reflection of this rather careful and advertising driven fashion of doing business as for the present you can have your very own copy of the dvd delivered to your door via amazon in a few days
<START> i would like if they brought back surface i really enjoyed the show along with my family i felt the plot development and storyline were first rate like the other person said it seems that everything gets reduced to the lowest common <UNK> nothing but bland politically correct junk survives just look at the internet to see how many people were watching the show also it is not nice to leave us hanging as to what happened the all of the characters on the show this is the same thing that happened to the time travel show i think was called 8 days but should have been called did the <UNK> kill surface i know the writers strike killed another one of my favorite shows years ago called greatest american hero
<START> the obsession of and is not enough to make a good film <UNK> should have remained in our memory as a brilliant film <UNK> back in the it was not necessary to take the camera the result is quite frustrating it´s a pity for his excellent leading actors
<START> i love this show it's truly unique i was under the impression it was going to have more seasons in anticipation of series 2 recently i purchased series 1 to re watch it in order to be <UNK> when part 2 started now after watching it i was excited and <UNK> more so i came to the site to see the schedule for the <UNK> i am really disappointed to see there no longer are plans for a second series as i was eagerly looking forward to watching more of this story i think they really dropped the ball on this one there was plenty of story line left to build on and lots of unanswered questions i'm now a very unhappy view and i hope that they would <UNK> their decision and pick up the story where it left off
<START> i found this film to be one of those great heart warming gems the story line is tightly woven and the character development throughout fantastic i am a big fan of non us films anyway and this is right up there with <UNK> the closet even king of hearts as is fantastic it is a love story in the true sense of loving life and the twists and turns it takes to get the viewer to understand enjoy view of life which nearly costs him br br more than he is prepared to give are wonderful his co star is unforgettable as his fed up wife i highly recommend this movie for the whole family my children loved it
<START> i just returned from viewing this academy award nominated doc and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture so i realize others won't care br br we can only imagine if there had been a couple more <UNK> in philadelphia back in the late 60's when <UNK> plans were a possibility what a wonderful city center there would be if you wonder whether you'll see more about the <UNK> building at the beginning of the movie be patient for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end br br his son's personal <UNK> in the process of making this film are quite interesting sometimes touching and even funny at times there is one of the most comical anti <UNK> <UNK> ever captured on camera br br <UNK> out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent <UNK> string music and <UNK> is a major point to be found in <UNK> architecture the points made by other <UNK> about the spiritual nature of matter and how <UNK> buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie
<START> well the sci fi channel keeps <UNK> these <UNK> out and they seem to get worse every time when normally good actors like john rhys davies and <UNK> come off as rank amateurs you can imagine how abysmal the rest of the cast in this waste of your time effort is the only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature which is <UNK> in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is the dialogue the plot if this movie and i use the term loosely was food jack in the box would be a <UNK> meal compared to this watch a re run of the <UNK> for the viewing your time would be better spent and a lot scarier as well
<START> i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them but very poor the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again the exact same only they wanted younger kids to be able see it this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one <UNK> is beyond me br br they didn't even bother to change jackie <UNK> character from <UNK> let me explain in <UNK> rodney <UNK> played a <UNK> real estate owner who <UNK> the uptight members of country club in this movie jackie mason plays a <UNK> real estate owner who <UNK> the uptight members of country club a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh no i don't think so a very unfunny dan <UNK> <UNK> copies bill <UNK> character he even goes after the <UNK> now more like a <UNK> in much the same fashion as murray did br br there is not a laugh to be had a <UNK> of the <UNK> in this film jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with <UNK> cannon he is in the bathroom is his <UNK> he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom door handle breaks off wow that's the best they can do eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that's all we get i could have pulled a better script out of my ass br br see it only if you're a die hard fan of the original it's the only way you'll find any kind of laughs in it everyone else steer clear
<START> a <UNK> real drama there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has the characters are not your typical <UNK> terrorist you have a blonde haired blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks he is a converted muslim a well respected business man who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam but has clearly taken the word of the <UNK> to a whole new level the hero of the plot is who is an undercover fbi agent who has <UNK> the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being <UNK> the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow although it is about <UNK> terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are <UNK> which is <UNK> to those concerned with racism considering half the terrorist cell are islam <UNK> it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of the most chilling drama i've ever seen the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends your husband or your <UNK> really are terrorists can be anyone anywhere anytime
<START> i saw one life stand when it premiered at the 2000 <UNK> international film festival and was blown away by it made on a <UNK> budget this black and white digital movie is very much a european film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of <UNK> the film works because it's in the indie tradition dealing with complex issues yet moving and <UNK> by touches of understated humour one life stand avoids falling into the trap of other uk <UNK> films with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes the performances are strong particularly maureen <UNK> as the mother i understand the film has recently been released on dvd and i would definitely recommend it the rating on this site is misleading which is why i gave it a high score because the filmmaker may miles thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2 8 for her amazing achievement
<START> when i was a kid i loved tiny <UNK> i especially loved tiny <UNK> how i spent my summer vacation i thought it was laughs on the floor funny a few years later my friend had the video and i figured i'd watch it for the good old days i was still on the floors laughing my opinion the <UNK> and <UNK> skit is the best they decide to go to happy world land and they end up having a crazy adventure to get there all the skits are funny i'm still looking for the video so if anyone has any <UNK> please write me br br this is one of the funniest cartoons i have ever seen br br 10 10
<START> all the airport movies are <UNK> but this one is the biggest turkey of them all the formula was different for this one because it focused on two disastrous <UNK> and a lot of plot occurring on the ground while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground the stunts with the <UNK> are worth watching for the laughs although the special effects aren't as terrible as i'd expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979 george <UNK> sexist remarks are disgusting and his <UNK> with a prostitute in paris is totally unnecessary and made me gag a little poor martha <UNK> was <UNK> to a role where she did nothing but <UNK> her <UNK> over and over in the bathroom there are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films giving you one more reason not to watch this one
<START> this film doesn't know what it wants to be is it making fun of action movies in general is it satirical is it supposed to be a black comedy this is truly one of the worst films ever made br br <UNK> petty is annoying there i said what everyone else is thinking it's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress route <UNK> bates motel but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b movie actress her <UNK> voice strange mannerisms and poor comic timing <UNK> this film from start to finish until you just want to put your head in a <UNK> and end the pain br br do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs you'll be glad you did
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> is the most pathetic and love story i've ever seen between <UNK> a <UNK> museum <UNK> whose abusive married boyfriend <UNK> her and leaves her even more uptight and confused than she already was and seymour <UNK> a parking attendant so desperate for attention that he spends his nights going to bars and <UNK> <UNK> people there is a chaotic and <UNK> match from the start just like so many <UNK> that we see every day br br in nearly every love story there is a man and a woman the man being confident funny either <UNK> hot or attractive in his own way whose shortcomings are charming and the woman a wounded soul who could have any man she wants who chooses this guy because there's just something about him these movies make everyone feel so good because the characters <UNK> what every man and woman wants to be not what they are <UNK> and <UNK> instead of <UNK> in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance depicts people who may just be more common than the attractive confident people with so much experience playing the field what's the story behind the love affairs of the ugly <UNK> awkward man with no life and no job that we all run into or the woman so crippled by <UNK> that it's difficult to talk to her br br this film is not as fascinating as <UNK> faces or opening night but it has that riveting quality that cassavetes always fought so hard to render which is an <UNK> depiction of people underneath the ego that hides behind itself in nearly all other films gena rowlands and seymour <UNK> delivering <UNK> <UNK> people are hardly likable <UNK> nearly drives us mad let alone <UNK> he <UNK> himself so <UNK> in her life the dates are an explosion of the inner voices of <UNK> that respond to the <UNK> inept <UNK> on dates we've all been on <UNK> we've all <UNK> and arguments we've all had that we know were our own faults i admire a film like <UNK> and <UNK> because as the trademark is with the films cassavetes <UNK> himself it <UNK> with us in 100 honesty our <UNK> play no part in company with his characters thus a tremendous achievement per performance by actor
<START> i found this movie to be a complete waste of <UNK> minutes jones was a weird kid and is messed up according to my memory which might be wrong <UNK> he only 16 or 17 years old spoiler why did he leave college and rent an apartment with a two crazy girls who <UNK> over boys for a and the cowboy who lives underneath jones <UNK> me out too how he knew what happened in the apartments didnt <UNK> past me for a minute i do not understand his thinking about the girl that took pictures for fun and stayed in her room when mandy moore was always over and is was quite obvious that she wanted to be more than friends with him i dont really find this movie funny or artsy or dramatic or anything i found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time d f
<START> this movie is awesome due to the fact that it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s the animators were not lazy like they are today the cartoon had so much detail with very little resources they have with them compared with what we have today if more people would request these cartoons to be <UNK> then maybe all of the other 80s cartoons would be shown on television once again therefore to finish my sentence i would just like to say that this was a cartoon that i grew up with and really would like it to be on tv once again
<START> <UNK> 3 is absolutely right although i am sure that mr <UNK> wanted to make a sincere heartwarming christmas movie this one is as cynical and creepy as they come the religious significance of christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids clueless <UNK> and dopey villains the production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a <UNK> or by truly inexperienced filmmakers i suspect the latter unfortunately the worst part oddly enough really is the music you would think someone with a long standing musical career could do better than the title song but you would be wrong even my mom didn't like this movie and she likes the and sappy stuff
<START> if you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is dont br br for me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most british irish films are forgettable tripe is the best i can say if it had been on telly l would have <UNK> off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start i saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes but oh dear br br as a comedy it wasn't funny as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy as a love story totally unbelievable most of all as a piece of over the top it lacked both style and charm and caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er and caine is it just me but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the <UNK> does michael caine leave you cold br br in fairness some of my friends thought it was <UNK> but if you do go my advice is have a few drinks or <UNK> beforehand and leave your critical <UNK> safely locked up at home br br
<START> there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so let's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and <UNK> film cat was well just awful br br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and <UNK> commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks br br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers <UNK> isn't going to spy this film so what was the studio thinking br br the cat was also apparently related to linda <UNK> can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish <UNK> i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you don't say <UNK> you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume make up or dialogue br br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden <UNK> and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the <UNK> shot was missing and even that wouldn't have helped br br the same folks who created <UNK> clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in <UNK> the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myers br br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston <UNK> fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genre br br call the <UNK> this cat should be <UNK> and never be allowed to <UNK> again please please no sequel
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is trapped in her own home by crazy robert ryan in beware my lovely a <UNK> film from rko <UNK> and ryan did three films together and worked well as a team both being <UNK> professionals and strong performers in this film based on a broadway play called the man <UNK> is a world war i widow who <UNK> out a room in her home she's very active and well liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years she's not ready to move on the man who <UNK> her room goes on vacation and <UNK> hires robert ryan to help her with some heavy duty cleaning in the house he's friendly enough to start but later <UNK> her <UNK> her in the house and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality br br the character played by ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in it isn't clear whether or not he's the killer since he seems surprised to see the body he might be a split personality as when his personality turns ugly toward <UNK> he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it he doesn't know that he has the keys to <UNK> house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door br br beware my lovely is a very suspenseful film and the two leads give terrific performances the tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting
<START> large <UNK> vs <UNK> do good <UNK> we seem to witness events both real life and reel life of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by <UNK> every means dirty necessary and the truth gets <UNK> at least in this movie jack jack lemmon got his points across and paid for it <UNK> we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years the most memorable of which was 'the where russell <UNK> played a <UNK> industry scientist who tried to blow the <UNK> claiming that the industry added more <UNK> in <UNK> to make <UNK> addicted there was also this reporter protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he she has to choose between <UNK> and his <UNK> and sometimes his her life br br jane fonda played reporter <UNK> wells to perfection she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an <UNK> <UNK> she and her crew the cameraman played by post michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit cameraman michael douglas <UNK> <UNK> gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no photography zone and <UNK> it out of the station the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station br br in the mean time the chief engineer jack <UNK> an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of <UNK> in the equipment that's being used for the <UNK> this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed br br this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments now that's great and unusual in movies performances were all good and i love jack lemmon we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles i give this movie an 8 10
<START> rarely seen a movie that <UNK> so much from the original premise and still remains more or less is a rather short which is a good thing in this case <UNK> that focuses on the mysterious <UNK> box who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire <UNK> of the man who eventually created it we're introduced to 3 generations of the <UNK> family all played by bruce <UNK> one in 18th century paris one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far far opinions on this storyline may <UNK> a you think it's very idiotic and far fetched and <UNK> the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely <UNK> yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling <UNK> <UNK> contains quite a lot of exquisite <UNK> and the charismatic presence of <UNK> doug <UNK> still is an extra horror value <UNK>  accompanied by a pet puppy this time  still knows how to bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly best aspects in this production are the newly introduced and the occult <UNK> portrait giant turn offs are the weak script the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to <UNK> initial masterpiece br br although not highly memorable itself <UNK> stands as the last watchable <UNK> film after this sequel the series went downhill completely so far 2 more sequels came out 2 more are still in process and neither of those is worth seeing <UNK> <UNK> suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan he doesn't want to be remembered as the director of it who could blame him
<START> this is a romantic albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites it is one of the many classics of the 80's genre like pretty in pink or some kind of wonderful br br <UNK> plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley <UNK> girl julie it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end br br true most of the acting sucks but br br i have been in love with <UNK> since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since he's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential br br if you love 80's movies you will love this classic br br go rent it

<START> stunning blonde natasha <UNK> is the young not so <UNK> widow in the mansion on the hill telling her story to a tv reporter in virginia and among the <UNK> well <UNK> <UNK> set she's suspected of involvement in the death of her older husband that's james <UNK> <UNK> as a babe in arms flashback made in canada based on an article that appeared in vanity fair magazine it must be true whatever it's far more romance than mystery and a very familiar tale <UNK> species star <UNK> as a gold digging <UNK> nurse it could happen i guess and it's good to see <UNK> in a <UNK> role after his turn in antwone fisher even if he doesn't make it to the end of the picture the end of the picture he doesn't even make it to the beginning of the picture which is why flashbacks were invented of course
<START> rise of the undead starts as some huge nuclear type blast rips through an <UNK> american city a few people survive in a building by <UNK> on the door so it'll stay closed keep the <UNK> out they argue amongst themselves for ages then a monster thing arrives from seemingly nowhere begins to kill them of one by one br br written produced directed by jason <UNK> shannon one has to say rise of the undead is terrible the script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense the first thing i asked myself was if there's this huge nuclear blast type thing going on outside destroying the entire city why are these people i'm watching still alive why is the building they are in still standing then i asked myself when was something actually going to happen the entire first 20 minutes is set in one room actually that's a bit generous it's more of a <UNK> as the main character's argue then it turns into some return of the living dead 1985 rip off with a government created virus which turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt pointless seemingly random plot twists i've ever witnessed which <UNK> most of what has just happened a complete waste of time then for the final 30 odd minutes rise of the undead turns into some strange sci fi type thing as something which resembles a ball of energy <UNK> around killing everyone was i the only asking what this floating ball of energy thing is where it came from getting back to what was happening outside what was the reason again oh that's right we are never told rise of the undead is a mess the character's are awful aren't even given names the twist about halfway through will have you <UNK> your hair out in frustration the dialogue sucks nothing is explained there's virtually no story here the final 10 minutes maybe a bit more of rise of the undead features no dialogue whatsoever the film just suddenly ends br br director's <UNK> were obviously working on a low budget the entire film is set in about two rooms three corridors the photography is awful they use annoying colour <UNK> seemingly at random sometimes it really does look like rise of the undead was shot on a camcorder there's no special effects there's some fake blood <UNK> around but no actual make up effects to speak of there are some cgi shots of the city being <UNK> in flames which look alright but the floating ball of energy creature thing looks terrible there is one <UNK> shot early on where two people are sitting against a <UNK> wall talking for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen just their lower bodies from the neck down are seen yet nothing else is happening in frame they are not moving there's no else there but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other it's quite an odd thing to watch actually br br with an ultra low budget of about 10 000 according to the imdb shot in two weeks i have to <UNK> the makers for getting rise of the undead finished distributed but that's where my <UNK> stop because otherwise this has awful production values is set in about three corridors which are located somewhere in new orleans in <UNK> as that's where rise of the undead was shot the acting sucks so i won't <UNK> on it br br rise of the undead sucks it sounds like a zombie film but in all honestly it isn't everything about it is sub par i know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but that's not really an excuse as far as i'm concerned definitely not recommended
<START> this is one the worst movie i've seen and certainly worst movie has made i can't believe person who has created movie like teen can create utter crap like this br br plot of the film itself is really <UNK> that <UNK> has to search <UNK> and get her to help her husband avoid death penalty in <UNK> common logic says if <UNK> cannot search <UNK> easily so won't the government so <UNK> can safely <UNK> signature or thumb print and produce it before the another <UNK> thing is <UNK> has given incorrect address in his <UNK> so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime <UNK> gets <UNK> through government wow doesn't it make well <UNK> in india more than indians br br makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of <UNK> who is <UNK> <UNK> and seeks father in law <UNK> this guy is just wasted 's help to get her as a keep br br cannot speak hindi and he has been <UNK> by other guys to <UNK> the english dialogs he writes in hindi this time it seems that his <UNK> was in serious <UNK> when writing dialogs like <UNK> leap of honesty within minutes to our worst nightmares <UNK> not only takes this honest leap she <UNK> her feet to do <UNK> dance of honesty br br one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice <UNK> but since bollywood has learned the thing called post production almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely <UNK> backdrops so no big deal br br conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> and all are ready to get affected
<START> cute idea to have <UNK> <UNK> do the song <UNK> for this movie adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> book a la valley of the dolls although it's really too bad this <UNK> doesn't have patty <UNK> o'hara to spike the story the love machine is <UNK> dull even the final <UNK> with an academy award as a fight prop can't save it <UNK> cannon seems <UNK> in her heavy <UNK> make up and <UNK> fall although her tiny figure is a beauty to behold john phillip law is a block of wood in the lead david <UNK> embarrassing in gay mode as a flamboyant photographer and where is robin stone walking to at the end is he <UNK> out to the <UNK> to pick up some sailors after cannon has <UNK> his <UNK> it would be a safe bet in that case love machine the final episode <UNK> been a more interesting flick certainly better than this yawn inducing <UNK> opera 1 2 from
<START> typically <UNK> crafted hbo production with a first rate cast a rich small town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes <UNK> by above average production values br br but and that's a huge the various subplots <UNK> with some likable mostly annoying caricatures are paper thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours br br the often silly story <UNK> <UNK> between melodrama without being entertaining enough and personal drama without being profound at all br br a shame because some scenes really shine two or three that is br br 4 out of 10 <UNK> paul
<START> think of this film as fan service a wet dream for the slasher genre admirer we start off with a gory prologue which is pretty much unrelated to the rest of the film flash forward nine months and the real meat of the plot begins the <UNK> mandy lane is <UNK> by every jock and nerd in her school and gets invited to spend a weekend at a ranch by three guys who think they can get lucky and two <UNK> obsessed with their weight and <UNK> size so you have a bunch of young students in a house in the middle of nowhere on a dark night who want to do nothing but have sex do drugs and drink booze the only other company is a hunky ranch hand who may or may not be suffering from <UNK> war syndrome hmm potential future suspect maybe br br so as you're probably by now all the house guests end up being slaughtered in a variety of bloody ways and for a change the black man isn't the first to die there are some conventions that still hold up though like the scantily clad babe being chased by a car in a field or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our <UNK> <UNK> separate to tackle the problem even down to the so called shocking twist at the end the movie is like an old 80's horror updated for the <UNK> and on this score it succeeds br br unfortunately it also <UNK> a lot of the problems of the films of that era too namely the paper thin characters and the predictability of the whole enterprise people get cut up shot <UNK> etc but because of their <UNK> <UNK> to the audience and stupidity in getting themselves in these situations it's hard to care as the bodies stack up someone gets murdered one of their friends goes out to look for them alone bang they're brown bread <UNK> then repeat maybe one day we'll get a screenplay with plausible intelligent likable characters who make rational decisions but still end up being <UNK> by a genius killer until then we have to tolerate teenagers with the i q of pond life being picked off by a deranged <UNK> oh well 4 10
<START> i have to say that some of the other reviews of this film i have read show very little understanding of it or the original tv series it <UNK> from <UNK> army was a sitcom and therefore had humour and so is bound to have put a smile on the face of the dire situation however the series carried very many serious messages such as the episode about the <UNK> and ignorance that was attached to <UNK> <UNK> the film was faithful to the series and was simply like an extended episode so i'm afraid the reviewer who claimed that columbia improved the humour was quite wrong and let's face it the bbc sitcoms of this period beat anything that came out of america hands down also comments referring to propaganda were also way off the mark the were people considered <UNK> for <UNK> service who still wished to serve they were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed up as hitler announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when britain was <UNK> thank you for allowing me the opportunity to set the record straight as it is always good to actually speak and comment on what has been seen rather making it up as you go along i find
<START> i sell the dead revolves around convicted grave <UNK> arthur blake <UNK> friend and fellow grave <UNK> willie has just been executed and blake is going to follow suit the next morning while he sits in his cell awaiting his execution a priest named father <UNK> comes in and asks him if he will tell all he has seen as a grave <UNK> he then proceeds to give father <UNK> a quasi biography of his more interesting exploits br br the plot pretty much consists of several incidents only tied together by <UNK> this <UNK> the viewer from ever getting bored but it also makes the events less significant as you could easily add or remove a lot of scenes without <UNK> it much though flawed i thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the film and kept it very entertaining most of the various stories are good specifically the alien the murphy's and the vampire but others weren't so great br br the acting isn't amazing but i didn't find it bad at any point dominic <UNK> had a good performance as he managed to be serious when it <UNK> and also play very well into the comedic parts of the film br br the characters were not extremely in depth but they were all interesting i also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in a over the top almost comic book manner the part with the back story of the murphy's and their gang is priceless br br so overall i sell the dead very successfully combines horror comedy and sci fi into a <UNK> mash of fun and excitement it is one of the more interesting and original movies i have seen in a while and it's unfortunate that independent films like this don't get more recognition
<START> one of the <UNK> is wrong this is not the only pat <UNK> film and he didn't die two years after this was made he shot a film called the electric chair in <UNK> he shot this a few years after doctor gore <UNK> died in the late 70's i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there it sucked also this was a big deal when the movie came out no independent horror films were being made in <UNK> this movie didn't help matters <UNK> used to do gore effects for h g lewis he was also good at magic his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done the film was shot in a building that also <UNK> a 7 11 you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes the budget was less that 20 000 and the script looked like a child wrote it only <UNK> could understand it still it's entertainment and it's a classic
<START> i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or we also know that bats are <UNK> that can fly thus many them to be exceptional as i watched the film i realized that the theme of bat is deeply <UNK> in this movie more than just to make the bat vampire connection br br <UNK> of human nature if you ever read <UNK> there is this one fable where <UNK> and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage <UNK> and birds find out what this bat has been doing and <UNK> the bat out of their lands at the end of the story br br the two <UNK> sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang blind priest friend sang effort to <UNK> <UNK> and his sexual desire <UNK> <UNK> playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc won't ruin too much u have to watch the film and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark comedy tragedy vengeance you name it br br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i haven't seen <UNK> yet i wouldn't say this is <UNK> <UNK> best work but it is <UNK> <UNK> the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing
<START> i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it i don't know why but i ended up watching it the whole 2 hours we have seen this type of movie i don't know how many times br br back in 1998 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one here are my problems with this film 1 cheap special effects like something out of the old computer 2 no background information or explanation on weather <UNK> if you are going to make a movie about weather at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details 3 how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is <UNK> on chicago no more experts left in the field 4 where are some interesting characters i truly don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman i felt that there was no character development 5 no thought provoking moment what so ever and <UNK> incorrect theme and this is only the first part of the film i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie i can only imagine what we are to expect of course at the end the main characters will survive and life will go on how original
<START> i do not fail to recognize <UNK> above average film making skills for example i appreciate his lingering on <UNK> natural day <UNK> settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism however regarding the content of this film i am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> relations or feelings and or <UNK> practices the problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably <UNK> as is the alienation and <UNK> felt by walter i don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable i mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on i mean d s is not something new in the world and i think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something <UNK> or <UNK> it isn't in general films dealing with this subject are really <UNK> behind the times br br so for me i feel that this film ends up being quite a <UNK> film worried with very outdated <UNK> theories isn't it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real life lives and experiences of those engaged in d s relationships personal experience <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even recent <UNK> studies will show this
<START> film certainly can be a narrative medium but by no means is it the ideal medium literature best carries a plot because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is a series of images <UNK> together what soderbergh does in <UNK> twelve is combine impeccable film making technique with the free flowing form of american movies from the 1970s from looking at the comments posted recently most people went in expecting a standard issue heist movie a la <UNK> it seems people actually miss the tiresome clichés of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake <UNK> directing <UNK> is reason alone to see this movie but close ups of pitt and zeta jones forty feet high on the screen don't hurt either a true treat for those who love the <UNK> of lights on the silver screen and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it's not
<START> as a cartoon the movie was pretty bad it is only <UNK> minutes long yet several battles occur culminating with the destruction of the <UNK> <UNK> one <UNK> was the very beginning of the movie an animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle <UNK> that right there was a major turn off and made the rest of the movie lack credibility then there was the issue of <UNK> tied up along with his parrot and tossed into some room where nobody had checked for several days whatever happened to <UNK> cameras br br the <UNK> base only had a handful of characters and the rest were bat robots aside from a lot of corridors the <UNK> base did not seem to have any weapons tanks <UNK> or any other equipment then there was the silly notion that 100 complex <UNK> could be created overnight the plot was silly even if this was intended for small children <UNK> <UNK> girls and even barney the dinosaur give more attention to their plots br br the characters were not bad except that i could never understand anything was saying and the <UNK> commander was silly and not much of a villain in fact except for storm shadow and the rest of the <UNK> characters were comical and hardly impressive the <UNK> joe characters were pretty good scarlett agent faces road block and snake eyes were my favorites here <UNK> and beach head were the worst <UNK> is written as a goof ball and beach head sounded like some 1990s <UNK> dude i guess the writer larry <UNK> was trying to make a character that <UNK> to teenagers but he was a decade off the mark just listening to beach <UNK> <UNK> talk fast times at <UNK> high i was wondering if the new <UNK> <UNK> were going to smoke a before the big mission br br the cgi was pretty good except that <UNK> commander had a <UNK> <UNK> walk and the vehicles did not look very realistic at all the flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive old style animation would have been much better than this since reportedly likes to do things cheap they got what they paid for i had trouble watching the whole thing it was just boring and lacked any soul or <UNK> joe spirit even the old <UNK> joe commercials would have been better in fact the dvd included extras such as four or five current commercials for <UNK> joe spy troops and those commercials were much more entertaining than the movie the commercials had more kid oriented fun and spirit the commercials were lively while the movie was dull
<START> in my opinion the movie is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all nations who fought and <UNK> into the <UNK> <UNK> the lack of violence in no way <UNK> from the <UNK> of the tale in hand it is honest true and brave just like the men that fought and died at the the lack of brutal depictions of violence are just and proper those men suffered enough for freedom liberty and the right to self determination in a free and better world they never wished to ever see such <UNK> again that is the legacy of the event of <UNK> to suffer <UNK> of gratuitous <UNK> and blood and gore is best not shown for the <UNK> of proper respect for the <UNK> of this <UNK> of br br this film <UNK> in the <UNK> of men fighting for their lives with honour courage dignity and <UNK> spirit and humour in the face of appalling <UNK> this film is not interested in making a spectacle for fools to cheer over the brutal <UNK> that from these personal <UNK> of these men is not a thing that those that survived ever wished to see on a screen for entertainment they saw enough of that at the time and would much rather have never seen it at first and never wished to review such scenes again on a screen in the name of entertainment the brutal horrors of the <UNK> of the vicious combat fought at <UNK> were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days it was the painful internal <UNK> they the men of all those nations who fought carried inside to their graves they all fought and many died in the face of it all and somehow they those mighty hearted men managed to laugh in the teeth of constant dread death because they <UNK> insult their mates by not being prepared to die game beside them that's for brave game is but it applied to all <UNK> to a greater or lesser degree but word from the boy's that fought was that <UNK> was as game that is as brave as you would ever wish for a soldier to be br br and <UNK> were fighting to establish their place on the world stage and from 25 <UNK> 15 <UNK> their respective claims for <UNK> in were made known and <UNK> to that world the director has made a masterpiece that truly <UNK> the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages for children can be taken without fear of frightening them for the sake of visual horror and it's morbid and pointless appeal and children should attend this movie so as to learn what happened at that sacred shore before they were born so that they can remember for it is the nature of men that they soon forget
<START> just to let everyone know this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen pretty much everything if you're thinking of renting it don't it's not worth the cardboard <UNK> that it came in
<START> personally i regard the egyptian in an extremely <UNK> light br br it was introduced to me by a well known australian movie <UNK> critic named bill who was renowned for his insight broad vision of people places particularly of films this movie <UNK> the bill perfectly i came to appreciate his commentary enthusiasm for this movie that emerged all the more as i watched it as i was literally drawn into it minute by minute beyond his <UNK> comments on my initial viewing many years ago br br to me it was <UNK> <UNK> upon <UNK> within half an hour into an intriguing fascinating production yes i am aware of its flaws but it was so <UNK>  the young man of <UNK> learning from inspired by his father  the <UNK> treated like rubbish in his suffering  the <UNK> friend however flawed but nonetheless loved by his friend the central character  and to be sure a flawed hero too like so many across humanity of all societies across all lovable worthy of love too yes i believe in a christian god but too i acknowledge the rights respect that should be due any human being of good heart who would not or will not <UNK> the rights of his without just cause as such i <UNK> this film its presentation of a man of good heart conviction in his belief in the sun god he was devoted to such people will always be welcome in my world vision and hopefully in many more beyond br br so too the drama in the ensuing movie i have watched often as surely as it has touched my heart soul as surely as it seems to have <UNK> critics in its era it is captivating watching the struggles grief loves of the <UNK> when i watch it again i am always reminded of my friend in heart bill the film critic who <UNK> to <UNK> all the critics long ago who it he added criticism of too many critics  that they make <UNK> to honour stars on the screen or in history but they do not make <UNK> to honour critics and beyond all this i am reminded with each viewing of a superb touching spectacle of a beautiful well presented drama that was not just relevant to the 1950s or some <UNK> era it was meant for you me across time place to every man woman child to their personal aspirations for love freedom <UNK> obstacles to <UNK> gross injustice tragedy appealing to those of simple faith of many <UNK> that it seems too many regard as cause for war take a night off from <UNK> or <UNK> violence from <UNK> <UNK> attacks on others executed consider the merits of this offering not to the sun god or to power that proves time again to be so let this outstanding movie wash over you like waves onto a beach like the passing hands of time  like life was meant to be and maybe you will find yourself carried into its world of possibilities lost offerings no more 9 9 out of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> directed the 1959 film the journey starring <UNK> <UNK> deborah kerr robert <UNK> e g marshall anne jackson and jason <UNK> br br the film takes place during the 1956 hungarian <UNK> and concerns a group of <UNK> having problems getting out of <UNK> because of political problems in that part of the world they are put on a bus to vienna but the russians led by major <UNK> their <UNK> and hold them for questioning one of the passengers is paul <UNK> <UNK> posing as an american but in reality a hungarian freedom fighter whom the major believes is being <UNK> out of <UNK> in fact lady kerr is hiding him she becomes the focus of the romantic <UNK> br br very good film that conveys the tension and <UNK> of the cold war and all of the performances are wonderful <UNK> is particularly excellent as the passionate major who isn't all bad and anne jackson gives a realistic powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesn't want her child born in a communist country br br good script good director good cast there should be more films like this highly recommended
<START> it would be wrong and <UNK> of me to advise you to watch <UNK> 2 you must have better things to do <UNK> the car throwing stones in a stream but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is it's almost a proper film which a lot more than most straight to dvd <UNK> can manage <UNK> 2 is helped a great deal by <UNK> manic turn as the eponymous clown he throws himself into the role with such <UNK> <UNK> that he almost <UNK> the <UNK> in the movie's favour but of course it takes more than one man in big shoes <UNK> <UNK> gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed <UNK> ending all over the place and almost good fun
<START> i tried god knows i tried to like this swiss cheese of a movie but the story was too full of holes some big enough to drive a horse drawn <UNK> through the acting overall was even and the characters endearing enough that you <UNK> they died off like recently <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> off to die their own gruesome deaths overall however it was not really very scary <UNK> we have seen spooky quickly moving figures in the background since the <UNK> why back when and it was scary then just briefly this film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writer's job naturally you would expect the director to pick up on the fact that the story did not make sense like who's was the secret room behind the wardrobe why did the blood hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as <UNK> by the book they read earlier why did the computer say game over for <UNK> character even though he lived the list goes on and on i don't really feel comfortable <UNK> this film as its makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough payoff in truly scary moments
<START> the one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins what is a jewish porno film br br while this film had its interesting moments it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with <UNK> jewish <UNK> exactly what was going on and why how many people who came across this film would know that the <UNK> the female characters were <UNK> in is in reality called a which is a ritual bath used to <UNK> spiritual the same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the <UNK> a <UNK> number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage <UNK> being performed these two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the <UNK> audience br br this film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions the characters are presented very <UNK> right down to the number of <UNK> an ultra <UNK> jewish male must wear as well as the religious <UNK> he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day the attitudes <UNK> <UNK> has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times <UNK> this is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context br br i recommend this film to people who are familiar with <UNK> jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief <UNK> at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like br br the story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against the system is of <UNK> interest at best
<START> found this movie in a rental store never heard about it before but it was a good movie great acting and thrilling story line great kudos to vincent <UNK> he made thomas character very attractive and brought a special atmosphere to this movie br br <UNK> br br
<START> this is one of <UNK> greatest <UNK> to music alongside her trapped in the body of a white girl album to quote the great <UNK> dare to go bare just wear your underwear you'll get a ride home <UNK> wow now that is some good advice you can dance at my party yeah justify your dance shoes you're invited to the party in my pants yeah come on boy let's dance at the party in my pants julie brown is hilarious it is almost sad that this video is only <UNK> minutes long but every minute is awesome
<START> my brother in law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible it was from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible it does not even quite register as a b movie maybe an n or a p one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen from the rubber <UNK> on a stick to the still breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free br br skip this one altogether unless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends it will provide good <UNK>
<START> the first <UNK> film was enjoyable by adults as well as children this one starts with about an hour of filler where not much happens with stilted dialogue only in the last act is there any significant action that really moves the plot along the dog is still cute though and young kids may enjoy it
<START> heart of darkness movie review could a book that is well known for its <UNK> <UNK> and complicated concepts ever be made into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning in the book so far that goal hasn't been achieved the heart of darkness was attempted to be made into a movie in 1993 but it was a failure in comparison to the book br br it is hard enough to make any book into a movie there always is the worry that it won't be as <UNK> or have the same meaning so why the novel the heart of darkness is made into a movie i am clueless there is so much description and hidden meaning throughout the entire book when just reading the words <UNK> i think that a person would think it is pretty boring and wouldn't get the symbolism i think that is what happened in the movie the movie just <UNK> the story at the surface br br the movie didn't even follow the full storyline of the book major changes were made that i thought made the movie worse for example the manager did not go along on the boat with <UNK> and the rest of the crew the spy did instead i think that took out some major plots and took out the great deception of the manager in relation to <UNK> also <UNK> wasn't even on the <UNK> when he died which especially made the entire journey even more <UNK> which just got annoying after a while and when <UNK> was telling fiancée about his final moments and words it was no where near as <UNK> or important the fiancée didn't even get that upset br br as far as the acting went none of the actors did a very good job except for the actor that played in my opinion <UNK> was not very evil and that was kind of an important thing in the book also other characters such as <UNK> the manager and the fiancé didn't do the characters justice that they deserved from the book their acting wasn't very exciting or memorable at all over all i don't think that this book should have even been attempted to be made into a movie i think it is fine to use some of the themes in a different story line like in apocalypse now but as for following the same exact story line of the book it just does it shame
<START> was struck at how even the acting was throughout william haines had an acting range that is wonderful for silent film not over the edge there are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when he is waiting to see the <UNK> very well done br br thoroughly enjoyed the flick br br
<START> apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer <UNK> this film is not worth seeing br br the storyline is so <UNK> and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again like a lost <UNK> polar puppy dog br br the musical score is awful relying too heavily on extremely <UNK> pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way as if the <UNK> were acting as an emotions <UNK> sheet  <UNK> sad <UNK> <UNK> shocked <UNK> <UNK> scared <UNK> on top of that the repetitive <UNK> used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter br br gone are the days of silent film where musical <UNK> were the sole portrayal of voice  but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen br br the voice over was so over <UNK> that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story br br and the stolen ideas from jane <UNK> the piano are too obvious to overlook not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to <UNK> camera work on the latter  but the voice over feeling and levels too are strikingly close and who could forget when holly <UNK> character has her wings <UNK> in the form of her <UNK> finger being cut off by sam <UNK> does it remind you of when has his <UNK> and surprisingly too with an axe i thought so br br all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing unless you wear some ear and just go with the scenery in mind
<START> this is another of eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue action and a <UNK> of romance along with the <UNK> and so forth <UNK> acting range by now is pretty familiar in this one he's <UNK> and a bit outrageous especially with women and superiors there are no surprises in his performance but the film itself is something of a surprise it's above average br br clint is frank a secret service agent who perhaps in a moment of doubt failed to catch the bullet that killed <UNK> he then took to drink which drove his family away and now <UNK> along in the <UNK> until he is <UNK> by john calling himself booth who strikes up a sort of <UNK> relationship with him based on their shared <UNK> conviction that everything is meaningless except the <UNK> to escape <UNK> and predictability now this is rather an set of attitudes for a performer like clint to project but he does rather well less robotic than usual and he does seem to carry around with him like a burden of stone the memory of that moment in dallas he's tested again halfway through this movie he is hanging from the roof of a tall building <UNK> <UNK> hand and he pulls his pistol and points it at booth who asks him if he is really willing to shoot if he does of course he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a cia trained murderer but he does so at the cost of his own life booth <UNK> him about the situation as they hold hands in <UNK> and clint even has a short speech talking to <UNK> russo about his failure to save the president in dallas if i'd have <UNK> quickly enough i could have taken that shot and that would have been alright with me it's <UNK> but his voice <UNK> slightly his eyes water and his lip it's one of the few scenes in any of <UNK> films that might properly be called moving we know from his <UNK> resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time the irony is that he doesn't like the current president who could he gives pompous speeches in <UNK> about how they <UNK> a nation out of the wilderness didn't they do the same thing in las vegas br br it's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain it isn't true nothing is that simple but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case the <UNK> john with his eyes is marvelous br br talk about <UNK> okay he can ham it up a little <UNK> with disdain even as he <UNK> two innocent hunters between the eyes but he's fascinating on the screen <UNK> russo has little do to fred thompson as the chief white house aid is now back in politics a relief for movie goers if <UNK> acting range is limited <UNK> is something less in every film he's been in he wears the same <UNK> and <UNK> expression as if constantly plagued by some form of <UNK> <UNK> disorder br br the direction by <UNK> peterson is as good as it was in <UNK> boot which is pretty good there is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross cutting in the final shootout and when clint and russo fall into an <UNK> embrace in her hotel room and <UNK> backwards towards the bed like two <UNK> in heat peterson <UNK> shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor not only the usual <UNK> but <UNK> guns palm pilots dick tracy <UNK> watches and other <UNK> interrupted clint lies back on the bed and <UNK> now i have to put all that stuff back on again br br well written and worth watching
<START> i've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects plot is choppy and very predictable most of the actors seem like extras with no experience everyone has scottish accents it's like watching a crew of from star trek without the personality or charm needless scenes of people putting up <UNK> <UNK> with all of the supposedly high tech equipment actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them nothing to make you care if these people survive or not looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining do not waste your time
<START> i believe anyone who enjoyed <UNK> the terrible movies would enjoy this well crafted movie this movie played out like lord of the ring return of the king but without the special effect but as good and better drama br br we have the german who dressed like <UNK> <UNK> of russia the russian <UNK> <UNK> to lead them to fight the german to save russia <UNK> who played <UNK> in the <UNK> the terrible films was charismatic as <UNK> the first 10 min how he handled the passing by <UNK> was captivating br br many of the scenes were beautiful even in black and white the anticipation of war did not require any dialogue such as how many enemy we will be killing etc except for a few speeches the film can basically be played out as a silent film the fighting scene can hold up to those of the civil war fighting scene of the birth of a nation br br another strength of the movie is the great musical score by <UNK> the music gave an epic feel to the movie in those scenes without dialogue
<START> who could have thought a non disabled actor could act so realistically and immensely <UNK> as a disabled person in a film probably someone but no one truly no one could ever compare their expectations with the amazingly <UNK> and powerful performance given by the two actors in this film br br michael steven robertson lives in a home for disabled people he has cerebral and as shown to us right at the beginning he has huge trouble <UNK> so it truly is a <UNK> when fellow disabled member <UNK> james <UNK> who can speak normally understands him thus starts off a friendship that relies mainly on ironically enough communication br br in a hilarious scene they manage to move out of the home into their own after <UNK> had been rejected good hearted michael put forward an <UNK> to move into his own house <UNK> who already had a bad name with the judges was to be his <UNK> br br but troubles soon come about they begin good <UNK> stalking a girl who they met in a pub a while back wanting her to be their assistant to do the little things that matter she at first is reluctant she does not know these men but seems they could be harmless so strikes up another friendship but not necessarily a good one br br as well as being poignant however this film really does rely on the actors but that isn't a bad thing for a non disabled actor you see <UNK> though he can communicate properly frustrated at the way he's completely <UNK> on other people and has no real life of his own but the real star for me is steven robertson he acts with such emotion yearning to fit in and sadness happiness that really sees him win over the whole entire film br br excellent br br overall 5 out of 5
<START> i only watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally i think that this is the worst movie to be made in the recent years br br the plot was so bad that it might have been possible that a 10 year old kid wrote it the acting was also sloppy with pretty much an unknown cast and not only that the action sequences especially at the first half of the film were so terrible it was unbelievable br br i don't know how the producers <UNK> the budget to film this movie but the production company must be <UNK> it by now br br to anyone who may come across this film in the near future i advise you to steer clear of this joke of a movie
<START> shadow <UNK> <UNK> the joy and <UNK> of the first movie audiences it also shows the power of film in its ability to bring the world a little closer overcome cultural <UNK> and to <UNK> ourselves for generations yet to come certainly anyone who truly loves the art of the motion picture will enjoy this film it's a great first effort by writer director ann <UNK> who will hopefully have many films to follow
<START> yeah i guess this movie is kinda dull compared to some of pam <UNK> other films the plot is overly familiar the dialog stilted and some of the acting isn't too good but it's worth seeing for the lengthy stretch near the end of the film where we see ms <UNK> in a sexy blue with the <UNK> half yeah it seems like a <UNK> point when discussing an actress of pam <UNK> talent but she also happens to be an extremely gorgeous woman and back in the day she had a body that wouldn't quit it's nice to see it being <UNK> in a tight rent the dvd and then tell me i'm wrong can't can you that's because you know i'm right and yes i really did give a 10 just for the scenes
<START> early coppola with sublime cast that most folks never got to see a pity there's some wonderful things going on in this one shirley <UNK> best performance an underrated actress a road trip in the late 1960's james <UNK> very restrained and moving robert duvall in a part he was born to play edgy lonely motorcycle cop and a touching script with f coppola behind the wheel br br if this had been made five years later by some nobody it would have been a smash so much for timing anyway i recommend this to all people who don't need outer space explosions and bad mother in law jokes or a billion dollar budget to sit for a few hours and watch a story unfold give this one a chance if you can find it
<START> if daphne du <UNK> had set rebecca in 1950s san francisco it might very well resemble this uptight highly unusual noir from robert wise <UNK> <UNK> plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and <UNK> herself into the life of richard who happens also to be the guardian of the dead woman's son it's absurd and over the top but also entertainment <UNK> is terrific slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake she's made is fine if a bit bland although the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing fay baker makes a very good mrs <UNK> like caretaker wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty <UNK> clip he also stages a now classic out of control car crash with <UNK> or at least a stunt <UNK> at the wheel
<START> four holy young men from mormon country go to l a to <UNK> the <UNK> to urban <UNK> but one of the young <UNK> is a repressed gay who happens to cross paths with a very out young l a party boy what would film plots be without <UNK> these two very different young men become friends and in the process affect each other's <UNK> which in turn sets up an inevitable clash between gay and mormon cultures br br that is the premise of latter days a 2003 film written and directed by c jay cox himself a former mormon <UNK> the film's story is of course highly relevant especially in contemporary america variations of this story need to be told and <UNK> and <UNK> hopefully in future films because the underlying theme brings to light the <UNK> superior attitude that christian <UNK> too often display toward gays by its nature latter days is provocative and i doubt that the film was well received in <UNK> or even though the script is intelligent sensitive and insightful
<START> this movie was <UNK> extremely well when it was released in <UNK> during the middle of master fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250 000 copies and still <UNK> br br if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out it has a few old school videos and don't get me started with the freaky <UNK> <UNK> at the bonus ice cream party so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to <UNK> no limit fans from renting or <UNK> this video with your low votes
<START> ok so is a hunk but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted wasted oh the humanity br br poor sean <UNK> had to follow his master up the very same hills of new zealand that wait it be someone in the production crew of lord of the rings was making home movies in his spare time yes that's it br br i wish i could at least say he was promising br br the special effects were often laughable br br but was a hunk br br
<START> i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it i stuck it out to the end but it was painful especially having to listen to that voice of the child as 1 <UNK> even though the girl claimed to be from chicago she didn't have a chicago accent it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accent but failed at that as well i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child why did they <UNK> this one and why force her to talk like that it wasn't even just the accent it was the script the monologue created for her the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea <UNK> to me this era in history the type of characters that are poor and <UNK> the setting and the love triangle as far as i'm concerned it could have and should have been much better i was just <UNK> <UNK> to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is great you totally believe his character and it's scary as hell i spent half the movie covering my eyes the other half on the edge of my seat it's cool to see something this suspenseful and frightening that isn't all blood and guts but it did give me bad dreams br br basically this is a great movie see it the first chance you get
<START> this movie is very much like every other modern horror movie it's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen that's really the biggest disappointment of the movie that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort br br you can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie cliché it has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch one of these aspects is a <UNK> and very naive little kid why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies same goes for the sort of drama aspects that involves the family it just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective it often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch br br so it has all of the clichés present but it also doesn't succeed at bringing any of these clichés well to the screen as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one it doesn't handle its horror or tension very well for the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy the movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within the movie too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn't ever allow its horror to fully kick in br br the movie is also often way too dark no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget and it shows very little gore as well mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well br br you can just tell by looking at this movie that director j s <UNK> doesn't has much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to handle its present ingredients properly he did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far he just keeps trying unfortunately who knows perhaps with the right people behind the <UNK> like tobe hooper who was initially attached to direct this movie still could had been something decent br br it's a poorly cast movie with mostly big <UNK> in it biggest name of the movie is ben cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story it didn't even seemed like he had much fun playing br br just skip it br br 4 10
<START> this is the best of the films so far that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast previously they'd made the excellent waiting for <UNK> and following best in show they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind as for their latest for your consideration the less said the better br br the film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular you follow these few chosen dogs from pre show <UNK> all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the <UNK> <UNK> club however none of these people are real dog show <UNK> but talent <UNK> actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world amazingly even though the characters are rather outlandish there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are <UNK> as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very <UNK> group of people my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high pressure and tense <UNK> couple who just <UNK> anger and i also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever however the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from fred <UNK> who played the world's stupidest and least talented <UNK> in human history his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person how he got to be the <UNK> for such a <UNK> show is anyone's guess the other contestants featured were also quite funny the high <UNK> professional <UNK> <UNK> and its rich owner the country boy and his <UNK> as well as parents who could barely <UNK> together enough to make it to the show br br despite the improvised style of film making the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story one that is not for dog owners only exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade clever and consistently funny br br by the way try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing while a bit painful to watch i loved seeing <UNK> pepper and his beach ball collection in particular
<START> spoilers abound you have been warned br br i was thoroughly disappointed this being my first street fighter movie i have seen i dare not go near the 1994 joke yet very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero <UNK> as opposed to most the fights are hilariously done over board <UNK> versus was a <UNK> and the <UNK> is far too moody especially toward the end when <UNK> has to control everything in his fight against his brother br br the main street fighter <UNK> has been <UNK> to a far darker version inside of himself <UNK> in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother a shady street fighting <UNK> is held with more than just fighting on the <UNK> 's mind br br what is with the artist 's drawing of feet any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive the story 's soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent and places far more emphasis on a character <UNK> that is not even a fighter in the video game a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored how many times did you catch guy street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game
<START> oh dear br br i love science fiction but this er <UNK> just puts space flicks to shame every sci fi film i've seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree and i'm now seriously <UNK> what genre of movies i actually like in future maybe i'll watch romance flicks from now on br br spoilers alert and thats not saying much br br this flick is so <UNK> dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness the special effects are obviously fake the big mac truck looked <UNK> with its roller coaster seat <UNK> the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers a huge fat guy is sucked out of a <UNK> hole window butt first and space truck school wtf br br mr hopper can do better than this what really <UNK> were the two good looking young things who <UNK> him and run around in nothing but their <UNK> for an entire two thirds of the flick the obligatory <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly <UNK> on my <UNK> laughing at the tv screen br br the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain cyborg mad scientist he <UNK> the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy but i believe he could've been much more menacing he does and says things which are quite funny all the best scenes involve him so for the captain i give this movie an extra point br br but this flick is so bad it'll make you want to <UNK> abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a <UNK> state br br conclusion i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his <UNK> leg when its obviously a fake <UNK> leg i would've given it 0 out of 10 but since he cracks me up with his <UNK> antics this flick gets 1 10
<START> the <UNK> a detective story is very well planned and has a great storyline to go with it carrie anne moss plays <UNK> in this animated cartoon i really like the <UNK> <UNK> ideas created by the director
<START> after seeing this film i did not want my money back i wanted my time back i wanted that hour and a half back in my life it was the most amazing hideous torture to know that i had <UNK> precious minutes of my life on this dreck i am <UNK> for life and ever since this film entered my life i have had trouble sleeping i am trying to <UNK> the memories really i am but they make me want to burn things br br
<START> chaplin was great a silent comedian but many silent era stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first <UNK> in my opinion <UNK> voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous his career never <UNK> when sound came to film contrary to most of the reviews i have read <UNK> lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by chaplin the comedian and not spend their entertainment dollar watching <UNK> political commentary br br despite <UNK> awards and <UNK> i would take exception to his <UNK> to humanity the great dictator was made at the same time brutal <UNK> was having it's show trials and both <UNK> signed the <UNK> that lead to invasion of <UNK> by both <UNK> wwii started in an attempt to save <UNK> the <UNK> were defeated in 6 years but <UNK> disappeared as a <UNK> country this happened during the time this film was made and the <UNK> of hollywood by the federal government had chaplin included joe <UNK> in this satire in addition to including the italian dictator perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians the <UNK> of jews and <UNK> the <UNK> in time and numbers br br judged simply as a film many of the gags were too <UNK> to be understood by younger viewers who wouldn't know who <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> were a classic piece of art must stand the test of time classic greek tragedy the <UNK> lisa and <UNK> <UNK> are still enjoyed centuries after their creation because they are timeless films which rely on <UNK> political commentary or currently popular social views usually do not the generation in which they are made but those that address issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating from me br br chaplin as the writer director and lead actor must take the blame for what i judge as a dated and tiresome film br br <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous if chaplin found the us so offensive why didn't he return to his native land great <UNK> fought the blood and money what did switzerland contribute in the fight against the european <UNK> switzerland is like a country club that picks and chooses its members based on race and class and cares little about people who can't join the club
<START> this is a great little movie full of interesting characters and situations while not in the same class as some of the better known movies of its time it is still extremely watchable and memorable the scene where <UNK> scott sitting on a bus casually steals the <UNK> pin from the <UNK> of a coat thrown over the seat next to him is terrific it <UNK> his character beautifully a guy who's so low he'll <UNK> something of value to a war veteran to use as a prop in his various he lies easily as the situation calls for and <UNK> the women in the household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile br br i couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of mildred pierce scott and bruce bennett were teamed again and faye <UNK> bears some resemblance to joan crawford with her facial bone structure and large eyes also the <UNK> freeman character is not unlike the <UNK> <UNK> in mildred pierce br br i agree with a previous comment that the ending to the movie was too pat with the convenient <UNK> over a cliff for <UNK> mason <UNK> scott's character also in one of the final scenes we see <UNK> <UNK> freeman reunited with the boyfriend she had previously <UNK> in favor of the older <UNK> <UNK> scott i think the script should've called for her to be <UNK> for her behavior and for her cruelty toward her sister instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode but these are minor flaws in an otherwise enjoyable and well made movie
<START> <UNK> june 15 9 <UNK> the egyptian br br saturday june 17 11 <UNK> the egyptian br br he spent most of his life in pursuit of a good time and he caught it eric <UNK> br br harry <UNK> left brooklyn like <UNK> <UNK> i was fifteen eventually he ended up working as an <UNK> at the la paramount and within a few years fell back into one of the greatest <UNK> careers in the history of american music <UNK> is harry <UNK> and why is everybody <UNK> about him ' chronicles the legendary life of  the best <UNK> of our generation writer director john produces a <UNK> <UNK> of musical <UNK> from brian wilson and al to paul williams randy newman and ray cooper his voice was a medical <UNK> it would <UNK> you <UNK> <UNK> include his 1969 appearance on after <UNK> and bbc special the john lennon <UNK> alexander <UNK> brothers at the <UNK> comeback show <UNK> <UNK> is one memorable <UNK> among so many they seem to virtually squeeze enchanting music out of this <UNK> and bitter sweet bio doc br br he was a wonderful <UNK> br br  i woke up three days later getting a <UNK> in phoenix
<START> when i first saw this movie i was literally rolling around on the floor laughing especially when they were getting chased by the water and when the guy drove through peoples gardens i mean would it hurt to drive around the <UNK> line the special effects this movie clearly didn't have a big budget either that or the guy left his <UNK> in charge of the controls the water coming out of the damn looked like a close up of a can of beer that had up what were the actors thinking did they actually believe that it was a good movie or did they just really need the money not that they would've earned a lot when i first saw this i was like how old is this ' when i looked on the info about it and saw that it was made in 2003 i thought my tv was broken br br this really is a disaster movie in more ways than one
<START> this film promised a lot so many beautiful and well playing actors but with a plot that had virtually nothing to say so many potentially promising conflicts between the family members that could have been developed and <UNK> but it was all dropped and not taken care of there was no story to be told just a show off of acting technique beautiful scenes that were all empty but again the acting was excellent so many of the individual scenes were entertaining but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of <UNK> ideas even the acting lost its sense so from the promising start you became increasingly disappointed as the non story went along
<START> i would have liked to put 0 5 but unfortunately i can't who can write so bad scripts i saw the movie five seconds and knew the bad boy would be sutherland needed to pay his <UNK> when you see how good he was in <UNK> movie ordinary people and others br br though i don't like it but i had no choice i saw the movie in french but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen sutherland and hamilton would have not change things except maybe making it more pitiful br br what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff i forgot to speak about mr <UNK> far away from the woody allen's movies he once used to play in br br we had another movie on another french channel a silly james bond with brosnan i am not talking about the real bonds with connery please it's the end of holidays wake up
<START> if you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the villain not be more sympathetic than the victim and this fails miserably it was so terrible and frustrating to watch that i was actually moved to register and comment ok so the husband is rich and cocky there are worse <UNK> and the <UNK> boy and wife display plenty the husband is a jerk because he um didn't <UNK> of the <UNK> boy physically <UNK> that woman the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot btw the <UNK> boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife he then forces himself on her which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him uh huh the misogynistic <UNK> complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting it is one thing when a fine film like american psycho deliberately tries to get us to <UNK> with the villain but in survival island i felt like i was watching a movie about ted <UNK> but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims what was he thinking
<START> opening with some blatantly <UNK> footage from for <UNK> s o fails to live up to that classic cartoon instead we get an example of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> series at its most generic unlike chuck <UNK> road runner series which <UNK> to introduce new jokes to the same setting <UNK> series seemed happy enough to <UNK> jokes as long as the characters were in a different place s o then basically amounts to this time let's put 'em on a boat it's not an entirely weak cartoon there are a few good jokes mostly involving <UNK> glasses but they are <UNK> by gags you can see coming a mile off the <UNK> routine and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than <UNK> says i i a <UNK> <UNK> a joke that worked well once but has <UNK> returns s o will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid
<START> this movie kicks ass bar none <UNK> and his <UNK> have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd 4 days ago i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it i can't wait for <UNK> to come out in theaters if its anything like <UNK> it will be worth the wait br br thanks
<START> well there were some great <UNK> smooth facial shots of marlene along with her shocking gender <UNK> outfit plus her not to be missed from ape into human being but overall the generally unconvincing plot and dated acting not to mention the less than engaging tunes coming from miss <UNK> <UNK> voice did little to ensure blonde <UNK> a permanent place in my <UNK> <UNK> of memorable films cary grant still in the <UNK> of cinematic <UNK> seemed as though he was forever looking to find himself while herbert marshall was probably never anything but herbert marshall from the day he was born until the day he died naturally from an historical point of view blonde <UNK> was fun to watch so long as one was able to put aside great expectations
<START> great movie i was laughing all time through why well i am from <UNK> i can get along with the german <UNK> kind of humor so i guess this movie makes only sense watching when you are german native <UNK> <UNK> and both are talking in a new kind of turkish german accent which became really popular in our countries <UNK> but of course they are very stupid as in every comedy your personal humor will decide whether thumb up or down
<START> this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word i myself was a mormon <UNK> and i know first hand the wanting to complete my mission but at the same time hiding the fact that i was gay like the character aaron i was sent home for being found out and <UNK> but being the only mormon in a family of <UNK> wasn't as big a shame as it was for the lead character this movie really took me back to those days and helped me to realize years later how fortunate i was to have a family that accepted me and understood what i was going through i found myself <UNK> the end of a movie when aaron and christian find each other again by <UNK> chance at <UNK> restaurant i was truly moved to tears i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also <UNK> it a must buy
<START> i don't recommend you watching this movie if you are easily offended i'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated it's so disgusting and it doesn't make sense all the internet thing is so cliché and the producer obviously didn't understand all the internet rules when you chat with someone you can track their <UNK> address really see the sarcasm here it was dumb pointless and i didn't even watch the end i could always say this doesn't make sense this neither this movie is pure crap at his best nice comment right
<START> it's a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to <UNK> to lousy stories and scripts just for the money but hey it's a cruel world br br this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is sure it has some nice locations it's a slick production there is some good camera work and editing and it's fairly well paced overall br br so what's the real problem quite simply the whole premise is just totally unbelievable however instead of spoiling a rotten story for you i'll let you find out what it's all about that is if you can get through it i managed but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get better br br it didn't and it had one of the most anti climactic endings that i've seen for a long time in fact maybe never br br but it's harmless fun i guess if you've got nothing better to do
<START> i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007 and i see it is in development for this will be a shame as hollywood kicked writer director jules <UNK> out because of the infamous <UNK> they should not have the right to remake any of his films br br i love caper films and film noir and this combines the best of both br br tony jean gets out after doing a and after he beats up his old girlfriend marie he plans a big score with his friends mario robert <UNK> and jo carl what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas <UNK> nothing is left to chance br br the caper goes off great but marcel sends his sons robert <UNK> and pierre after tony and the gang after blowing it with mario they kidnap <UNK> son lots of bullets fly before it is over br br a great film by a great director the standard by which other caper films are <UNK>
<START> what a trip down memory lane br br do not look for great acting believable plot lines or anything resembling a quality movie br br this is pure <UNK> at it's finest outrageous outfits dialog <UNK> of women and the <UNK> cops you can imagine br br this vanity piece by the godfather of rap <UNK> ray moore who left us for good last week is the standard by which all <UNK> is <UNK> br br you not only see <UNK> at it's finest but get glimpses of his comedy genius and see why his records were kept under the counter
<START> where do i begin walt disney's <UNK> motion picture lady and the tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical <UNK> of disney animation the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie it was flame shield up adorable the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and i was <UNK> the songs for the rest of the night i can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs br br but where the movie was really good for me it was bad in a lot of other places the animation was kind of scary at times every time there was a close up shot of <UNK> face i don't know it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady she gets like two lines of dialogue and only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the end she gets 0 interaction with the plot and her only son br br but all in all i liked it compared to the original does it hold up no the songs aren't as good still kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved lady had almost nothing to do with it and it's not as cute as the first one but if you go in with an open mind you'll have fun and maybe ' like it
<START> i thought that this is a wonderfully written movie i love little <UNK> and the street wise angel this movie is very easy for little kids to understand but a good movie for adults as well i liked this movie because it continues the original lady and the tramp and that movie is a classic lady and the tramp 2 adventure was filled with new characters catchy songs brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters i have loved the movie ever since i saw it for the first time i also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character it also shows the <UNK> and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with my favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel i definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original lady and the tramp
<START> let me tell you something this movie <UNK> all of the troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it actually tries to come across as a serious movie from the terrible acting i knew it i knew she was possessed to the priest accepting sexual <UNK> and getting into <UNK> with naked teenagers this piece of dung takes the cake i am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad this may just be in a class all its own the <UNK> is that supposedly some <UNK> <UNK> production to make sure it was true to the actual situation i did not know that people from backwoods usa act like utter <UNK> i am not sure if i am upset for renting it or have stumbled across a jewel of comedy this was a very guilty pleasure so awful that i watched with hands over my eyes half the time while i wasn't laughing so hard i was crying the ending simply made no sense whatsoever pulling the whole thing together perfectly if you want to watch something so awful its funny here is your movie if you want a scary movie on <UNK> move on
<START> this is a wonderful family sitcom <UNK> <UNK> has appeared in to other excellent sitcoms the thin blue line better than this and <UNK> not better than this br br mr bean is a no talking human disaster he goes to places and gets himself in absolute mayhem the mayhem includes climbing up to the top diving board and is too frightened to jump off taking about 20 minutes until some kids eventually throw him off ending up inside a <UNK> machine and driving his car while sat on a roof bean drives a mini and has a teddy br br this was quite similar to the <UNK> man a series staring <UNK> fisher who says very little but gets himself in mayhem best episode do it yourself mr bean episode 9 bean <UNK> a new years eve party then gets some stuff for <UNK> his flat but has too much stuff and has to drive his car on the roof
<START> my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband <UNK> his <UNK> assistant and the oldest daughter getting <UNK> by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing it's a shock to me sometimes what people think <UNK> humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the <UNK> game bringing the issue of sex to the <UNK> in the mid 1960s sure the series has its touching moments still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the family oriented days of i love lucy some five decades before br br an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that <UNK> <UNK> think women can relate to character i absolutely dislike the character of <UNK> <UNK> daughter <UNK> she is best described as a <UNK> and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played <UNK> scarlett is like that in real life away from acting who plays the <UNK> ex husband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa is <UNK> in herself the characters of van and <UNK> are also very annoying br br something else that <UNK> me is why the <UNK> of a series creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from <UNK> texas <UNK> <UNK> isn't even from this state she's an why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig <UNK> what i mean by that is where we hear this <UNK> <UNK> being played with drums accompanying it but the <UNK> are basically <UNK>
<START> go fish garnered rose rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise br br its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms the entire film rings hollow i <UNK> the whole way through br br its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality well not much more here to be learned than from in and out by now most of us actually do know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both <UNK> br br seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style br br pathetic
<START> this is an <UNK> used line but it really sums up this movie if this is the current state of gay cinema then we're in real trouble i saw this film at because of the high imdb rating 7 6 and if there was ever a case of vote <UNK> on imdb then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film br br easy plot boy finds out his high school ex boyfriend is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown still carrying a 10 year old torch to see what happened br br first off i liked latter days the director's last feature despite its cookie cutter characters and plot <UNK> but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release i don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans robert <UNK> joanna cassidy <UNK> spelling but somehow he managed to the writing was lifetime network quality way back when they were really bad and the situations were unbelievable and <UNK> hard to watch i kept reaching for a non existent remote control to fast forward but ultimately made myself stay to the end hoping for a decent ending ugh no even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats br br to be fair the 2 leads especially in the gratuitous nude scenes were gorgeous there was also a real <UNK> between them during their <UNK> friendship as they <UNK> how they went separate ways and the film looked great good quality and color <UNK> for an independent film br br how is it that network tv can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes like ugly betty <UNK> etc but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this
<START> i saw a sneak preview of this <UNK> night with a group of friends and we had a blast after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman horrible 3 10 and <UNK> remake so so 6 10 i enjoyed this a lot more as seen in the trailer one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be forgotten but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it is br br my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get <UNK> etc and <UNK> that's hot but they didn't do that how could they resist br br there is no nudity from the 2 girls although paris looks great in her <UNK> i'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd hot token victim in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick i won't list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris <UNK> both get <UNK> up good br br the characters are developed <UNK> and are somewhat likable not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the 1st 30 minutes like most horror films br br i give it a 8 10 as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you'll have a good time br br <UNK>
<START> what gives anthony the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction first he destroyed the english patient which was bad enough but now i discover he's butchered cold mountain butchered br br i had such a strange reaction to the english patient my son and i went to see it the first weekend it was released and i was so disappointed but told my son i felt like i needed to read the book i drove straight to barnes and noble bought it read it and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie going public to give them a great film that is what he most surely did not do br br i do not <UNK> read a great deal of fiction but cold mountain was so highly recommended by friends that i felt compelled to read it i did not see cold mountain the movie when it played in theaters and it was because of what had done to the english patient but like a fool i rented it today and i'm so upset i had to <UNK> my frustration and most of all my sadness that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen and now they never will br br read the book and let the movie <UNK> on the shelf i will never be taken in by a project again i think he may be one of the worst directors working today and i'm tired of the praise hollywood <UNK> upon his head it must be that no one in hollywood reads anymore this movie bears no resemblance to the book except for the names of the characters ego must know no <UNK> and if he didn't like the book then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone even if i hadn't read the book i would still consider this movie one of the worst i've seen from 2003 and i've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the usa br br <UNK> you aren't going to like this one either
<START> the famous french detective <UNK> takes his first vacation in 11 years in st <UNK> where he meets <UNK> the daughter of the vacation spot <UNK> despite <UNK> being promised to childhood sweetheart leon <UNK> and <UNK> fall in love and decide to marry despite father due to <UNK> age on the day of their wedding leon returns and <UNK> runs after him nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead and <UNK> <UNK> he won't rest until he can find the killer the only clue <UNK> has to work with is a <UNK> found by leon but he is also getting written <UNK> that others will die soon soon mother is found dead and <UNK> has no idea as to the identity of the killer thinking himself a failure he returns to paris then he realizes and fears that the killer can be only one person even though none of his colleagues can believe his explanation out of the ordinary murder mystery that doesn't really follow the formula in other of the genre by columbia or other b studios credit to that certainly goes to director lewis who does manage to turn this into a <UNK> film despite the setting of the film also aided by the use of good camera work and lighting turns in a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the cast is able to carry their performance rating 8
<START> best club scenes that i have seen in a long time atmosphere <UNK> matthew performance is impeccable and <UNK> i would recommend this film to any age group watch out for
<START> it's partly bad luck for that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same <UNK> <UNK> of theater folk but a whole lot more <UNK> br br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets by a writer's life but there's a whole lot of orson welles ish ego in this produced by directed by lead acted by john <UNK> as a vehicle for his wife <UNK> with an adorable cameo by their son br br each actor gets his her moment literally in the spotlight but there's so many or set pieces that seem like 19th century <UNK> games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a <UNK> christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to <UNK> unnecessarily because this is an art film br br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written 8 21 99
<START> this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor for one the opening sequence does not put forth the element of <UNK> related subject if it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right secondly whats with all the <UNK> to the left and then to the right they even do it in <UNK> style nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar look for someone from the outside <UNK> like he is all that and a bag o <UNK> at a <UNK> and walk away without even being confronted let alone get <UNK> <UNK> i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself br br if this was made by college t a f e students then at least they gave it the old aussie try better luck next time
<START> i saw 2 hour version of <UNK> <UNK> i cannot say that is long the movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to <UNK> at any time the costume and the set are reminiscent of what we would see in old movies br br <UNK> <UNK> has done a good job of acting it is indeed a mature role with enough scope for acting within the story the script also supports the story very well acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage the movie is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the <UNK> condition of <UNK> in those times br br her best friend in this movie is played by <UNK> has also been well handled her innocence and her admiration of <UNK> <UNK> to speak english and act educated has been done very well these are indeed some of the <UNK> <UNK> of those times we can see how far we have come from such an era br br the movie speaks of <UNK> <UNK> as subtle line of the story i found the development of the story very similar to also written by <UNK> it does rope in some action from the independence struggle and puts in contrast the struggle for indian independence against the silent struggle for <UNK> rights br br a well made movie definitely worth watching <UNK> acting par excellence has handled the story with great care yet another classic from <UNK>

<START> john huston made many remarkable and memorable films those most often and easily <UNK> were released long before his passing in 1987 it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as <UNK> by his faithful adaptation of james <UNK> acclaimed <UNK> the dead br br once long ago a very wise man called doc asked me doesn't the dead seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in <UNK> i tend to think that it is the story and film both contain some of <UNK> societal comments and criticisms but for the most part paint a warm and loving portrait of an ireland <UNK> himself so often against and would shortly leave br br <UNK> handling of protagonist gabriel <UNK> who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion is simply remarkable to claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point as with any of <UNK> <UNK> plot while most certainly present is not the focus plot is merely a tool for the of the <UNK> <UNK> in addition to a seeming lack in action there is quite frankly little dialogue in <UNK> short story for the director to lean on <UNK> ability to translate what <UNK> puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie's greatest triumph feelings thoughts <UNK> <UNK> during the dance all these leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in <UNK> portrayal br br to claim that huston has <UNK> his writer's criticism of society again misses the mark while the dead may be painted with a cheerful <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of the film's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale we are the old aunts the embarrassing drunk the <UNK> with the sore throat the wife with the sad rain <UNK> secret even the self <UNK> middle aged man br br but the dead <UNK> its title it is not a dark story nor is it really that bleak forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it forget the <UNK> of a life gabriel <UNK> to at the film's end it is only with the destruction of the <UNK> gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward such is the central point of the film such is the central point of our lives
<START> flash gordon is undoubtedly the best of all american serials in a date so early as 1936 universal was capable of making such an entertainment story and twenty years later when i watched it for the first time as a kid it involved me in a great adventure and emotion buster <UNK> was the hero we always wanted to be in our childhood and jean rogers the beautiful girl we always <UNK> to be in love with dragons <UNK> monsters <UNK> were also the attraction charles <UNK> was a great presence as <UNK> the <UNK> a true predecessor of george
<START> this one and the one prior <UNK> revenge and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice it is basically choose your series the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers while the next three are a series of them being the good guys this one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series basically a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action japanese shows like the movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not <UNK> you with a very painful to watch movie just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie you do get to see the guy who played <UNK> in the last movie though then you have a very anti climatic battle and <UNK> the movie is over before it really begins
<START> george armstrong <UNK> is known through history as an inept general who led his to their death at the battle of little big horn they died with their boots on paints a different picture of general <UNK> in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes and <UNK> are mostly to his love for adventure br br errol flynn plays george armstrong <UNK> who we first meet as an over confident <UNK> at west point <UNK> <UNK> himself from other <UNK> as <UNK> a poor student who always seems to be in trouble somehow this never appears to bother <UNK> and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such <UNK> in spite of his poor standing he <UNK> and becomes an officer in the united states army through an error <UNK> receives a promotion in rank before this can be <UNK> he leads a union <UNK> into battle against the <UNK> his campaign is successful and <UNK> becomes an unlikely national hero <UNK> returns to his hometown marries his sweetheart <UNK> who is played by olivia de <UNK> <UNK> is a very supportive understanding wife who <UNK> stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes <UNK> of the seventh <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> becomes a man of honor who <UNK> to keep peace with the native americans to prove his intentions he enters into a <UNK> with crazy horse the leader of the <UNK> when that <UNK> is <UNK> by a conspiracy to spread a false <UNK> of gold being found in the black hills <UNK> sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent <UNK> br br errol flynn <UNK> each scene in which he appears he successfully portrays <UNK> as being flamboyant arrogant romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene olivia de <UNK> depiction of <UNK> bacon <UNK> as the love of his life lets us see his tender more gentle side the chemistry between <UNK> and flynn who had acted together in several other movies is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of <UNK> and his wife the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de <UNK> anthony quinn as crazy horse sidney <UNK> as general <UNK> scott arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining br br the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie while it is not historically accurate it is very entertaining the movie has a little bit of everything it has adventure comedy and romance so it appeals to a large variety of audiences the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land br br
<START> excellent performance there still are good actors around also great directing and photography very true to <UNK> and a <UNK> for all <UNK> fans <UNK> jason connery moved me to tears with his final <UNK> out brief candle out he gave the <UNK> of moral <UNK> and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting helen is a very credible lady <UNK> who can be very at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil if you love death and <UNK> and lyrics this is the one
<START> the d i 4 outta 5 stars wow i certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as i did i had never even heard of it until i saw it sitting in the <UNK> video bin one day i figured jack <UNK> playing an army <UNK> <UNK> might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie d i s as portrayed in full metal jacket or an officer and a gentleman boy was i wrong this is probably the best work <UNK> has ever done far and away better than his one note <UNK> performances the delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant done in his <UNK> deadpan <UNK> and yet you know that the guy means every word of it the story might seem a little hokey compared to the <UNK> military movies that have followed but i still found the movie fascinating and compelling even a completely unnecessarily musical <UNK> in an army nightclub had me hooked anyone know where i can get a copy of that terrific ray song you don't somebody else will <UNK> plays the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ever and he's under pressure to kick out the <UNK> private owen but by <UNK> he sees a man buried somewhere in that and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming great stuff
<START> this is a movie about the music that is currently being played in <UNK> <UNK> was the center of the two old world <UNK> the <UNK> empire and the <UNK> empire today it is a <UNK> of almost 10 million so it is to no ones surprise that a lot of music is being played in <UNK> with a great variety of voices styles and influences from everywhere on the globe it is turkish music of course and i was fascinated by turkish music ever since i bought my first record long time ago the movie features different singers <UNK> and bands spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern turkey for my perspective the most interesting comments were from furthermore the movies shows urban scenery mainly from <UNK> which is very pleasant to watch br br crossing the bridge is listed as a documentary and it includes music from <UNK> e g and <UNK> other important topics are <UNK> such as turkish jazz music or music of the and <UNK> br br this movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of turkey the <UNK> the eastern <UNK> and the middle east it may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as rock and roll or hip hop
<START> full <UNK> i was born in 1967 at first the premise <UNK> me after all if you were a teenager growing up in the age of reagan a trip down memory lane was worth a laugh or three pop rocks <UNK> and rock 'em <UNK> 'em robots loved 'em not despite the fact they were goofy but because they were goofy and silly and fun but when <UNK> decided to make the series i love last <UNK> i knew enough was enough goes hal sparks have nothing better to do than read from a <UNK> how idiotic are wait let me check hmmm no no it appears he doesn't <UNK> <UNK> uber hip <UNK> has its place but enough already
<START> another sadistic and ultra sleazy late 70's early 80's revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a rip off of other rip offs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders <UNK> this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director was to <UNK> the sleaze factor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly <UNK> loser running amok they <UNK> the male <UNK> and sexually <UNK> the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple <UNK> of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the <UNK> behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isn't unsettling at all on the contrary these spend more time <UNK> <UNK> their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever the villains are <UNK> and the train passengers are so <UNK> they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your <UNK> for blood and controversy will definitely not be terror express should be in the porn section of <UNK>
<START> i pride myself in being able to sit through everything i think if i've paid the rental <UNK> then i'm going to at least watch it i have found the exception to this rule the planet i don't know what the exchange rate is but reading through the other comments i can only guess that must be around 150 i'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old steve reeves movies of the 50's he was a <UNK> turned actor he was in these really awful italian dubbed movies that starred reeves as <UNK> or some other muscle bound hero as a kid watching them you couldn't quite <UNK> why these movies <UNK> you just knew they did mike mitchell is the new steve reeves that's it that's what this really was a new telling of an old italian spaghetti sand and <UNK> movie and i kid you not where was reeves born <UNK> montana this movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch it's just plain bad
<START> now this is a movie i really dislike it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie's purpose br br the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks what did they do to our favorite toys br br the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible br br i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for <UNK>
<START> ok here is the deal i love action movies and generally have no problem <UNK> a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions however this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous let me get this straight the police send a notorious gangster and cop killer along with a number of other prisoners on a bus with a grand total of two guards they then are forced to stop at a <UNK> where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire <UNK> got the night off for new year's eve right but wait it gets better gabriel <UNK> shows up to take out fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out although we never find out anything about their relationship or <UNK> interestingly the cops <UNK> the assault on the <UNK> are in full <UNK> gear with night vision <UNK> assault <UNK> the whole nine <UNK> later on they even bring in a helicopter with more people in full gear i'm not a cop but i'm pretty sure you can't just <UNK> out of the station with an entire <UNK> platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing and the police helicopter in the supposedly terrible winter storm also no one near the <UNK> happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash <UNK> and heavy rifle fire going off i mean seriously come on i know this is set in detroit but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission i also love the fact that they find a tommy gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and <UNK> br br i could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also for one the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and <UNK> way and i thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie unfortunately i was wrong the remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama the characters don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting there isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there isn't enough character development storytelling to make this a passable thriller drama the relationship between hawke <UNK> is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness uh i thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of detroit and suddenly we are in the woods the acting isn't terrible in this movie it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious i really enjoy some of <UNK> fishburne <UNK> other movies but this one is terrible
<START> un funny and un entertaining possibly the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch think goes to ' humour done even worse myself and my girlfriend sat through it just to see if it could be as consistently dire as it seems in the opening sequence yes it is avoid at all costs
<START> it's 3 <UNK> br br i just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it is fantastic br br a teenage girl has a night of passion with her mom's lover and it ruins everybody's lives the really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really place the blame on any one person br br everyone performed perfectly and the story was thought provoking br br you should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it br br i give it a 10
<START> a <UNK> gore i saw this piece of horrible <UNK> worthless junk at the cameo movie house now the famous night club on washington <UNK> on south beach in 1980 or <UNK> i was 17 and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible gross piece of trash the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly <UNK> <UNK> and sleeping in the place they didn't miss a darn thing the worst acting ever these actors deserve the academy award for the worst and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema joke was the theater was showing another <UNK> <UNK> lay a great name at least stinker <UNK> city enough said if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills over 12 you will be <UNK> after the opening credits it's just amazing that anyone spent a <UNK> on making this movie and to think it's considered a cult classic <UNK>
<START> i read the other comments here about this movie before watching it if you've read them you will know that they are almost all negative i really don't understand that i admit that it is far too long it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit the music is often inappropriate but strong performances by ford and thomas are indeed enough to carry this with all his fame as a movie star i'd forgotten that harrison ford really can act this role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable i find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was deception thomas is always wonderful and this is no exception her initial denial which leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous this movie is never going to be on <UNK> list of great flicks but it isn't that bad i'm glad that i waited to see it on video but it is worth the 3 or 4
<START> this was obviously the worst movie ever made <UNK> was the starring role in this movie and would be the only <UNK> for an award cause the plot actors and anything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous i could have made a better horror flick in my backyard within two hours with a hand held camera using grass stuffed <UNK> as the actors <UNK> the acting would have been better don't waste your time or money on this one it's extremely cheesy and horrible
<START> i have to admit that when i first heard about the apocalypse film it was a worry br br i mean they have a lot to live up to don't they when they first did a stage show they won the <UNK> award and when they did radio they won a <UNK> award when they <UNK> onto our they won a <UNK> award a royal television society award and the golden rose of <UNK> br br when the first series aired in january 1999 it was mind blowing a real breath of fresh air in british comedy and when the second series aired a year later it built on that foundation and sealed the shows cult status around the world our web <UNK> show that we have received <UNK> from every single country on the planet the show for local <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> talent for live performance and opened doors for the <UNK> to do more live performing such as <UNK> in the west end br br the fans favourite has always been the christmas special less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror films yet still wrapped up in the delicious league style br br and then of course there was the third series still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course but maybe a little bit ahead of its time for a mainstream tv audience br br as i say a lot to live up to br br so now we have the film and well a film is different isn't it it will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or tv shows and with the third series in mind i was worried br br well as you know i was lucky enough to get to see the film yesterday at a press screening in london and all my doubts were blown away literally in the first few minutes i am not going to give plot lines away as some reviewers have done nor am i going to tell you the catch phrases although there is really only one but i will try to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film leaving the cinema on monday night i could only imagine writing <UNK> my god it's brilliant its amazing its the best thing they have ever done better than the first second and <UNK> all rolled into one ' of course i owe my <UNK> a much better explanation than that so why is it brilliant this is a film for everyone the casual fan the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema you don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film it works on so many levels br br this film reminded me why i am a league of gentlemen fan you can tell that filming was a true <UNK> of love too the attention to detail is incredible the sets for the tv show were always detailed but i am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background the story moves at a swift pace the action carrying us from <UNK> <UNK> to the real world where we meet the <UNK> who are of course the league themselves along the way we manage to <UNK> into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the tv sketch show br br i was glad that the film was dark in places a little scary and a little strange only fitting for the league of gentlemen the <UNK> also managed to get their revenge on the bbc censors not as much <UNK> in the word as screaming it from the roof tops some may think the <UNK> portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry the in jokes i mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever but i shouldn't worry there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes they come thick and fast and in a mixture of clever references wig jokes bum jokes visual jokes and <UNK> gags i haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since well i can't remember the fans that have been the league since the beginning are rewarded with loads of <UNK> jokes some that work on two levels a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a <UNK> disc for one reason whilst fans of the local show will laugh for another reason altogether the cameos are genius peter kay and simon pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise i was a little worried about the aspect of the film when i first heard about it but as a story within a story i was just getting into it when but that would be telling all i need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film i am not a professional reviewer of films so i am finding it difficult to put into words how much i enjoyed this film but for now i will just say that if the supposed <UNK> for british comedy films in recent years was the excellent <UNK> of the <UNK> then i am sorry but a new <UNK> has just been set by the inventive hilarious and sometimes a little scary the league of <UNK> apocalypse br br jason kenny 2005
<START> <UNK> khan and <UNK> <UNK> films have never disappointed <UNK> le <UNK> is a romantic classic <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> was fresh and perfect to watch <UNK> remains as one of my favorite movies ever and <UNK> <UNK> was magical <UNK> though not the best is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned movies but definitely worth a watch and <UNK> who blew me away with an excellent performance in repeats a villain act and this time he gets an experienced <UNK> <UNK> and sunny <UNK> to support him br br before i comment on the acting it is not just the acting but the wonderful script that makes it worth a watch it is the writing that <UNK> the great acting the story is gripping but the characterization is what stands out the comedy track goes along well but the movie has the tendency of shifting at romance too much the viewer is bound to lose interest and you will make a couple of <UNK> but the movie is still good br br <UNK> khan is brilliant in his author backed role <UNK> khan once again is sympathetic and cruel you are bound to cry at the end <UNK> <UNK> is decent her screams are bound to become annoying after a while but in facial expression she is excellent but her ending scene she is brilliant though she was overshadowed by <UNK> she has an author backed role that makes her very likable sunny <UNK> is adequate his character was very likable but too perfect and it gets boring after a while he does a good job though <UNK> <UNK> is really funny but his role felt a little out of place <UNK> supports well br br the songs are enjoyable and come at the right time <UNK> <UNK> magic at your sight is my favorite song and presentation is very 90's film like <UNK> mere you are in front of me and <UNK> written here are nice love songs band <UNK> lo close the door is a decent love song also the <UNK> song is <UNK> to perfection as well as the naughty wedding song button the movie may not be perfect but it is well worth your time especially if your favorite actor is in it
<START> after an undercover mission in <UNK> to <UNK> an international gang of weapon dealers the agent griffith wesley snipes is assigned to protect the romanian <UNK> <UNK> the widow of an <UNK> of the romanian mafia however the cia safe house is broken in by the criminals and realizes that the information was <UNK> from inside the agency alone <UNK> only in his friend michael shepard william hope fights to survive and protect <UNK> br br the career of wesley snipes is downhill i have just seen this flick and it is another disappointing movie of this actor whose career is <UNK> very similar to steven <UNK> one the movie has many explosions shots and car chase associated to an awful story and horrible acting first the <UNK> american wesley snipes is chased by the police of <UNK> but they never find a black american man i have never been in romania but i believe there are not many <UNK> americans in this country his character does not like to bath wearing the same clothes along many days there is no chemistry between and the sexy <UNK> but she <UNK> has sex falls in love for him and shares her fortune with him the boy that performs son is horrible my vote is four br br title brazil o the <UNK>
<START> all the right elements seemed to <UNK> here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come you have the stellar cast michael douglas in an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role that pretty much launched his movie career fonda playing her typical <UNK> female doing her bit for <UNK> <UNK> and jack lemmon as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence give them a hot button topic about big business being <UNK> and that's <UNK> for a <UNK> but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing man's dream br br the script is <UNK> taut intelligent but mercifully keeping the <UNK> to a minimum and there is a genuine sense of <UNK> tension brought in play by the director as our three protagonists race to beat the clock if you like <UNK> dramas then this is not quite as good as the <UNK> but the whole thing is more than <UNK> enough
<START> shawn michaels vs edge 8 kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men edge whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring and shawn michaels is just <UNK> when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs <UNK> match 2 ok after a good opening match now this what a crappy match undertaker has given some great matches at the royal <UNK> and <UNK> royal <UNK> against shawn michaels was the same type of match but this is way worse then that match br br kurt angle vs big show vs <UNK> triple threat wwe championship 6 it's alright i feel all three men could of given a better performance this just really didn't show them at their best br br randy <UNK> vs triple h world <UNK> championship 9 triple h gets a clean win can you believe it sure he takes out the <UNK> but doesn't use it randy <UNK> did great when acting like he got a <UNK> but how he got the <UNK> is really ridiculous i really liked this match this was the best performance i've seen from <UNK> in forever br br the royal <UNK> match 7 this was highly entertaining and i usually don't score the royal <UNK> match this high the winner is again very predictable but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and <UNK> are hilarious the best segments i've seen in a while br br overall this is a great <UNK> and a must own for wrestling fans
<START> i've heard a lot about the inventive camera work and direction in this movie i thought both were a mess br br also some truly terrible acting the main <UNK> in the movie is irritating beyond belief and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation everything she does or says is stupid and she generally just seems to mess peoples lives up if she could fight i might forgive her br br overall all the women in this movie are stereotypical in need of a man to save them and all the men in this movie are muscle bound dim wits capable of saving no one br br this is a poor movie and i urge you to avoid it watch something like 'the sword of instead i hear its much better than this confusing mess of a film
<START> first i don't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any awards compared to la <UNK> which is also on a best list la <UNK> is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much the lead actor was annoying i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was bored even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting i wanted it to end as soon as possible why did it have to be his sister and cousin ugh and why did get mean he just turned mean and also was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in i mean this in all seriousness but does incest happen a lot in french culture european culture i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that
<START> this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it br br there are good class b movies and i do not reject the genre when they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality almost nothing is true in the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics just a cliche the effects are cheap and i do not care that the film is low budget you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films you do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not the only quality i could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film br br 2 10 on my personal scale the worst film of the year so far
<START> this is a film about a six year old child from a village in <UNK> a state in india and his grandfather who come to a city in <UNK> to treat the child's eyes here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation br br the movie is not a typical cliché indian movie so <UNK> expect to see songs or romance or melodrama this <UNK> a <UNK> crafted sensitive movie which <UNK> to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes the acting is superb dialogs heart breaking your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the <UNK> task of telling the child and his mother about the operation br br the handling of the subject has been excellent the film was made under great <UNK> by the director <UNK> who had to knock many doors to gather the <UNK> six million <UNK> budget even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by <UNK> some random shots of the boy's life in the village <UNK> definitely seems to prefer village life br br the acting by all is excellent as the social worker is competent adding the required <UNK> touch to her role <UNK> as the is great showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor as the child is a natural he doesn't seem to be acting everything about him is natural and does not seem forced br br but <UNK> above all is as the grandfather he is astounding in his role mere words cannot describe his work it is a performance to <UNK> forever br br is a sincere effort to make good cinema it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple the the results can be really surprising 10 10
<START> is an australian comedy drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name the story cuts between past events and the present day when the aged veterans plan a reunion this is a much <UNK> and controversial miniseries here in australia the budget ran over 6 5 million dollars historians and veterans <UNK> it's authenticity and critics <UNK> the uneasy mix of comedy and drama shades of pearl harbor series writer john doyle half of the successful roy h g comedy team has tried to defend himself with comments about the characters are of actual people the troops used comedy to cope with the situation it's only based on actual events one of our actors was actually there etc i don't have a problem with any of these points many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p o w camp experience king rat <UNK> merry christmas mr lawrence bridge on the river <UNK> paradise road empire of the sun blood <UNK> and a town like alice black comedy has often been used successfully in p o w dramas life is beautiful the great escape seven <UNK> <UNK> 17 the <UNK> story and even <UNK> heroes so why is a monumental failure the acting in is uniformly excellent the music and cinematography is good it is the writing and direction that have let it down every scene seemed to give me waves of <UNK> <UNK> when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun i thought didn't i see alec guinness do this in bridge on the river <UNK> the sudden flashes into surreal song dance brought back dennis <UNK> singing detective but without the <UNK> this <UNK> happened so often it <UNK> of lazy writing by cut and <UNK> rather than homage the constant <UNK> between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool here it left me <UNK> from characters where intensity was called for the is overdone every conversation seemed to include stone the bloody <UNK> such that i was saying i get the point i know they're <UNK> cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too sadistic young japanese officer uptight british officer <UNK> japanese <UNK> fun loving <UNK> <UNK> etc i thought i was watching <UNK> heroes on the river <UNK> after 3 episodes i'm <UNK> out
<START> well i notice imdb has not offered any plot info that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting because that's what this movie is vile and disgusting i watched it because i am a <UNK> fan of chris <UNK> whom i have met in person and he is a great guy but if i ever meet him again i will have no <UNK> about asking him whatever him to star in something so awful he plays a former child <UNK> who is now a brilliant doctor who spends his spare time running over small children with his car with the intent of <UNK> and <UNK> them this is not a spoiler because all this is made very clear from the <UNK> sickening enough oh it gets better he is manipulated into doing this by his incestuous sister who threatens to with hold sexual <UNK> from him if their latest victim fails to die even clive barker couldn't write anything so hideous please if you want to see chris <UNK> in something worthy of his talent rent teddy <UNK> and the
<START> i haven't read the book of this and based on this adaptation will not bother i hated every character in this show miranda was <UNK> selfish and <UNK> miserably through the appalling dialogue her sister was a total <UNK> and this was the worst depiction of manic depression i have ever seen i have a degree in psychology and this was not accurate in fact until it was mentioned i did not realise <UNK> was supposed to be <UNK> i thought he was a normal slightly grumpy teenager br br the only saving grace in this stupid show was david <UNK> whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half br br clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research <UNK> mental problems are not remotely accurate nor are the <UNK> involved in the twist ending and if you did not spot that a mile off you are a big <UNK> <UNK> br br utter garbage
<START> i love this show my girlfriend was gonna get an abortion until we both watched wonder one night luckily she killed herself before the baby was born though technically i think it was considered a murder suicide br br my first thoughts upon seeing wonder now i know what god watches when he <UNK> off all the time br br wonder is to television what a <UNK> in the <UNK> is to my self <UNK> br br you know how george w bush makes speaking <UNK> all the time tyler wouldn't <UNK> good tyler cuts his nails he's tyler he's good
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and i'm not a classical music fan the story of the tough street kid discovering classical music and changing his ways was great to watch without being sentimental or too unbelievable although some details had me scratching my head frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him where did he eat <UNK> did he ever get a change of clothes what did he feed his dog the owner of the school didn't think it was important to <UNK> the police about finding a missing boy but let him live in the basement <UNK> but we can let such unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the touching fun and slightly suspenseful for me anyway story and wonderfully talented children br br i loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps <UNK> the policemen from entering the school i doubt they would get away with that nowadays and i liked the nice touch about the boy frankie stole from turning the tables on him although that never really went anywhere and <UNK> friends helping him out in the end br br all in all a great movie for everyone
<START> enter the ninja 1981 was the first of several ninja films produced by cannon starring or co starring japanese sensation sho <UNK> but the star of the first ninja film was legendary tough guy franco <UNK> sadly not even mr <UNK> or sho <UNK> couldn't make this film watchable when you have two bad <UNK> in an action film and it's neither watchable or fun somethings <UNK> but i <UNK> skip this chapter and watch the next films in the series they're more interesting and a whole lot of fun br br next is revenge of the ninja instead of playing the evil oriental i use that term tongue in cheek mind you he's the star strange for a western film watch that one instead br br not recommended except for die hard sho <UNK> fans or cannon film buffs
<START> say what you will about <UNK> wizard of gore <UNK> gordon lewis it must be <UNK> that from his first films trashy blood feast and massacre two thousand <UNK> to his last <UNK> the gore gore girls the man remained faithful to his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up the bodies of young men and women for the of the camera in gore gore for example someone has been <UNK> the <UNK> faced and <UNK> clad <UNK> at the tops <UNK> club and obnoxious ex detective <UNK> is hired by a <UNK> <UNK> reporter to assist on the case the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music terrible lighting abysmal acting <UNK> characters <UNK> sound and of course some of <UNK> <UNK> gross out scenes thus one of the <UNK> has her face shoved into <UNK> oil one has her head ripped open another has her face <UNK> and her cut off and still another has her bum with a meat <UNK> until her entire <UNK> is covered with what appears to be <UNK> <UNK> i could be wrong here it might have been the film also throws out some fairly lame humor although some of the lines are pretty funny for example we learn that the real name of <UNK> stripper <UNK> was <UNK> a bottle of acid says made in <UNK> on it don't know why but i thought this was funny and some of strip club owner <UNK> lines are of course amusing still this is not the movie to show to aunt <UNK> or sister agatha it is one of the <UNK> you'll ever see with only one <UNK> crowd pleasing moment the title card at the film's conclusion that reads we <UNK> with pride this movie is over
<START> e <UNK> <UNK> experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in a clockwork orange but despite just how unwatchable this film really is it is a success br br if you are reading this and have not already seen the film then it is too late for me at least the payoff after 3 separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you was seeing the list of characters after the story was told that's when the simple message hit home but i wonder if could have told a 5 minutes story in about 30 instead of <UNK> br br however seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed <UNK> on the front page for this movie the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate <UNK> film making from the early 20th century even then you might <UNK> br br 4 10 but i <UNK> for crafted a piece of art even if it is unwatchable
<START> this movie was really bad it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring any die hard <UNK> fan will <UNK> like this movie but then again thats probably the only person who would see it someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of <UNK> la <UNK> before the scripted nature of that show wore thin to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played out br br a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan <UNK> guy whining and <UNK> skipping around like a merry <UNK> maker performance is strange at best it's a humorous little <UNK> canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like you're pretending to be foreign enough already br br maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero i love toilet humor as much as the next guy but this isn't even <UNK> its just stupid its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience even those <UNK> to and company are left out of the joke br br next time is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project
<START> i am not one to like those anime cartoons <UNK> pokemon <UNK> z <UNK> but bell is different in my opinion bell is more exciting has better characters and doesn't focus so much on a sort of weapon or as much as the episodes i've seen such as it the episodes big brother vs bell really focuses on the life of the strange the smart the clueless <UNK> and the weird bell is probably my <UNK> cartoon for now but i encourage others to watch 1 episode of it you'll most likely will like it br br <UNK> h aka
<START> it's interesting that someone made a comparison of the fifth missile to the star trek episode it should be pointed out that the original star trek tv episode in which the crew of the enterprise <UNK> a space madness while <UNK> planet <UNK> 2000 is entitled the naked time not the naked now the naked now refers to the first regular star trek the next generation episode in which the enterprise d encounters a science <UNK> this episode though does refer to and is based on the naked time original series one br br now to the <UNK> missile while the reactions of the crew in the star trek episodes were based on those similar to alcohol <UNK> the <UNK> condition on board the montana was caused by a much more serious situation namely the paint <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> finish there are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a crew who has <UNK> as serious as a crew on a <UNK> missile submarine and of course this is what makes the film so suspenseful and such a thriller the plot is very believable at the same time this film along with <UNK> tide the day after by <UNK> early light the hunt for red october ice station <UNK> and many other similar movies give us much insight into how easily things could go wrong and just how easy it could be for a nuclear holocaust to begin thankfully such an event has not occurred and god willing such an event will not happen
<START> possible spoilers ahead br br whenever fans of bad movies <UNK> for more than a few minutes a name that <UNK> comes up is that of larry <UNK> this amazing director has given us remakes of other <UNK> the thing from <UNK> cheap jack crime dramas like a bullet for pretty boy and <UNK> conspiracy flicks like down on us and goodbye norma jean the <UNK> <UNK> horror is a <UNK> to say the least <UNK> the fact that <UNK> <UNK> is extremely long and narrow larry filmed this <UNK> on a wide and round california lake early on the film boasts some dazzling for the budget underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself then it <UNK> into <UNK> dialogue <UNK> by no name actors with <UNK> scottish accents not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much <UNK> <UNK> at one point <UNK> sing you take the high road i'll take the low road just to throw in one more scottish cliche if scottish people ever decide to jump on the political correctness <UNK> they'll sue larry <UNK> over this film his <UNK> notwithstanding the monster looks like a giant <UNK> <UNK> puppet and it makes the dragon in cecil look terrifying by comparison in one unforgettable scene takes to land and to <UNK> some <UNK> soldiers the fifty foot long <UNK> tries to hide behind a tree and the soldiers don't see it the <UNK> <UNK> horror is a true mind that must be seen several times to be believed
<START> kathy ireland the body of a <UNK> the face of an angel the voice of a <UNK> br br and the acting talent of a <UNK> full of if you don't believe me check this out alien from l a actually depends on her to act throughout 9 10 of the movie sure she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a wrap around <UNK> near the end but that's too little so to speak too late br br seems ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls down into the center of the earth to find him along the way she falls for a guy named yes like the toilet paper make your own jokes and finds out how mad max rejects live did you know that people that live down deep in the earth have <UNK> accents neither did i br br it's bad it was after all and also a <UNK> <UNK> production but after all is said and done ireland just basically looks lost like she's trying to find where the <UNK> are so she can do a photo shoot instead br br and i don't blame her br br one star and if you insist on watching this do so with the sound turned off save your <UNK>
<START> let's describe larry as an <UNK> a complete in every way possible he laughs at all his guests jokes he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare <UNK> them he hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked by everyone friendly boring harry he probably owes his success to being a dream <UNK> for celebrities because they don't get <UNK> with what we the people want to know and have a right to know let's put it this way he interviews as if he's in a red country <UNK> 10 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as what's it like to be a mother followed by the usual answer along the lines of being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me it's wonderful but <UNK>
<START> this movie was really awful it was not in the least bit frightening or even startling i went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying the ruins ruined my night br br i would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident it is an absolute waste of an hour and a half br br the plot was nearly non existent the characters were horribly underdeveloped and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel
<START> of follows the story of helen and the <UNK> of the <UNK> war this is more of a love story between helen and paris who is <UNK> and falls in love with helen without knowing she is queen the film portrays the couple as <UNK> and wanting nothing more than to be together other films and books have different portrayals of the characters but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love the film is pretty slow moving in some places but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well there are also some good performances i thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most well liked characters br br overall this is a good adaption if you can look beyond the slow moving story in places and look beyond some of the cheesy romance and dialogue in my opinion a perfect <UNK> film version has not yet been created but this one is entertaining and does have some good bits
<START> imagine a <UNK> island set in the african desert in modern times add people nowhere near as <UNK> as the <UNK> or <UNK> and enough angst to fill a german <UNK> office throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only and literary <UNK> that never <UNK> deeply enough to truly satisfy season with a truly <UNK> topic that's been exploited since the first world <UNK> found themselves very very lost br br if the king is alive weren't a product of the <UNK> du <UNK> of <UNK> 95 would this film be <UNK> as much attention <UNK> 95 is to hollywood as danish modern is to a <UNK> of digital technology this <UNK> movement seeks quite <UNK> to strip away <UNK> in film making by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling pearl harbor for instance is the <UNK> <UNK> br br director co author saga <UNK> <UNK> relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life threatening situation eleven people aboard a bus riding through the sand <UNK> suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town an african local who does not speak their language serves as <UNK> and narrator whose insights are among the film's most <UNK> as the strongest heads off for a five day walk to the nearest village the others stay behind surviving on <UNK> <UNK> and their likely future as <UNK> former <UNK> henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a <UNK> and hand writes king <UNK> from memory he <UNK> roles and the group passes many days learning lines and <UNK> in an effort to <UNK> their attention from the seemingly inevitable br br gradually the cast begins to lose it and the of their william might say human to surface if you've ever seen lord of the flies you know that these things can get ugly that being in a <UNK> situation can turn even mother <UNK> into the <UNK> of <UNK> br br the film was shot using an international ensemble of american english french and south african actors who the <UNK> dogma <UNK> develop themselves and their roles quite <UNK> the king was also filmed <UNK> adding a sense of realism to the ever increasing desperation of its characters after up to three hand held cameras shot in digital results were transferred to <UNK> film br br the performance that <UNK> most comes from jennifer jason leigh who plays a pop <UNK> trying to <UNK> the spirits of the group in any and every way she can henry david <UNK> is another finely played character whose passion for his life's work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair it's hard to feel too sorry for the wives and their <UNK> husbands <UNK> old <UNK> french <UNK> wealthy men who have more important places to be than <UNK> in the desert <UNK> might hate this question but why is this group riding a bus together through remote africa in the first place life threatening <UNK> utter despair rendered in graphic detail a relentlessly tedious pace enjoy
<START> a friend brought me this movie and at first i was <UNK> the pace in the movie was so slow that it was admittedly boring at the beginning but the life scenes were attractive it's like <UNK> than watching br br it turned out to be simply stunning throughout the film the way how the director handled the life scenes to reflect the reality was <UNK> but somehow also overwhelming it's like understanding the real life of a lively person than watching a movie br br mr <UNK> and miss <UNK> did their roles so well that it's more like telling us their own stories indeed they used their real names in the movie
<START> disney like entertainment with some un disney like moments of graphic violence and sexual references lousy comedy alongside cliché ridden <UNK> <UNK> as abraham lot as his wicked buddy laughable special effects overdone acting with bad timing and were destroyed before the <UNK> strange twists and too many sub plots the bible doesn't mention god as a <UNK> father who just needs to be entertained by <UNK> before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster br br b movie <UNK> director john <UNK> adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction
<START> <UNK> only joking this was potentially the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through how anybody in the could have raised a laugh at this <UNK> rubbish is beyond my <UNK> i <UNK> not
<START> this film is what happens when people see like in this particular one blair witch project and say hell people running around with cameras acting slash documentary themed no i can do it and start out with a lame idea make up a terrible script and get a bunch of talentless actors and start shooting a film plot is that in africa there a a breed of man like animals who hunt and kill humans the locals think that it's a demon or a evil spirit but our wild bunch are in africa to get some proof of there own no need for more words on the plot this movie <UNK> a 1 out of 10 and i am trying to find something good to say about this movie but after a long time thinking nothing <UNK> zero <UNK>
<START> this film fails on many many levels the script is the first failing and as i understand it if the script stinks there's nothing that can fix that the plot is boring after the first 45 minutes i'm looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself how much longer the cinematography is pretty awful i'm not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd but it looked like a vhs copy also the sound was bad i realize this isn't going to get <UNK> for 5 1 but <UNK> it didn't even sound like it was in <UNK> <UNK> which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film br br <UNK> was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog it is extremely disappointing if i recall the <UNK> scene took place during the last 20 minutes usually it should take place in the first 20 most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes br br the film's music was excellent in parts and then completely inappropriate in others elmer did the <UNK> but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in <UNK> stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good <UNK> score with some <UNK> music br br there were great actors cast bob peck mark <UNK> ben kingsley bill paxton and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters well <UNK> character was pretty stupid and the whole movie was centered on him i'm not sure a heroic <UNK> is a good choice for the main character who carries the film again a major flaw with the script br br thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service and not the theater overall a major disappointment for sci fi fans or fans of paxton or <UNK> 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back
<START> rented this from my local blockbuster under the title <UNK> that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review br br it's a movie about the serial killer richard <UNK> who killed several <UNK> in chicago in the sixties watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter unfortunately that doesn't make for a good movie br br another problem i had was the near constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie and some god awful narration letting us know what's <UNK> <UNK> the acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste your <UNK> may <UNK> br br over all if you're interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time
<START> this was one of the best movies you could find as a child i lived with the <UNK> adventure from 4 years old to 8 years old the story of this film was <UNK> going on a business trip to europe and sticks the boys with miss miller while playing an around the world in 80 days video game two villains <UNK> and <UNK> brother and sister round the <UNK> and into an adventure in which the kids must hot air balloon their way across the globe what they're unaware of is that the game is really a diamond <UNK> ring and when found at the airport by the villains a chase ensues and which ends in <UNK> and <UNK> off to jail and alvin simon theodore <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> safe with dave and miss miller but i am warning you now this is a musical and quite a damn good one at that most people hate musicals but i am not one of those people i <UNK> love musicals like rocky horror grease sound of music cats don't dance and just about anything except for my fair lady if you see this share with your kids if you got any
<START> a wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden <UNK> without the hollywood fluff this all under the masterful direction of antonioni and <UNK> who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them <UNK> by the surroundings with long wide shots it is great to see that there is lust in the mid life <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i love movies all genres and from big dollar <UNK> to small indie projects but even making <UNK> for this piece of junk being 25 years old and its attempt at homage to the 1950's it just suffers in almost aspect by which we judge films br br throughout the movie i was reminded of several student films i've had a chance to watch efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where <UNK> are needed br br all in all chances are there are much better uses for 90 minutes of your life br br 2 10
<START> going into this movie i was a bit <UNK> i have always been a bit <UNK> about <UNK> movies i've always enjoyed decent animated movies but <UNK> was always different to me but this one caught me by surprise wallace and <UNK> are extremely lovable characters and it's a great story with jokes for all ages there's the silly <UNK> fart jokes for the kids and the subtle but over the head of young kids jokes for us older people very neat <UNK> and while the story had holes it kept my interest beginning to end br br it's so rare to find pure and humor these days this movie was all the more refreshing wallace and <UNK> go doing their normal thing which is <UNK> <UNK> the that ruin people's <UNK> <UNK> but this time they find themselves fighting some form of a freak huge rabbit that their <UNK> built traps can't even keep under <UNK> great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun if you have not exposed yourself to wallace and <UNK> i highly recommend this movie br br the only reason i rate it a 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and i don't have kids i enjoyed it but if i had been watching it with some little <UNK> rats and my wife it'd be at least a 9 for sure give it a shot
<START> <UNK> every moment of this <UNK> spectacle with music to match <UNK> is gorgeous but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd <UNK> so beautifully <UNK> in this film there are many aspects to this film but the main subject is the <UNK> force of beauty its spontaneous nature absence of logic for love and <UNK> i am also an <UNK> fan of <UNK> and believe he was rarely as wonderful try him in the servant however note i multiple viewings
<START> 1st watched 2 9 2008 4 out of 10 <UNK> j s <UNK> sexual political thriller that doesn't really succeed in any of these areas very well except early on where there are some interesting soft core scenes the movie starts off portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies amidst their work <UNK> or wherever and whatever suits their fancy the couple takes an <UNK> to a <UNK> and <UNK> where they run into a woman that's willing to be a part of a three some and fulfill some of their fantasies at this point we only know that this couple is well off but we don't know until they return that the fiancé is part of a well to do political family the man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a <UNK> seat after the marriage they then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit pictures of their encounter at the bath house and their begins as to how and why they were filmed who sent the package what they want and how to clear their names before any of this gets out this becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into <UNK> worlds and takes a lot of their time to the point where their friends family wonder what they're doing all day and why they look <UNK> all the time this movie is interesting at times but <UNK> into <UNK> as they personally seek out the problem instead of getting the police involved early on because of their pride this mistake of course keeps the movie going the performances are fine despite the no name cast but the <UNK> of the situation <UNK> and the movie starts to become ho hum about <UNK> the way through and of course they throw in a twist at the end that defies and challenges everything that happened prior as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to spice up the movie this doesn't help this movie one bit though
<START> i bought jack o a number of months ago at a blockbuster video sale and at the time i wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it upon watching it i realized i not only got less than i could have ever <UNK> for but a whole lot more as well it seems strange i know and it is but it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is jack o br br the movie follows a young boy named shawn kelly somehow thru <UNK> ties he is marked for death at the hands of a demented <UNK> wielding <UNK> man this <UNK> man was killed by <UNK> great grandfather uncle cousin etc and now that the villain has been <UNK> <UNK> death is apparently crucial to his hell <UNK> mission of vengeance anyway much horror ensues as jack o <UNK> his way thru various neighbors before battling shawn to the finish br br i'm not so much here to discuss the plot as i am to determine who may find any worth in this movie i can honestly tell you that jack o is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time the acting is deadpan except when it should be the script is apparently a 1st grade group project and the production budget must not have <UNK> 150 some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti thriller and they're all the more humorous when you realize director steve actually seems serious in his movie making br br and yet i <UNK> enjoyed the film i can call it a terrible horror movie yes but i can also say i had a great time watching it with my friends and have watched it several times since that <UNK> first viewing many people including some of my friends will find this movie <UNK> and needlessly time <UNK> and that's understandable if you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously you'll find jack o an instant classic which is also understandable br br that's why it's so hard to rate this movie if i were rating jack quality as a film i wouldn't give it anything in fact the studio would owe me stars yet if i were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment i'd give it an 8 or a 9 i'll give it a 4 so to be somewhere in the middle i recommend everyone go out rent this and form their own conclusion
<START> i don't think it's necessary to outline the plot for you because the site and other users have done a superb job of that already that said here's my take this is by far the worst movie of 2005 and there have been some really really bad ones i don't even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie bad acting bad plot bad directing bad special effects you name it if it doesn't stand alone as the worst film ever made it's tied with some other piece of crap i'd be embarrassed to have my friends know i was in this movie but hey most people that are gonna see it will do so no matter what reviews it gets so more power to ya when you feel the <UNK> void between your <UNK> two hours into your evening don't blame me
<START> this film did well at the box office and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce the frankly i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this <UNK> plotted unfunny comedy both lead characters have the maturity of seven year olds and are much less interesting to spend time with a veteran supporting cast including fred clark harry morgan and eva <UNK> lend excellent support and the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush and there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter br br i cannot recommend it started with a kiss
<START> if you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable storyline then perhaps this movie is for you <UNK> <UNK> smith jack warden and several other members of the supporting cast actually have talent but it was completely <UNK> by the paper thin script this is a generally boring and <UNK> time <UNK> of a movie
<START> i am afraid i will have to add my name to the long list of people who remain <UNK> that this film has still not <UNK> 2007 been <UNK> on dvd it's one of those mysteries that makes the mind <UNK> especially when you consider the amount of dvd's available today containing material that should have been years ago still i have an excellent digital vhs copy in english with subtitles and <UNK> so my <UNK> is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film as to the film itself this is an excellent all <UNK> with good picture quality more than satisfactory soundtrack lively plot involving suspense emotion sadness frustration feeling good and exotic surroundings for a european how true the film fits in with the reality in <UNK> i have no idea indeed that is less important the essential thing is that entertainment wise it is a success one soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and i admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing the river scene it's a shame we hear so little about countries such as <UNK> and this film at least gives some insight into the country has the situation changed since 1995 the events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a <UNK> no and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever not even <UNK> the lives of monks let alone women or children
<START> what is worth mentioning that is <UNK> in the other reviews i have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film while character is evidently gay he is not the only one the often talked about mr <UNK> scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason <UNK> to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been <UNK> by the police for homosexual activity a criminal offense in england at the time br br we can read under the surface that this recent event has <UNK> norman character and we can also see in a passing remark by the edward fox character the quick of any connection to such a person when the law is involved the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it the <UNK> of at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable <UNK> of his <UNK> from the list of those he gives thanks to the <UNK> combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that has to <UNK> into the as he does when he makes the <UNK> about the <UNK> air <UNK> a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment br br so while the drama is of the decline of <UNK> sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the <UNK> of <UNK> and makes this a film about him as the title suggests br br the art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war the <UNK> portrait of a society still <UNK> to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character <UNK> and ruined by the <UNK> of that order of necessity trapped in the <UNK> world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws
<START> if you're in the mood for a really bad porno with no good porn combined with a really bad horror movie this movie is perfect for you however if you breathe air make sure you spend your time watching anything but this the acting is crappy the plot is crappy they try too hard and the whole time i was waiting for the one good redeeming scene that might make the movie worth watching nope stick with the <UNK> cable
<START> chris smith is a superior filmmaker with the seldom seen talent for <UNK> a good story then getting the hell out of its way smith's american movie is the true to life record of filmmaker wannabe mark a loser intent on <UNK> his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror short but never under any circumstances to pursue <UNK> <UNK> or support the children he's conceived br br such is producer smith's skill that mark appears more sympathetic than otherwise even as he <UNK> uncle bill with sugar <UNK> dreams and executive producer credits it is his desperation to be somebody to have his name coupled with the likes of scorsese and spielberg that touches us br br american movie also belongs in that rare often attempted but seldom achieved sub genre that successfully <UNK> hilarity with horror the humor comes from ed wood style belief in his own genius from his appalling attempts at acting from his <UNK> his less than film <UNK> mother for a missing cameraman and from his <UNK> sweet but brain damaged friend mike whenever he's short an actor or crew member br br the horror comes from seeing what cannot it is this very american attitude i want therefore i am entitled that keeps him from seeing just how much he has to learn about his chosen craft he is so confident he can't fail that failure is guaranteed
<START> after seeing big fat liar i think jason learned a lot more when he told the truth about marty stealing his story it was like the boy who cried wolf people heard him but they didn't believe him nobody did anything to help him besides not only <UNK> movies stink so does his advice the truth is not overrated i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is everyone found out that he stole from that boy including his parents not only he stole from that boy and <UNK> about it he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own which is <UNK> doesn't he know that it is illegal to <UNK> someone's idea another reason why he got fired he is not <UNK> he's a liar a cheat a thief a crook and a <UNK> you got that marty you're a <UNK> plus you got everything that you deserved
<START> few videos in recent history have been as <UNK> produced as this one at least none that have been released by such a <UNK> <UNK> every frame of this film is a of better films of the past the word is given new meaning by a talentless writer director who should <UNK> his imagination for lesser <UNK> efforts that don't <UNK> film viewers <UNK> in the amateur night <UNK> effort is a number of less than capable <UNK> who contribute poor cinematography and laughable make up and special effects unfortunately the one or two of the amateur actors in the film who display a hint of talent that will go <UNK> due to the reputation that this atrocity will produce
<START> this 2 5 hour <UNK> <UNK> fest appears to be one of the <UNK> excuses for an adaptation ever clearly <UNK> a budget allowing for breathtaking location shooting in <UNK> the <UNK> might have been better spent working out a cohesive script with character development and motivations clearly <UNK> especially since bill has gone through the trouble of doing this already the portrayals lacked passion direction leaving the viewer <UNK> whether they should bother to care about the demise of the protagonists at all which brings out another point the main character of the original work <UNK> is not so named in this rendition despite the fact that most other characters' names are used <UNK> and magic are also <UNK> absent from this particular piece in fact all aspects that made the stage version of 'the <UNK> full of wonder and intrigue have been sucked completely from this convoluted version about a self absorbed pompous <UNK> who can't figure out how to care about anything beyond the <UNK> of his wealth and power over all a lackluster effort at best and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration
<START> i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow i would not think about going to paris because i do not like this country and its national capital i do not like to learn french anyhow because i do not understand their language why would i go to france when i rather go to germany or the united kingdom germany and the united kingdom are the nations i tolerate apparently the olsen twins do not understand the french language just like me therefore i will not bother the france trip no matter what i might as well stick to the united kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video <UNK> that is all
<START> if you like detective and police shows and you like suspenseful movies then you will love this movie this movie is great christopher <UNK> has amazing acting skills you may think you know who the killer is in the beginning but you don't this movie is about the true story of the murder of martha watch the movie
<START> the mere presence of sam <UNK> as an indian is enough to put this movie in the must see category he is both beautiful and very subtle with no lines whatsoever he is tender with his and yet we can see he is among the <UNK> of all young indian men martin sheen is just a dumb who decides to challenge <UNK> white bull for a gorgeous white horse other sub plots are really unnecessary i don't understand the part played by caroline <UNK> as the poor girl who white bull kidnaps i don't know how she keeps her hands off this beautiful indian man it's a lot of fun though especially if you're a <UNK> fan man he looks good in this one harvey <UNK> role isn't even worth mentioning to tell the truth but rent it and enjoy actually i do believe that if the music score was better it would've been a more dramatic film the music is so bad it's distracting still there's mr <UNK>
<START> some people go down in a cave for some reason and there's some sort of creature that's killing them br br i usually give a more detailed plot but i wasn't paying too much attention to this overall it was dull and the only time you'll be really paying attention is during the action scenes which the director did wonderful on br br the acting is alright but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind you'll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons 1 the kills are boring 2 the characters are boring br br the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was who br br so you're looking for a creatures in cave movie check out the descent instead
<START> and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice <UNK> <UNK> running around the so called african jungle so no problems there for most males out there br br i watched it as one of those <UNK> together package forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her <UNK> on screen at every opportunity possible just to give you a sense our heroine <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her <UNK> at all angles again no complaints br br the fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie on occasions when she has to fight the fighting involves rolling around in the dirt <UNK> <UNK> and basically fighting like <UNK> i am surprised no hair pulling is involved it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the <UNK> that i said the one that draw first blood wins in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting br br the witch doctor was a bloody blast from being a big <UNK> bear in the beginning he became manic <UNK> when captured and then outright psycho he spent the whole movie <UNK> lines with no <UNK> br br beside our heroine <UNK> around topless you also get to see plenty of other <UNK> as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons yeah it is that kind of movie br br watch the beautiful in her <UNK> glory despite the movie being more than 20 years old the <UNK> of watching blond women flashing their nice <UNK> on screen never gets old
<START> as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here i am absolutely sure that this film is great and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr the man you can see is him and his typical attitude to live and to resist death he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life you are lucky you could see at least one of them enjoy
<START> this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved it's always interesting to see the story from the <UNK> side for a change this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to <UNK> russia where one of the most notorious and <UNK> battles of <UNK> ii is being fought br br it's interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the in this movie those are given an <UNK> face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against at first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the are the evil villains but of course you get <UNK> to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them br br the way this story is told isn't however the best it's hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who it doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies br br the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasn't even shot in russia itself it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere br br the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic but i don't know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and <UNK> the drama and realism it also helps that they're being played by well cast actors all of the actors aren't the best known actors around thomas <UNK> was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality br br all in all not the best or most consistent <UNK> ii drama around but definitely worth a look due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of <UNK> and its good production values br br 7 10
<START> an inspired choice of director for this latest brit flick rose who burst on the scene with the budget free tale of ny <UNK> go fish brings a gently <UNK> view to this tale of a <UNK> choosing the slightly inappropriate <UNK> of a male bonding society to <UNK> his lust for a fellow <UNK> of <UNK> truths the highlight for me is a scene where the society try to <UNK> to being primitive hunter <UNK> but end up <UNK> a take away the film as a whole is wonderfully acted and who'd never be accepted by some of the lesbians she portrayed in her previous film <UNK> the bigger budget by <UNK> in some wonderfully lingering pan shots that contrast with go fish 's grainy a really enjoyable film
<START> <UNK> i'm kinda at a loss here i mean i know i liked death bed i know i'll be <UNK> the <UNK> of death bed to all my friends and <UNK> and if you're reading this i urge you to see death bed but i can't really say why perhaps that's the secret of its charm br br plot well sort of there's this bed that eats people and fried chicken <UNK> flowers <UNK> and any other darn thing that gets near it by sucking them inside its <UNK> fluid filled <UNK> amongst its near <UNK> powers bed has the ability to keep the spirit of <UNK> <UNK> trapped behind a picture to observe and <UNK> the events of the film various people then wind up at abandoned mansion habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an <UNK> reputation and lay down to have sex or take a <UNK> or because they don't feel well and get eaten sometimes having <UNK> dreams first and in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between <UNK> mom you had to be there and bed br br seems rather straightforward when i put it like that doesn't it well except for the <UNK> <UNK> part but something feels constantly off <UNK> and the story seems to <UNK> from one scene to the next even when <UNK> in cheap laughs or strange gore effects imagine crossed with bergman then left to <UNK> in a big <UNK> of <UNK> gordon lewis the tone of the story shifts from horror to fairy tale to comedy to existential <UNK> without breaking <UNK> an incredible achievement for a no budget student film shot in the detroit area br br all in all an astounding little film that quite probably no review can ever completely do justice see it for yourself
<START> i was unfortunate enough to see this movie at a <UNK> house what an utter waste of time what an utter and complete piece of crap this movie is absolutely nothing is funny in it from the shower scene to the insulting and <UNK> portrayal of germans there is no plot the acting made me gag and at the end i personally wanted to beat john <UNK> with a stick i thought john woo movies were bad this movie is officially the worst movie that i have ever seen
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen and believe me i've <UNK> a lot of bad movies i love horror but this was just terrible there was not one scene in this film where i felt scared all the actors must have been people that they found at a bus stop 20 minutes prior to shooting i wish that would have given me my 99 cents back the acting was terrible the writing was incredibly bad someone had to screen this movie before it was released and had to know that it was terrible i'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this monstrosity don't rent this movie if you do don't return it so no other poor souls will ever make the mistake of renting it
<START> i first saw this film by chance when i was visiting my uncle in arizona about 3 and 1 2 years ago the vhs print was a little faded looking but i was very haunted by what i had watched did it all make sense well honestly no it didn't however this is a film that requires more than one viewing to understand all of its aspects the beautifully tragic score haunted me and the bizarre images made quiet an impression br br well when i found out that anchor bay had released this <UNK> on dvd i picked it up immediately i was very pleased by the transfer though i felt the extras rather lacking though the film concerns the o and sir stephen characters it really has nothing to do with pauline original novel or the 1974 film the story of o however the film does pay attention to artistic detail and symbolism of an almost <UNK> kind o decides to prostitute herself for sir stephen in violent 1920s hong kong her mission is to prove her <UNK> devotion and love for her master through giving her body to other men naturally sir stephen enjoys watching her during her unpleasant sexual <UNK> and even finds himself a mistress however the tables are turned when o actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer suddenly sir stephen feels the threat br br i feel that the deep meaning behind the film including the tragic score and artistic direction really make this film a classic the viewer is introduced not only to the lives and <UNK> of o 's fellow <UNK> mates but the turmoil of 1920s hong kong is also explored like the political setting the prostitutes all find themselves in need of <UNK> no one is happy in the film even if they believe that they are however o does find a sense of happiness with her young admirer one prostitute <UNK> remembers how her father used to act like a dog when she was drunk naturally leading to a fetish for having her customers act like a dog another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress she cannot let that vision go she treats her <UNK> as co stars and even <UNK> she hears a piano in the river br br as for o she has a flashback about her father leaving her in a <UNK> circle when he leaves she feels a sense of <UNK> of course in that same flashback kinski suddenly becomes her father i was very very disturbed by this image i truly felt for o at this point in the film she hardly ever smiles and this scene really explains why her fear of <UNK> is so great that she sees sir stephen as her father and <UNK> to his every obscene demand in hopes of proving her love br br another curious aspect of the film is the young child that ages at the end that sells fortune in a box it is a very random character but somehow it just adds to the sense of loss and <UNK> in the film at one point the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people now if that isn't symbolism for you laugh br br all in all i really love this film i feel that it is a very deep and somewhat moving experience it has erotic scenes but the scenes aren't really meant to <UNK> like the lives of the characters the sex acts are empty they are motions but lack feeling and <UNK> once again the only tender scene is between o and the young man o believes she is in love and that <UNK> herself is an honor however she finds in the end that she has choices she too can be her own person and pursue her own happiness however she also has the option to stay in that circle that her father drew the director leaves a lot of unanswered questions however some things don't need answers the viewer will make the judgment that works for them br br i must say that i wish a special edition of this dvd would be released that had director commentary i think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion of the film and its message years later it is a shame that the soundtrack was never released this film has a truly haunting and heart breaking score there is something about the lingering <UNK> that send a chill up my spine i can truly feel the sense of loneliness in the film by just listening to the music
<START> it took me a few years to hunt down this title a major <UNK> of my childhood almost every trip to the video shop i'd pick out space <UNK> and watch it three times every time my mother rented it for me it was i suppose my star wars br br it's a shame then that it's such a stinker my memories were so <UNK> that it offered nothing in terms of nostalgia so i had to take it at face value a crew of space pirates accidentally kidnap a pretty annoying little kid and spend the rest of the movie trying to get him home br br aimed <UNK> at the under <UNK> it's got <UNK> slapstick very shoddy costumes and make up recycled special effects <UNK> sets and poor acting but even with the unintentional comedy it's no fun to see it as an adult where i can pick out not just the technical faults but wonder at how spectacularly the writer and director managed to <UNK> an endless stream of no <UNK> fun powerful moments that have been seen in a million other sci fi movies and in the hands of anyone remotely competent should have been successful br br i imagine as a kid i probably found it quite <UNK> there are lots of i can't do this i'm just a kid sure you can you just have to try type <UNK> the kid drinks beer etc but even by low budget 1983 sci fi standards this one's pretty awful with a real <UNK> of a finale
<START> this is a total piece of crap it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert they have <UNK> the story and characters the acting is average to bad the only character done right and played well is duke <UNK> played by william hurt unfortunately he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there not that its a very tall hill to begin with br br the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch i was not overly impressed with the movie but considering the technological limitations of the time they tried their best amazingly the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison it was at least somewhat true to the book which i really love br br they had the chance to do it right this time sadly it was not taken
<START> i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies this movie just did not move me i felt like it was about one hour too long <UNK> is portrayed as a very sympathetic <UNK> who loses just about everything i thought the whole movie was just sad and <UNK> if you like <UNK> you might like this i just thought it was too long which meant it has many unnecessary scenes which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom i would not recommend this movie if you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch titanic
<START> a severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing guy <UNK> so fantastic as andre <UNK> in part three barely features this time and richard <UNK> <UNK> them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film for the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of <UNK> bay <UNK> gordon <UNK> and some youth friends of his many of the cast are canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather <UNK> roles <UNK> hill is quite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the egyptian god want the secret of animation life back and the puppets when they surface act with a previously unseen <UNK> to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking <UNK> the <UNK> merely <UNK> the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in top scene is <UNK> using a <UNK> to clean blood from <UNK> bit classic and about the <UNK> this film goes the fifth film was filmed <UNK> with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a <UNK> performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era or even galaxy guy <UNK> deserved better and series fans certainly do
<START> i was watching the perfect storm and thought about another <UNK> peterson film which is much better this one although certainly not based on a true story in the line of fire is how a movie should be made it has a terrific story with a great cast <UNK> won a well deserved oscar for his performance as the creepy killer with a grudge against the government he served all too well eastwood is good as the tortured secret service and russo is easy on the eyes if you haven't seen this definitely rent it or buy it as i did definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade 9 10
<START> the best movie about friendship especially between an aids infected person and a normal person this is a great movie for everyone to see even though there is strong language used i have seen it 25 times
<START> i generally won't review movies i haven't seen in awhile so i'll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film in the case of 'a sound of thunder ' i remembered my <UNK> of never seeing this movie ever again so i'll just go on memory in fact i haven't thought of how badly made this movie was until i read someone else's review and remembered the experience i had back in 2005 when i actually saw this in the theater my movie buddy forced me to see it though i wasn't interested and wow later on i forced him to see <UNK> instinct <UNK> in the theater reminding him he made me see this crap so i guess that made us even i certainly had my share of deep laughs at the movie's expense of course which didn't make him happy as he really wanted to see it the time travel <UNK> effect film had so many bad graphics the <UNK> chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur god i loved seeing that <UNK> and them actually being scared of it  it was hilarious or just simply ben kingsley it's great kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be going from <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to uh this even a meryl streep can do a <UNK> <UNK> from time to time so they're forgiven for months i pulled an mst3k with my buddy consistently <UNK> this movie to any low rent sci fi film or kingsley flick yes the movie would be a great movie to see drunk or otherwise <UNK> horrible over the top acting special fx that even the would turn away and ridiculous plot twists the biggest disappointment was that the <UNK> didn't even <UNK> this film for any award
<START> this movie is like happiness meets lost in translation with a sixth sense ending or maybe a crying game surprise and the best soundtrack i've probably ever heard if that all make sense br br the first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride i was surprised no one walked out right away during the brooklyn premiere but from there the film <UNK> down into a talk fest between two really damaged people daphne and buddy br br they're lonely mess up and boy do they talk about sex daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of <UNK> some are quite funny mr chang some disturbing the <UNK> scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what's going on or what daphne is really feeling and because i have a friend who used to <UNK> i might add most seem quite real br br you are alone is multi layered and mostly brilliant okay maybe a couple minutes less of the talking and i don't know that we'd have missed anything br br then again i need to see it again knowing the ending br br i like this movie br br the director asked people in the brooklyn audience to write a review on imdb because a lot of people read them request granted
<START> i really liked this film about love between two adults in <UNK> britain the high standards of bbc tv is evident in the production and superb lead actors claire bloom and <UNK> <UNK> make this an uplifting experience bloom and <UNK> have previously worked together in theatre and their chemistry and interaction is splendid i recommend this version of <UNK> over the film version of 1993
<START> this is just about one of the dumbest things i've ever seen maybe not a worst movie ever <UNK> but if you haven't seen that many bad ones this could easily make your top ten worst list when you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original king kong you've got to ask yourself why anyone would <UNK> so low as to produce this <UNK> then taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to star wars the following year achieved a new level in sci fi entertainment this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time br br now let me ask you what would possess the professor peter cushing to bring along an <UNK> as a prime piece of <UNK> research equipment for the ride to the <UNK> core ok so it was useful in <UNK> off the parrot <UNK> in the early going but come on somehow i don't think this is what edgar rice <UNK> had in mind when he wrote his tales of he probably didn't have caroline <UNK> in mind either as princess <UNK> probably the only redeeming factor to this whole <UNK> br br at least there was one bit of pseudo scientific explanation that i got a kick out of i'm always looking for one in films like this that would have to be how the sky at the <UNK> core was really the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> explaining that <UNK> <UNK> glow but try as it might the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about the sly one or the ugly one much less those goofy half man half <UNK> creatures to <UNK> the good professor you cannot <UNK> me i'm paying attention
<START> any batman fan will know just how great the films are they've been a major success batman returns however is by far the best film in the series a combination of excellent directing brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in br br tim burton who directed this movie has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job danny <UNK> penguin man is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby and grown up to become a hideous and ugly thing michelle plays the <UNK> and very <UNK> after cats had given her there <UNK> from being bitten the result in both the character changes is excellent and both <UNK> and penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film the mysterious <UNK> is great fun to watch her classic <UNK> and a funny part in which <UNK> with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film danny <UNK> also does well his ability to <UNK> some strange creature was vital and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull <UNK> where he lives br br you can't forget batman though micheal keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance and shows us a different side to batman his affection is let loose when he confronts <UNK> at the end of the film and his <UNK> with her when she's a normal person <UNK> kyle result in him being <UNK> badly in his own home there's a clever part after this when they leave and the film is full of great scenes its worth noting that bruce wayne's bat mobile is not used as much as in the other batman films as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film br br the winter setting is created perfectly in <UNK> city with most of the scenes being set at night and with the town being filled with snow therefore if you watch this film during the summer like i have it doesn't feel the same best watch it during the winter br br overall its an amazing movie all the credit goes to tom burton and the cast they've done an incredible job
<START> i remember seeing the trailer for this film and i absolutely knew i had to see this movie it looked like something that would be right up my alley br br the united states of <UNK> is a terrific movie it is not one that will leave you with a nice pleasant ending but with a sad empty feeling instead and when i say it will leave you with an empty feeling i do not mean that as a bad thing i believe that you are meant to fill that empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and <UNK> general motives and how they act as parts of society br br ryan <UNK> is perfectly cast as <UNK> he is intelligent yet stoic i like the way that he <UNK> the film with his <UNK> the supporting cast is terrific as well kevin spacey is very good as always and don cheadle is amazing as teacher and mentor br br this was a great story and is very smart and thought provoking i highly recommend it
<START> i bought this a while back during a massive martial arts movie phase although this certainly ain't the best i do love this kind of film making and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of my favorite martial arts stars i always appreciate the fact that whilst he lacked <UNK> martial arts training he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance he also has a good beard this movie has him in a good heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies he still <UNK> himself well early appearances from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fat are also nice too see especially for the fact that <UNK> <UNK> fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play he may not be a great fighter but he does ok eddy <UNK> is as great a bad guy as ever he performs the same as in many of his other films and does it great as per usual the fellow who plays <UNK> is good too i don't recall his name but he's in magnificent butcher too although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era the <UNK> fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance there are some very nifty scenes good characters and a good <UNK> mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect all in all i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans it may not be a <UNK> classic like the shaw brothers films or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee but it is rock solid entertainment
<START> a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the closing credits this was such a film the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever <UNK> quality br br forget the low budget that's <UNK> by a slow monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential with no crowds no traffic or location discernible forget the <UNK> logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible forget that roy <UNK> delivers some of the <UNK> dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame br br this <UNK> is terribly paced <UNK> by a score that's simply laughable and seems edited by a third <UNK> all the while <UNK> scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap making him seem presidential br br i honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel and when i <UNK> i ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame try this drinking game take a shot every time you see it blatantly <UNK> another much better film you'll <UNK> off too br br not since 'the man' w samuel l jackson and eugene levy have i seen such a delightfully <UNK> project i may give out copies as christmas gifts zero stars a thousand laughs
<START> i am still not sure what the hell this movie is about i guess the boy was afraid of becoming blind and began imagining all sorts of strange things this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new baby brother however or the <UNK> boredom found within this film while watching this movie you will wish you were blind so you did not have to see this experiment in <UNK> skip this steaming pile and <UNK> for anything else at the video store anything else
<START> when i saw this movie three years ago i thought it <UNK> a lot of the traits found in <UNK> art house movies slow moving with a minimal of plot and dialogue depending on film composition to make it work br br during then amongst local <UNK> the inability to appreciate be with me is <UNK> to <UNK> citizen kane or any of <UNK> late films i've no idea how be with me reached such <UNK> heights in cinematic consciousness but i always felt that 12 is a better film even though the latter film does not <UNK> as good a cinematographer as adrian <UNK> <UNK> for be with me 12 has a story that better relates to most <UNK> and has bite too something that be with me 's <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have br br be with me is basically a barely <UNK> trio of <UNK> strung together into a film by and his screenwriter wong kim it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance two girls in a relationship and the story of deaf and blind <UNK> chan br br be with me is very well filmed by <UNK> using a camera the film compositions are masterful the film almost entirely silent has next to no dialogue characters move around not in a realistic manner but almost as if they are models under the <UNK> of a director almost always looking into the screen and <UNK> either loneliness or sadness unfortunately the characters don't act against each other this kind of film has been seen before many times in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> films in <UNK> <UNK> 4 30 and elsewhere sadly its ultra <UNK> essentially plot less and use of a piano soundtrack simply doesn't appeal to me br br to criticize be with me seems almost to <UNK> the inspirational story behind it that of <UNK> chan who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this yet i'm afraid this film doesn't do anything much to me i'm willing to applaud chan's <UNK> and courageous march in life and striking cinematography but for a better take on the same subject matter with more meat without the two other tedious and distracting subplots try <UNK> <UNK> land of silence and darkness 1971
<START> i remember watching this mini series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and <UNK> having read the comments on this title i must agree with those from the people in <UNK> this was produced to <UNK> with the 1984 los angeles olympic games and to me it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in <UNK> flag waving american <UNK> in which the american <UNK> are <UNK> at everyone else's expense some other <UNK> would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series it may however help to explain the way in which many american <UNK> <UNK> at the 1984 los angeles <UNK> and the tv coverage which seemed only interested in events that americans were likely to win
<START> my wife and i find this movie to be a wonderful pick me up when we need to have a good laugh the conflict between some characters and the between others make this a sure fire comedy relief i am so looking forward to this movie coming on dvd so i can replace my well watched vhs
<START> i have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with the problem in dark reality is you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and <UNK> he ended up <UNK> up the film from start to finish you can tell the film reel quality itself is low but the poor lightning and shaky camera only hurt it further by <UNK> what is going on the sound is <UNK> and often times not understandable i'm sure huston the director would argue this was to <UNK> a state of panic in the audience but he had more than ample material in which to do it having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome br br the story is good a basic sadistic female <UNK> story that avoids cliché by keeping the girl's in a state of despair the whole time for good reason billy bob from silence of the <UNK> treated his victims better than the biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly <UNK> the lead character in her mind and by the second time they showed up i was fast <UNK> as this was attempting to destroy the only decent part of the film br br in the end the way the director <UNK> it together showing random <UNK> things and constant barely <UNK> scenes not because of horror because of the lighting angles and camera ultimately destroyed this film huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it <UNK> a bad film school project if you want to see a decent story then it's all right but be warned the film quality is enough for most to turn it off
<START> this is an excellent b film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy it is about a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in outer space can it get more unreal it is a hybrid between alien and chain saw massacre the movie was shot in <UNK> with a mixed cast of americans and <UNK> that interact beautifully director martin does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources <UNK> has all qualities of a b film horror movie it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause it is great to see that movies like this can still be made i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films
<START> i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and <UNK> the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team this is so bad it's funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime i'd recommend it highly as a comedy as for being a serious movie i'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2 br br don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be found br br edit hmmm i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down don't believe them this is a really crappy movie
<START> the creative team that brought us police squad and the naked gun derived from it said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode basically the show was never given any chance typical hollywood the contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it most shows are presented on tv with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc br br the humor of the show is extremely dry it uses no laugh track and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to <UNK> an <UNK> on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery br br those familiar with the naked gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting between the show and the films in the films <UNK> developed a particular take approach that is eyes <UNK> when confronted with the unexpected this doesn't happen in the show where <UNK> is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves nothing is unexpected to him also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of mtv finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid in the first episode to re <UNK> the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles the hard way this is actually a <UNK> bit of humor since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than <UNK> this sort of thing rarely happens in the films br br taken <UNK> each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the naked gun films since they are both more <UNK> more happens in a shorter time frame yet more <UNK> paced there's not the rush for a punch line as sometimes happens in the films there are some inconsistencies that happen in the films primarily 2 and 3 that never occur in the show's shorter time frame br br of course there's no doubt that naked gun the first film is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema and if you watch the tv show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance br br none the less it would be useful to have a dvd of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks if laughter has as some claim <UNK> value watching this show is good for one's health
<START> the <UNK> is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but it's nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while of course they gave the award that year to terms of <UNK> after all they don't want to be accused of showing too much taste br br albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of king <UNK> tom is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the it's both hilarious and <UNK> to see character <UNK> <UNK> with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly <UNK> and <UNK> even up to the very bitter end finney and work wonders together and though finney gets the <UNK> moments he does get to <UNK> shakespeare after all is the heart and soul of the film br br grade a
<START> was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non participants in a documentary and why all the silly dog scenes and then <UNK> of all the same silly dog scenes this film starts with a great promise to expose the international politics and the business of wine it got off to a great start and included all the right characters but the production is a mess points started and developed most of the way then never finished or left with <UNK> ends very poor and <UNK> camera work and editing they should have used subtitles for the british <UNK> from <UNK> br br too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary br br probably <UNK> at cannes because of the us bashing although in my opinion there was too little of it br br we left at the 2 00 hour mark i have no idea how much longer it ran on
<START> blade is probably one of the best vampire action movies ever made it has it all action horror blood this movie is for action fans it's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it it means you don't like action or vampires movies wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade
<START> i was thrilled by the fresh pun intended synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place the <UNK> the movie looks fantastic colorful yet simple magical yet genuine unfortunately it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative sappy tale <UNK> a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by nice <UNK> <UNK> and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people br br the characters particularly the <UNK> ones are very comic in nature the story focuses mainly on two <UNK> families one of them is headed by a single mom played <UNK> by henry i am <UNK> to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were <UNK> by what was <UNK> bad acting br br the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children all are <UNK> by their journey to this country by way of <UNK> where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most <UNK> wong gives a mind blowing performance here at first his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops he subtly makes us aware of the inner struggles of his character br br unfortunately the rest of the movie is just extremely boring there were so many possibilities with this movie there are several characters to keep track of many of which might have potential but none of it is realized even worse despite this movie being very much not <UNK> some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b grade way example br br character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem let's have character c <UNK> her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending yawn br br i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family that was well done unfortunately the whole business the <UNK> aspect of it the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited br br what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth
<START> probably this is the best film of clint eastwood here action is minimal but with plenty of good acting a <UNK> soldier eastwood is wounded and taken by the female <UNK> and teachers of a school in the south where he is hidden and taken care shortly after his <UNK> all ladies wanted to have fun with him and some of them succeeded including the director of the school <UNK> page erotic scenes are coming until the ladies discovered that their macho was shared by several of them so they became angry and <UNK> him in a farewell dinner <UNK> page although somewhat old was able to play a very suggestive role as the director of the school a woman with more failures than happiness in her life
<START> i remembered this awful movie i bought at <UNK> music store in the summer of 1989 when i was visiting my grandparents it was a time when i had just discovered movies like re animator from beyond the return of the living dead and dawn of the dead i was ready for all the horror gore genre had to offer or so i thought i was only about 12 years old at the time so i really don't remember it all that well i remember a psycho running around with a <UNK> killing people and a couple of cops i think who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving but being <UNK> side to side to look like it was true <UNK> i also remember it being the worst film i had ever seen up to that point and i promptly threw it in the garbage br br something tonight made me think of that movie i can't believe i actually remembered the name so i jumped on imdb to see if it was listed to my surprise it was and a full other 5 people have seen it amazing even though i remember hating the film at the time i sort of wish i had kept it hidden away somewhere because i'd love to check it out again for a laugh it would probably make a good drinking game movie anyway i'm glad i'm part of the elite few that's seen this little treasure i would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks but beware this is not a recommendation it is awful it's just for nostalgia
<START> the knowledge is a typical british comedy for the period to someone who is not familiar of the process of becoming a london <UNK> the film is bound to seem very average with a few laughs from a few old faces br br the knowledge however comes into its own for knowledge boys like myself or their wife's who know what these poor individuals are going through and find yourself comparing incidents of your own to that of the characters
<START> as a film buff i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film my favourite being woody allen's <UNK> if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon therefore i've never been able to watch it without <UNK> at the choreography set songs etc just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation he really enjoyed it and after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film so did i there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies it isn't even especially camp the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to <UNK> at them as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since <UNK> olivia <UNK> and peter <UNK> were dubbed brilliantly too as the <UNK> match their speaking voices perfectly and sally <UNK> has a really lovely and totally unique singing style <UNK> <UNK> with olivia <UNK> on the things i will not miss is excellent special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles <UNK> brilliant performance as the high <UNK> and his comments about mankind destroying itself are <UNK> apt to today's <UNK> world i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and bobby <UNK> question me an answer number which could easily have been cut but if you haven't even seen lost horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is
<START> anyone who enjoys the <UNK> weirdness of twin peaks or any fan of <UNK> <UNK> who knows that the most frightening things are the familiar things will really enjoy this film don't watch it as a horror film in the traditional western sense but more like a <UNK> fairy tale it is gory and definitely for 16 but once you start watching it you too will find yourself drawn into the <UNK> definitely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching i'll never look at my <UNK> the same way again
<START> i'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film when i first watched this i couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the <UNK> attention it did at the time br br unforgettable performances by the young and wood should have made this film a classic br br although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy drama by the original writer director evans once <UNK> took over he presumably made it with a more <UNK> <UNK> especially the ending which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby was he killed did he escape really do all those fantastic <UNK> or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kids br br but in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film perhaps it's because it's not just that br br to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official <UNK> wood site where you'll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie presumably by the original writer br br also a note of the music by hans <UNK> which is one the best <UNK> i've ever heard a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie a great cd to get hold of if you can br br
<START> billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles <UNK> the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in <UNK> jimmy stewart plays <UNK> and while he might be a bit too old for the part he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down to earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star wilder directs <UNK> <UNK> the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what <UNK> was up against when he decided to take this challenge it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work but it is a gem of a movie it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american overall it is just plain good
<START> man i went to this movie because of the great preview it looked like it had a great story and nice special effects br br boy was i wrong i wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects a cartoon <UNK> of <UNK> board would do even a better job then this the story was fine if it would have been taken on by a big movie producer who would in some more money to make the effect more life like the only thing i liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere br br even worse where the cars in one scene 2 characters walk along the street if you watch those cars you'll see the following taxi car motorcycle <UNK> <UNK> big bus and about <UNK> in a row br br and then there is the <UNK> death that would set the whole evolution changes in to progress if that guy didn't step on the <UNK> the next <UNK> would have eaten it anyway so that's absolute bull then if you change something in the past the future will be different in the same instant not in those time waves they made but hey if the future changed in a split second the movie would be even worse but more realistic though this is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh i spend way to much money on this movie in the theater and then they tell me this movie had 80 million dollar budget where did all that money go
<START> jim <UNK> strikes again with the very literal minded <UNK> vs <UNK> no <UNK> here a giant cgi <UNK> dragon it sort of looks like a dog minus fur takes on a <UNK> cgi king <UNK> with a bunch of tree <UNK> and others caught in between the tree <UNK> get <UNK> boat captain michael <UNK> who else to take them to an off limits federal island an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large has become an experiment in growing very large <UNK> thank so to our nutty military now all that's left on the island are the very large <UNK> and the mad <UNK> tiny <UNK> daughter the group runs into her at the old plantation lab the monsters arrive and the chase is on if you watch enough <UNK> sci fi channel flicks you'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies acting is nonexistent as is the plot at the very least you can enjoy watching the badly animated dog <UNK> down on its intended victims just before <UNK> them up the <UNK> just strikes and <UNK> no imagination at all
<START> after sitting through this god awful <UNK> minute excuse of a film and having previously wanted to <UNK> my eyes out after having watched another james directed mess called when will i be loved i've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world how else can these horribly written painfully directed pieces of trash get made in the first place br br i like robert downey jr but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse br br heather graham has to be embarrassed about her <UNK> performance half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a <UNK> br br such a crappy script prepare yourself for hollywood name dropping <UNK> example five minute meandering discussions on denzel <UNK> acting etc br br there's a great character in joseph <UNK> novel catch 22 named <UNK> he spends most of the time in the novel shooting <UNK> which he <UNK> when asked why he shoots <UNK> all the time if he hates it so much he replies that it makes time creep by and he'll have a longer life well if you really want to feel time creep by watch this film i swear the <UNK> minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour david lean epic it goes on and on and on and on br br i hope i never watch another james film again if i could give this no stars i would
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is often credited for <UNK> the cannibal <UNK> with jungle holocaust in 1975 but director <UNK> usually acknowledged as a <UNK> rip off directed the man from deep river 3 years earlier in 1972 is it a worthy start for the genre well not really br br a photographer accidentally kills a man in self defense and while <UNK> into the <UNK> of an asian country is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive force him into slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the <UNK> daughter throughout the whole film i never felt this was a horror film it was more reminiscent of a drama like a man called horse which i liked better <UNK> <UNK> is pretty good as the photographer but it is me me <UNK> as the <UNK> daughter who is memorable and great i have always been a me me <UNK> fan ever since her breathtaking performance in jungle holocaust and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films she is still very talented and charming lots of real animal <UNK> is the one thing about deep river that could make it a horror film but even that doesn't <UNK> well br br the man from deep river is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal <UNK> but as an entry in the genre is easily <UNK> by <UNK> entries and even <UNK> own later entries recommended only for <UNK> and me me <UNK> fans
<START> in the opening sequence of where's <UNK> george segal rises from his bed one morning <UNK> <UNK> puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's bedroom we realize later to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever this is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture insanity <UNK> with what might be taken as morbid daring br br segal plays a new york attorney who lives with his supposedly <UNK> mother ruth gordon whose life is further complicated when while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag meets the girl of his dreams the pleasantly <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> out like <UNK> <UNK> his dilemma how to <UNK> the lovely nurse into his and his <UNK> mother's life br br <UNK> performance is about the only thing holding the picture together his <UNK> his reactions his comic timing is almost <UNK> whatever happened to that guy where the film fails is in other areas ruth <UNK> characterization is dreadful as the mother at the beginning you can't figure out if her character is <UNK> or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out by the end it's clear she's just nuts when segal brings van home to meet her <UNK> <UNK> and she gets a mean sinister look she wants the intruder in her son's life removed she's <UNK> this is not the mode of a <UNK> person you're not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture which is probably the director's carl <UNK> fault as much as <UNK> ruth <UNK> old lady in <UNK> baby is much more successful because with the kind of <UNK> <UNK> person that ruth gordon generally plays the audience responds to her as annoying but when <UNK> <UNK> is too <UNK> to fight back gordon becomes more <UNK> her <UNK> dig deeper and deeper and we're frightened for <UNK> this kind of <UNK> is genuinely terrifying here we're being asked to laugh at what we'd normally find annoying and if gordon played it as <UNK> nutty all the way we might but she's selfish and mean as well and it <UNK> what little humor there is br br there are a few good laughs though a courtroom scene with <UNK> hughes as a military officer and rob <UNK> as a <UNK> punk is fairly hilarious and vincent <UNK> does a nice turn as a football coach there's also an inspired bit where <UNK> brother ron <UNK> having been stripped naked by <UNK> on his way to <UNK> place asks him for something for to wear home and he gives him the gorilla suit br br but of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesn't make sense why is a new york lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place why does segal if his mother is <UNK> try to reason with her <UNK> if you spoil this for me i'll punch your f ing heart out why does <UNK> keep cutting through the park if he knows he's going to get <UNK> why does he take a taxi after leaving <UNK> with gorilla suit why wasn't he taking <UNK> all along a funnier bit would have been <UNK> as the gorilla <UNK> the <UNK> why does van keep coming back after her first husband was a <UNK> why does she want to get involved with this bunch i suppose if i put this to carl <UNK> he'd say are crazy people they don't have to make sense ' which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that's full of holes the characters' moment to moment behavior may not have to make sense but their motivations do and that's where where's <UNK> falls apart the situations are created just to have the gag and the gags are mostly one shots they don't build to anything br br carl <UNK> is the most guilty in this whole fiasco how he has acquired this <UNK> reputation as a <UNK> of comedy <UNK> me basically his career has been to hold a <UNK> in front of sid <UNK> and mel brooks while they talk in funny voices his son rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director in show <UNK> terms <UNK> pushes buttons a monkey could do his job and that is most apparent in his framing of the action why is all of new york shot in tight and in close ups but the scenes in the country are all distant and <UNK> that's the mentality of carl <UNK> direction claustrophobic for the city <UNK> for the country in the final lunatic scene at the old folks home the camera is so far off you can't even make out what's going on the abrupt ending suggests a resolution that segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago it also suggests <UNK> couldn't figure out how to end the picture so he just cut it as another example of <UNK> <UNK> seems to think <UNK> equals <UNK> and <UNK> without logic is always funny it isn't and the creators of where's <UNK> are as demented as ruth gordon putting <UNK> in her fruit <UNK>
<START> i laughed at the movie the script the acting please don't we deserve better but now the filming some of the camera angles were interesting i did enjoy the film but it's not to be taken seriously though i liked it if it had a new cast and it would be better than all right it's worth a look
<START> i found this dvd in the store and figured why not support some <UNK> film and watch a cool horror flick please save your time and money and pass this one by the acting the script practically everything with this film is sub par there really isn't much of a story and there is no character development i found myself not caring what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened everyone is supposed to be college age but they all look like they are in their mid thirties except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she is pushing 40 in fact the worst part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a master shot there is no editing no cut ins or close ups do yourself a favor and skip it
<START> ever since he played a <UNK> in lone wolf actor <UNK> kane <UNK> has been busy his film <UNK> got all the publicity last year but he still makes a couple of more films every year he should have <UNK> this one br br <UNK> seems to be the king of the slashers he has played jason <UNK> from <UNK> friday the 13th part <UNK> the new blood 1988 to jason x 2001 he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for blood br br however there wasn't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law <UNK> on a e br br i won't put the blame entirely on <UNK> shoulders as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either br br michael <UNK> the hills have eyes the devil's rejects just ran his mouth until <UNK> shut him up <UNK> the bold and the beautiful was cute veteran actress <UNK> company and <UNK> pet <UNK> barnes did a credible job i am sure there are other horror favorites but they all just seemed to run through their roles
<START> i don't think i've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college just to impress his parents nowadays movies are either remakes or sequels or plots that have been used in many different films this one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only <UNK> the deal with this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in this is a good movie now i've seen better but upon going into the theater i was thinking another drug beer frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in aka an american pie flick but i was surprised to sum it up i enjoyed the film and the next time your <UNK> through the paper for movies look for show times to accepted if you want to laugh out loud that is
<START> wretched talk about <UNK> beyond the <UNK> adventure is bad in every respect michael caine and karl malden decide to <UNK> the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really <UNK> <UNK> boat they're challenged by ruthless telly <UNK> and his gang of machine gun <UNK> <UNK> this part sequel part remake has caine malden and another group of <UNK> survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship among this group are shirley jones slim <UNK> peter boyle shirley knight and slim <UNK> jack warden plays a blind man surely you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess sally field is particularly annoying as a <UNK> on board <UNK> <UNK> br br disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one he decided to direct it as well
<START> a rather charming depiction of european union beginning to operate among the young generation as <UNK> of that group learn to live together in an apartment in <UNK> where they are all studying on international central to the story is <UNK> who may have lived a rather conventional life with his mother in france but who quickly becomes a leader in the group helping them deal with <UNK> and other problems he learns about life and love rapidly has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance the rest of the cast also play well occasionally they all <UNK> into english when they want to make sure they are <UNK> uncertain about all their apartment <UNK> ability to understand french or danish or whatever the languages may be cinematography noteworthy including fine views of <UNK> and its famed towers
<START> animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful canadian film this short feature is dripping with canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by <UNK> most of all but the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer <UNK> it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again so i simply had to write a <UNK> recommendation for it this is a masterpiece and a must see whether or not you are canadian
<START> a hugely enjoyable screen version of <UNK> <UNK> best selling pot <UNK> about the trials and <UNK> and naturally the loves of a group of women involved in one way or another in the new york <UNK> business directed by jean <UNK> fairly fresh from the success of three <UNK> in a <UNK> and the prototype for the likes of sex and the city except that here the sex all takes place off screen br br the bright young female talents of the day hope lange diane baker <UNK> parker martha <UNK> are all nicely cast while joan crawford pops up as a queen bitch of an editor who could probably eat meryl <UNK> miranda <UNK> and spit her out with absolutely no effort at all she steals the movie the men include stephen <UNK> louis if it wasn't <UNK> <UNK> it had to be louis robert evans before he decided wisely to go behind the camera and brian there are more <UNK> on display than you will find in your average but if like me you enjoy desperate <UNK> not to mention carrie <UNK> and company then you will probably love this a very guilty pleasure
<START> more exciting than the wesley snipes film and with better characters too the last vampire hunter must save los angeles from a <UNK> of vampires out to <UNK> the city aided by a <UNK> journalist lost of fun and the names of the characters are great
<START> jewel thief is the crime thriller of bollywood and why should it not be it is directed by the biggest <UNK> of the crime thriller art in indian cinema <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i could watch this movie for any of the following reasons in order of importance br br 1 <UNK> <UNK> direction 2 r d music 3 <UNK> <UNK> 4 5 <UNK> kumar 6 lyrics br br even if jewel thief is not a bond movie it definitely has bond babes helen <UNK> and the mysterious and some cameos but our <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is anything but bond he is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are he even <UNK> with <UNK> trying to hit her romantic nerve just so that he can get employed in her father's shop br br <UNK> <UNK> might be in a double role well i don't want to spoil your movie or else i would have told you that is what most of the mystery is about <UNK> <UNK> works in a jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work though is not or at least has a perfect <UNK> we wonder who did it is it <UNK> <UNK> as the person he claims to be or is it someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike comes who even claims that he is her fiancé in a tense situation <UNK> <UNK> has to prove that he is <UNK> and not <UNK> while everyone wonders if <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> or <UNK> he is asked to remove his <UNK> <UNK> we are told has 6 <UNK> on one of his foot while we watch with <UNK> breath the events that are about to unfold <UNK> <UNK> even finds time to joke br br the real life brothers director <UNK> <UNK> and actor <UNK> <UNK> have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in crime thriller br br there are moments of hitchcock's north by <UNK> but the movies are very different except for the confusion about who is who a <UNK> female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity <UNK> <UNK> could very well be <UNK> in addition to being <UNK> people have seen him they identify him where ever he goes there are too many of those people for this to be a fraud finally <UNK> thinks it is better to carry along with being <UNK> to find out what is the truth and it is a sad mistake he gets too deep into it only to be saved by the twists of cinema br br when i watched the movie as a kid i was definitely not amused the ending confused me completely even now there are parts about the ending that i do not like but i'd recommend this movie anyway br br even as a kid i enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer <UNK> ' a definite <UNK> song in <UNK> voice i could hear <UNK> ' whole day long <UNK> for <UNK> which is set <UNK> the of at least the story line suggests that among the <UNK> song to come out of hindi cinema featuring <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and we <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> ' now could there be any better thriller of a song than this as the song progresses we are more <UNK> than we ever were and the words in <UNK> add to it
<START> sure the concept had already been done with <UNK> and the thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters but i loved both shows and watched them <UNK> until they ended in 1990 when i learned about <UNK> i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the 90's so far hadn't impressed me but at least star trek <UNK> and the simpsons were still going br br what i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing i can't blame them too much for what they had to work with there were a few humorous moments but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time in the 80's it would have fit right in br br still it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series so i gave it the benefit of the doubt the second episode wasn't as bad and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its <UNK> the show would improve sadly my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired i never got to see it and the series disappeared from the tv <UNK> after that all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape
<START> feeling <UNK> directed by steven and starring keanu reeves cameron diaz and vincent <UNK> the strained relationship between two brothers sam <UNK> and reeves is pushed to breaking point when arrives at <UNK> wedding and makes off with the bride <UNK> diaz a former stripper marrying sam to <UNK> a gambling debt <UNK> to night club owner red <UNK> writing and directing debut is a frustrating mess full of hateful characters and lacking <UNK> putting keanu and diaz in the same movie should at least provide some eye candy but even cops out on that score <UNK> his actors up with little positive effect very poor
<START> scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad <UNK> or are afraid of the dark however most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done i thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking it reminded me of the original pink <UNK> film
<START> if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film then you need to watch this i myself with no film making experience could do better the script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure in order to make up for this flaw you would think the action would be decent wouldn't you br br as the acting editing and overall <UNK> together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor the reason why he is the saving grace is because he is so genuinely bad at acting that he should win an oscar for it at least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much br br toss in a dead woman's body after an all male shoot out where did she come from pull the semi automatic trigger <UNK> of times while the pulls off two <UNK> effects reflection of the camera crew in <UNK> mo <UNK> shades one and only one music track for the whole film an unoriginal script that has no logic is a perfect recipe for a really really bad film its actually more fun <UNK> the errors than actually trying to find something positive avoid at all costs
<START> this movie started off great the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters that's the good news the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid br br what we wind up getting is a santa claus with magical powers with a lot of new age <UNK> thrown in the mix it's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of christmas movie i would expect from jim ernest br br to be fair it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity free but just not a film i could recommend
<START> what impressed me the most about one true thing was how up front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie as depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being <UNK> with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2 3 into the movie love story terms of <UNK> etc br br meryl streep <UNK> <UNK> and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge the characters they play seem human they're not perfect people arguably one might not say that about the martha stewart type character streep plays but throughout the film i found her character to be noble in a non sappy way she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how br br one true thing is an <UNK> <UNK> family drama in which the tears at the end were well earned
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> novel john <UNK> has <UNK> events eliminated a number of characters and generally implied rather than shown essential <UNK> if you want a more explicit rendering see the 1945 film <UNK> and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers this story really treats of a theme similar to <UNK> dr <UNK> and mr hyde but note that <UNK> chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas took the scientific route both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the end br br the actors in this bbc movie take a different route too from those in the 1945 film john gielgud says all the same <UNK> and cynical <UNK> as george sanders in his role really <UNK> <UNK> himself but with a subtle difference you'll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes peter <UNK> too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we don't get to see as many of his <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> had a chance to display br br it's a very good production with the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the novel if not all of its <UNK>
<START> under the assured direction of f gary gray italian job never loses its grip on being cool and fun although the material is <UNK> and average the film itself is masterfully executed and is <UNK> good the tone could easily have been much <UNK> considering the murder revenge <UNK> but f gary gray keeps the tone light by good humor snappy dialogs and <UNK> music it is a pleasure to see these would be bad guys form a great bond and stick to <UNK> through <UNK> and murder while never forgetting to have fun this one is 7 10
<START> i had heard of john garfield but didn't know him i loved this movie i had never heard of it i just picked it up randomly john garfield is a boxer in the movie he had been in real life also so he knew his part he was a fugitive throughout the movie someone else killed a man he character was blamed he is <UNK> by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him all sorts of minor plots ensue my favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one dead end kid couldn't swim and none of them could get out john's character saves the day the dead end kids were great as his friends and followers one of them right to the very end ann sheridan played the family's daughter and john's eventual love interest she was believable but not lovable in my opinion the only weak link in the movie
<START> let's see a couple dozen gary <UNK> gags as well as his <UNK> style a possibly <UNK> difficult <UNK> <UNK> of an <UNK> character a more than generous <UNK> of art direction from various pixar films positively lion king esquire villains living in what amounts to an <UNK> graveyard in the middle of farm country oh and a <UNK> joke ten years after any possible relevance the kids three and five liked it but boy it was a <UNK> for dad just another weak attempt from <UNK> films to <UNK> on to the animation explosion i really really wish they had spent a little more money on character design on rendering on a script on a director
<START> by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties the cardboard sets the moon kings with lightning <UNK> <UNK> onto their you know the <UNK> this one is a rocky jones adventure featuring the space <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> bitch queen of planet a <UNK> planet that won't join the united planets when the noble of <UNK> reason <UNK> that is on a <UNK> course with this other vaguely <UNK> planet bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than <UNK> her land this introduces a moral to the effect of the greatness of a nation is not in its land but its people which is <UNK> home five or six times in the climactic the constant <UNK> <UNK> about provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects is this a tv show
<START> a scientist has developed a serum which <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> hands and heads the scientist decides to use his serum on a concert <UNK> to <UNK> money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis j <UNK> <UNK> as dr <UNK> plays the monster maker in the low budget bela lugosi mode br br mr serum causes a real disorder which american <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> disease of adults marked by <UNK> of the bones of the <UNK> face and jaw that is caused by of the <UNK> ralph morgan as anthony lawrence plays the <UNK> man with some dignity pretty blonde <UNK> <UNK> as patricia pat lawrence is the daughter desired by mad scientist <UNK> in early scenes ms <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> hilariously br br watch for as <UNK> in a surprisingly good supporting performance she plays the somewhat garbo like and long suffering assistant to <UNK> ms definitely steals the film and you've got to question dr sanity in casting her aside glenn strange as steve and a crazed gorilla ray <UNK> add to the fun the monster makeup maurice is very good br br the monster maker 1944 sam j <UNK> <UNK> ralph morgan
<START> this program would be useful for training hardened <UNK> basic human emotions beyond this purpose the show has no value other than to fill <UNK> that would otherwise go in the <UNK> spectrum i feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a <UNK> voice chip endlessly <UNK> out the products of a random number <UNK> fortunately the helpful and frequent music <UNK> will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel in case they are unable to fully the predictable and shallow plot line i did find amy to be a <UNK> positive character as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in <UNK> male fields unfortunately her totally <UNK> approach to the law is guided solely by whatever <UNK> personal <UNK> amy <UNK> to employ resulting in <UNK> trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a <UNK> <UNK> than a true administration of justice this show is <UNK> in any amount although this is to some extent <UNK> after two episodes by the <UNK> god given <UNK> <UNK> by which the show will thankfully leave the same <UNK> on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume
<START> i love these awful 80's summer camp movies the best part about party camp is the fact that it literally has no plot it simply drops a weak <UNK> of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen the cliches here are <UNK> spoilers the <UNK> vs the <UNK> the secret camera in the girls locker room the <UNK> happening upon a <UNK> colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp <UNK> and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo <UNK> throughout the only cliche missing is the presence of corey <UNK> this movie will make you laugh but never intentionally i repeat never a final note be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the dramatic scene where jerry <UNK> and d a share a beer late at night <UNK> their guts to each other the dialogue literally makes no sense and the acting belongs on a high school stage it's a classic
<START> so this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea goes on and on with tension carey in a good <UNK> role but in a less than you expected performance weak direction from joel <UNK> match with some plot holes the detective scenes show us the luck of creativity if you don't have great expectations because of the negative reviews maybe you will enjoy this at the end they offer to us a lesson about morality for those who remember falling down and the family joy and cure that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable p s it's obvious who is the killer i wonder why w <UNK> carey didn't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film
<START> this <UNK> discovery channel documentary part biblical study part treasure hunt all might have sat well in it's television origins but falls flat as a feature film right from first glance of it's cheesy looking cover art one may cast doubts upon the integrity behind this serious subject shown on front case the search for <UNK> tomb to a generic action <UNK> that looks more national treasure or tomb <UNK> then any informed debate and examination of the historical burial site should such is the <UNK> way in which the entire proceedings <UNK> br br more curious child then worthy <UNK> <UNK> come across as self indulgent while his research comes across as manipulative for all the fascinating revelations this filmmaker tries to <UNK> on his viewers through supposed evidence a <UNK> of <UNK> statements <UNK> the same research and <UNK> over and over proves the lost tomb of jesus has very little information to back up the <UNK> albeit <UNK> claims what this amounts to is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience over the head with the same small factual evidence in support of this authenticity which ironically <UNK> from it while <UNK> <UNK> together many of these mini <UNK> found together to support the jesus of <UNK> theory this research a well rounded approach to continuously pursue this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> obsession there may be some impressive factual data which helps shed some light on many traditional <UNK> christian held beliefs but essentially the shady nature of this project made it come across as merely an exploitation piece <UNK> at a time when the da <UNK> code was all the rage br br in the end the cheesy cover art was right despite my appreciation for documentary form the lost tomb of jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into overlong and <UNK> adventure hunt <UNK> any relevance and <UNK> for the uninspired motivations behind this team by the time these tomb <UNK> have finished their <UNK> reluctantly having to stop research because of social demands viewers are left with the sense the director was <UNK> on <UNK> this mystery whether it was there to begin with or not there are a few genuinely potent moments where the <UNK> of history come <UNK> through this documentary in <UNK> ways but all the <UNK> exploring and <UNK> in the world still left this misguided vanity piece in an uneasy void of <UNK> response
<START> this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover my first impression sweet full moon <UNK> a scarecrow holding a <UNK> ok my impression i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago perfect a nice slasher film to start the evening with wrong absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out but thought i wasted 3 on this so ill finish it <UNK> the scarecrow well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots you see that every so often i was watching this thinking ok when are those <UNK> gonna run into this dude at one point i thought they died but no i mean their still alive i only <UNK> at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were one was the zoom in part at the start the director actor writer says remember i had that feeling well i have it again and it was either a zoom in or zoom out to hell i'm checking back but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look ok she believed him im sorry but yeah i didn't know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed not only that they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear br br the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the scream in the camera to make it scary ok filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins right i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie br br to top things off the <UNK> must have got lost or something cause seems the bad guy had just a stick not even an <UNK> someone should axe the <UNK> production film br br don't fall for the picture this movie is a piece of sh t i watched the trailer and guess what it has br br girls where are you talk to me and corn
<START> drawn by pain is easily one of the best pieces of cinema i have ever seen here are my reviews of the episodes released so far br br episode one was even better than i expected and from everything i had heard about it i expected quite a lot i am very impressed with the actors already the father was creepy and played perfectly the little girl is so <UNK> she uses her eyes to convey such emotion the animation was superb the cinematography was amazing each camera angle capturing the feeling of the scene perfectly the editing was done so well each scene <UNK> <UNK> into the next the music captured the emotions quite well and drew you into the story i just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was it definitely my <UNK> for more br br episode 2 was even better than the first one everything i said about the first episode carries through only you get to see even more of the character development i can not wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series for that matter what is developing is an intriguing character driven storyline with all the <UNK> of a big hollywood production but without the <UNK> so much is said with so few words this series is something like you've never seen and <UNK> to become a real success br br this episode was freaking awesome no other words describe it wow everything that i've said about the previous episodes holds true for this one and yet it was even better i don't know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better the further character development proves that this is a completely character driven piece the cinematography excels as it always has and draws you into <UNK> pain fear hate and emotional roller coaster i can't wait to see episode 4 or the rest of the series for that matter you have truly <UNK> yourself br br as much as i have loved the other episodes episode 4 is the best yet i love the character progression i feel like we are really coming to know emily her pain and her internal struggle the other themes i've stated in past reviews are continued great cinematography the writing is superb the actors are right on with their portrayals and have made the characters their own and the animation is simply amazing another great job from the crew
<START> i keep waiting for peter fonda to start acting for someone who comes from such a talented family it's a mystery to me why peter fonda can only play peter fonda trying to play someone else and that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the <UNK> a string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the <UNK> great play is what we're served the setting is the civil war and <UNK> here evil brother looks like an <UNK> melodrama villain complete with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i kept waiting for him to go uh ha <UNK> which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation none of the supporting cast was and peter <UNK> lack of expression and wooden body movements made the <UNK> story drag on and on br br the <UNK> is the <UNK> statement about the rage of man's <UNK> treatment of man the only believable character was the <UNK> man the counterpart the to the swamp had possibilities but the civil war setting just didn't make it all in all a very disappointing production i saw it on video and would advise if you want a willy shakespeare fix save your money on this one rent something else like branagh's much <UNK> about nothing or kevin kline in night dream
<START> i had actually considered <UNK> in this movie when was out <UNK> up funding i loved most of the script but did not like the ending insisted the ending was as it had to be br br seeing the completed movie i have to say i am amazed reading the script i had not imagined the acting and directing would be as powerful and moving as it is here the two leads did an amazing job they were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars br br now for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don't read further as you need to see the movie first i actually wish i had never read the script just so i could have experienced the movie ending first hand br br spoiler br br i have two main problems with the movie first off and i'm sure i mentioned this when i read the script the wife should have died if she were dead the ending would be much more believable as it is we have this guy who has been <UNK> over a woman who left him ago ' if she left him and he is still in love after so long he'd have to be seriously <UNK> but he doesn't come across that way in the script there is also the problem of why he did not <UNK> all this energy going after the wife he still loves br br plus if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling <UNK> love and therefore believe that the guy is <UNK> enough for the ending to be reasonable br br however i don't buy daphne doing what she does in the ending i'd need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl very naive for a whore but believable due to performance did what she did the character is simply not cold enough and if she did this out of some kind of love or something else then there is a whole piece of the movie story missing br br much of this movie is reminiscent of sex lies and video tape i think it could have been as popular if had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending br br so watch the movie enjoy the performance and make up your own mind
<START> eh <UNK> impossible <UNK> br br well paced highly entertaining film pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france and history are recommended i don't think this film really works in any other language the film is incredibly much better than the previous one in search of apart from great actors and <UNK> camera handling it's the wit and <UNK> of <UNK> word plays etc that make for a really great movie the cartoon is recognizable but the film is very <UNK> the cost of the film is put to good use indeed all the special effects fit into the movie you never feel <UNK> by them br br <UNK> les un <UNK> <UNK> part <UNK> br br a <UNK> from the other side of the <UNK>
<START> this is a great german slasher that's often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances all the characters are cool and <UNK> <UNK> is great as the psycho killer plus <UNK> <UNK> gives a fantastic performance as the main lead it did take a little while to get going but it was never boring and it had some good death scenes as well plus the music is wonderfully creepy i was lucky enough to get the subtitled version instead of the dubbed and i thought all the characters were quite likable plus it's very well made and written as well it has some really good plot twists too and the effects are extremely well done plus the ending is great the finale is especially suspenseful and <UNK> <UNK> was the perfect casting choice in my opinion plus i wish david didn't get killed of so soon because he was a really cool character there were actually a couple of moments where i felt uncomfortable but in a good way and i must say this film deserved all it's praise plus while it does have plot holes it's not enough to <UNK> the film this is a great german slasher that's often quite suspenseful and creative with a fun story and solid performances i highly recommend this one the direction is great <UNK> does a great job here with excellent camera work very good angles great close ups see the opening sex scene doing a great job of adding creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at a very fast pace br br there is quite a bit of blood and gore we get <UNK> cut open plenty of very gory surgery scenes lots of bloody <UNK> people are <UNK> while still being conscious severed finger self <UNK> bloody <UNK> throat lots of wicked looking frozen corpses plenty of blood and more br br the acting is very solid <UNK> <UNK> is fantastic as the main lead she was very likable remained cool under pressure was vulnerable easy on the eyes and we are able to care for her character the only time she seemed to suffer was when she had to <UNK> out some bad dialog here and there but that wasn't very often she was wonderful <UNK> <UNK> is excellent as the psycho killer he was simply chilling and wonderfully <UNK> he really gave me the creeps and was one effective killer anna <UNK> played her role very well as the smart slut i <UNK> her sebastian was great here as <UNK> he was quite likable and had a mysterious character his chemistry with <UNK> was also on and there was a great twists involving him at the end was good as the idiot phil and did his job well is good as <UNK> was great as david he had a really cool character and i wish he didn't get killed of so soon rest of the cast do fine br br overall i highly recommend this great german slasher 1 2 out of 5
<START> the <UNK> 1977 br br is a name very few are familiar with her bright career as a director only lasted a single decade ended abruptly by a tragic car accident despite her short career she however managed to create some of the best soviet films of her time her last film the <UNK> is widely regarded as one of the finest soviet films of the 1970s nevertheless her work remained in obscurity throughout the years that followed usually only available on rare and poor copies on video that has now changed thanks to the folks at <UNK> they've released two of best works through their <UNK> department wings and her <UNK> masterpiece the <UNK> br br set during the darkest days of wwii in snowy rural russia two <UNK> <UNK> their way across the land in search of food after their party is attacked by nazi <UNK> they're originally only to go to a nearby farm but when they arrive they find it <UNK> by the germans not wanting to return empty handed they continue on deeper into enemy territory along the way they must confront not only enemy soldiers but the harsh conditions of the russian <UNK> potential betrayal and their own souls br br the movie does not fall into simplistic plot devices or <UNK> it <UNK> difficult questions with painful <UNK> it never takes the easy road or gives us <UNK> answers the second half of the film is filled with moral <UNK> shows us the intimate horrors of war through the internal conflict between fellow russians those who <UNK> and those who fought back while she does show the <UNK> as the clear heels she nevertheless also shows why many turned to such tactics survival br br the film contains a number of religious references particularly to the lead up to the <UNK> this is a spiritual journey into the hearts souls and minds of the two <UNK> and those they encounter and her cinematographer capture the journey in beautiful black and white photography the camera moves in long shots similar to the camera work of another of <UNK> greatest filmmakers <UNK> <UNK> like many others was clearly influenced by <UNK> style and the <UNK> takes some of its <UNK> notes from childhood it is a stunning film to look at and does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied russia br br husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later <UNK> made his own war masterpiece with one of the greatest films i've ever seen come and see the story and themes of that film were clearly influenced by the <UNK> though that film is also a fairly obscure one it received far more attention that any of films that however acted as a bridge to and has been one of the best helps to keeping her work alive br br the <UNK> is a truly magnificent film and rightly should be considered one of the best films of the 70s it's stunning cinematography is inspiring its mood is <UNK> authentic and its lessons are unforgettable it is in any definition of the word nothing less than a masterpiece how unfortunate that career was cut short just as it was hitting its peak
<START> not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece this film contains a <UNK> of messages that all should take to heart especially women do not your man's dreams honor them that's why you loved him in the first place those who plan for death will live in the grave those who <UNK> will <UNK> those who live in fear even our lord spoke of this when he <UNK> the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and <UNK> the master take a risk get out of the boat and you will walk on water life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls
<START> well how to make a movie as provocative as possible this <UNK> straight shocker tries by having two low life paris women one prostitute one recently raped ex porn actress no less <UNK> out and go on a national sex and killing spree of men in particular br br very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore thelma louise but it's done completely without irony or <UNK> for any possible feminist message and since we don't get very close to the protagonists the violence actually feels muted and numbing and maybe that's a good thing br br as a liberal <UNK> of freedom of expression i always welcome when the serious movie industry <UNK> to contain full on sex scenes but the question is does it work for the movie as a whole is it any good here not very although we're given a new meaning to the phrase a shot in the ass br br 3 out of 10 from <UNK>
<START> i watched <UNK> and in operation <UNK> which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic like the comic the whole movie is full of jokes based upon <UNK> <UNK> jokes and slapstick gags which rarely fall flat br br <UNK> and are who use a strength <UNK> to fight the roman <UNK> in their native here they end up in egypt helping a friend build palace yes its <UNK> in three months to prove the <UNK> are just as good as the <UNK> br br the reason i picked this up was because monica is <UNK> she's good but the role is little more than a cameo however even though she's rarely in the film i didn't care since its so clever and the jokes so funny i was in <UNK> i loved it i loved it so much that i can't understand why the movies have never been released in the united states br br the <UNK> dvd has the film in english dub which is quite good especially when you consider that when you watch it in the longer french version the <UNK> and hence the jokes are not always apparent since they are <UNK> so if you read the names wrong the jokes are lost most of the jokes between the full french version and the shorter english dub seem to be exactly the same though some have been changed sometimes for the better and some times for the worse personally i'm gonna stick with the dub when i watch this again since its easier to pick up the jokes and enjoy the humor br br you really will want to see this if you love <UNK> and low brow but clever humor this is a great comedy
<START> this well meant film falls just a bit short and unfortunately in too many areas br br the scenery is gorgeous with <UNK> of north central <UNK> providing the setting for this mid century tale <UNK> bill <UNK> to go back to his <UNK> running past in order to save his farm br br going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight forward action this film rarely hits its <UNK> br br kris kristofferson as <UNK> bill seems pretty stilted or else it's his lines or else his cross of <UNK> and <UNK> accents anyway he just comes off as a low key blow hard his dialogs with gary <UNK> character do <UNK> though william rat is solid charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill but his <UNK> not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one luis <UNK> shows up on lake with a fine stand in performance by lake <UNK> as a monk with a hood accent who knows and then there's an <UNK> like her <UNK> she channels <UNK> as she <UNK> lines like you will marry a <UNK> woman just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough br br the end gets really choppy again a bad mix of magical realism and the <UNK> and <UNK> never provides an answer we can understand
<START> <UNK> in the navy <UNK> is painfully bad very likely the worst movie gary cooper ever made it's supposedly based on a true story but the incident which inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature length script br br i saw this movie on local television while i was house sitting for my mother in law in long island new york there was a raging <UNK> outside and i was literally <UNK> if i'd been able to get out the door i definitely would have stopped watching this movie br br there are some interesting names in the supporting cast notably charles bronson under his original name lee marvin harvey <UNK> jack <UNK> and jack warden forget it everybody stinks in this movie even the usually reliable <UNK> mitchell is awful lee marvin and jack warden are <UNK> so briefly there's no point in your watching for them br br gary cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship which is powered by a new experimental steam basically the whole ship is a giant cooper realises that the assignment is not a <UNK> one if it were it would have gone to a better officer br br cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles but he simply had no ability for comedy he made several bad comedies and this one is his worst jane <UNK> has always bored me and she bored me more than usual here this ship went down with all hands and <UNK> without a trace have i mentioned that this movie stinks i'll rate <UNK> in the navy <UNK> one point out of 10 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> okay here is a really short review this movie <UNK> i wish i could just have a review that stated this simple principle but i must bore you with more bad review type words like <UNK> and ' it's the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do here's the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play off hockey game and only van <UNK> can stop the madness truly truly terrible but then again i didn't pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of <UNK> in his <UNK> after this movie i hate the fact he is a <UNK> and all but then again he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage okay that is now enough space to be recognized as a review so i <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i wasted enough time actually watching this chore of a movie i don't want to waste more writing a big review not once did i so much as crack a smile all the jokes were boring forced and lacked any kind of wit i kept saying <UNK> the punchline almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clichéd and half the time there wasn't even any kind of solution things just happened to get to the next scene for the life of me i can't understand how this got as many good reviews as it did if you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making fat girls is the movie for you
<START> stay away from this movie it is terrible in every way bad acting a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in film history seldom do i watch a movie that makes my <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> in fact the only other movie that immediately springs to mind is another people in an aircraft in trouble movie <UNK> please please don't watch this one as it is utterly and totally pathetic from beginning to end <UNK>
<START> i missed the full four hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played one week i had to settle for seeing the shorter two and a half hour version a year or so later and was left stunned by what i saw i left the theater thinking i had witnessed a masterpiece and wondering what the full version was like br br the full version is mostly good but it has sequences that are so incredibly dull that the whole movie is pulled down and almost sinks beneath the waves br br the problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the final word on excess there are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens shots of people in a city that go on much too long with no purpose in the narrative we get beautiful <UNK> and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes but they are used too frequently as a place <UNK> instead of as <UNK> or to set a place much of the longer version seems to be on screen simply because it looked good br br i've attempted to actually sit down and watch heavens gate with out <UNK> to the fast forward button but somewhere along the way i find i can't stand it any more br br i wish mgm would take pity on us and release the shorter version to dvd as well as the huge dinosaur perhaps as a two pack so that we could see which is the better version and whether <UNK> was mad or not br br and while they were at it why not include the once <UNK> johnson county war edit that ran 90 minutes supposedly united artists <UNK> with a further cut in the hopes of getting some of their money back whether it was ever done or still exists is up in the air but it would be interesting to see
<START> fantastically written acted and produced loved seeing this <UNK> talented cast every single one of them give a such great performance this movie thoroughly <UNK> the <UNK> of my heart great storytelling br br this is a great movie for black history month full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who <UNK> incredible pain with dignity and a belief in a better future it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the <UNK> imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his <UNK> the next time you're in the company of a listening and <UNK> child remember show or he may be a writer in the making
<START> this movie was a <UNK> for me while i was surfing from channel to channel i don't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly i liked it this is a must see one br br
<START> this movie is such a waste of talented people and hollywood budget it made me think everyone in the movie was paying off a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible trash pile of a film it's a contrived plot that is just pathetic unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting the only thing that kept my interest was the numerous big names in the movie that kept popping up for no apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to the mess of a film i kept expecting it to have some good stuff since all of these people had been cool in other films but it never came through this film should be shown in prison as punishment but that would be cruel and unusual you will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces <UNK> around such a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and <UNK> bad acting this movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with lots of recognizable faces big trouble 2002 which also went off the <UNK> scale on the suck o <UNK>
<START> the word impossible has led many to <UNK> a particular view concerning any incredible task in <UNK> it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort nevertheless it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination such then is the heart of this movie called the spirit of st louis the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles <UNK> although there are many <UNK> of life the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic the story is an interesting one and for fans compelling to say the least seeking enough <UNK> to build a special aircraft to the <UNK> decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may <UNK> as he was <UNK> endured enormous risks which are featured in this superb film other <UNK> which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud <UNK> <UNK> robinson as ben <UNK> arthur space and charles <UNK> as o w <UNK> the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor <UNK> on its debut it has since become a classic in it's own right well done
<START> this movie was so awful i don't even know where to begin the only positive thing i can say about it is that luke perry gave a good performance the entire movie was all over the place there was no explanation as to the cause only theories of the <UNK> or for their <UNK> or why it would work it was ridiculous all the characters and relationship between them was so cheesy you just wanna laugh there was just no background to any of them the love relationship seemed to have been added on to the script it was so awkward there's an army man big black general with a permanent <UNK> in his mouth with the i'm the man attitude such a pathetic bad guy the two <UNK> who are supposed to be geniuses are acting like two 16 year old frat boys and then to create some action they decide to drop a rock on <UNK> shoulder and for the rest of the movie he's <UNK> as if he was dying of a <UNK> or something and then plays hero <UNK> scene of all to help the plan which is to do who knows what its never a good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud in the middle of the dramatic scene in a nutshell don't waste your time
<START> thankfully i watched this film alone <UNK> me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i don't find the movies <UNK> to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies br br if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear
<START> the true story of <UNK> who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they <UNK> out
<START> ideas are dangerous comment by one <UNK> br br dvd rating b 4 out of 5 8 out of 10 worth the time br br a great story for adults or teen <UNK> but not for children none of the stupid violent crime stuff so often mistaken by hollywood these days as quality work and it can be used as a <UNK> film on what proper <UNK> <UNK> is all about or not about prior to <UNK> the seven <UNK> the movie starts out somewhat slowly to develop the story as most documentaries do but as it draws the viewer into the saga emotions begin to in one's head emotions include anger sadness and disbelief the era late 1960's br br that solo <UNK> around the globe is dangerous is not surprising what is surprising is all the twists that viewers wouldn't expect its not your average group of guys in a <UNK> race each boat was different as allowed by the race rules each solo sailor had different levels of ability as allowed by the race rules there were well known sailors among them and a few not so well known one was considered a mystery man as nobody seemed to have any knowledge of his ability at all each boat was allowed to <UNK> at will so long as all were <UNK> by a certain date and this was of course prior to modern <UNK> that allow <UNK> to communicate with shore about vicious <UNK> etc br br actual video and audio <UNK> are interspersed with interviews of family members and others involved the mood of the <UNK> is always somber despite the years that have passed br br the main character don is the focus of attention how his journey relates to those who he not only wanted to beat but due to circumstances of his own creation had to beat he had to win the story was about what that <UNK> did to his life as he moved south west across the atlantic ocean over a years time alone on the water br br do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished the entire saga isn't fully understood w o viewing the <UNK> stuff br br in the end once you've watched everything on the dvd you will likely just shake your head and <UNK> <UNK> ' and keep in mind that is why the story has remained alive for the last 40 years br br spoiler do not fail to view the special features section of the dvd once the film is finished one sailor who was headed back to england after the globe decided on the fly that no he was going for another spin and the film records his <UNK> opinions about that decision the opposite story unfolds as another sailor wishes the race allowed two on board so he could take his wife along and their photos demonstrate a very warm union between them the interview with an ex <UNK> who had actually <UNK> a boat across the atlantic with a friend prior to the solo <UNK> race was incredibly funny as he described not even knowing how to <UNK> and who thought the bad things happening to him were <UNK> ' too many people think that setting <UNK> in the open sea can be an romantic adventure without <UNK> don't you be one
<START> i can accept the fact this was the next karate kid so ralph <UNK> can be happily retired from the series and while <UNK> <UNK> is great for the role the plot to the movie is just dreadful br br mr <UNK> old buddy from world war 2 dies leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand daughter when her parents die in an accident the girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local <UNK> which i'll explain in a minute has it out to get her you know the <UNK> <UNK> takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after br br its hokey its cheesy its the 90's but that's not even the long and the short of it my first case of huh is why is there a military division in high school i thought that stuff went out in the 1960's especially in a public school as much as michael <UNK> kicks <UNK> in his role as the main <UNK> since when is military involved in a high school my next <UNK> is that during the prom scene the <UNK> jump to scare the crap out of people why the thing i noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through billy in part 1 <UNK> in part 2 in part 3 this movie is no different after ned and <UNK> basically <UNK> the senior prom blow up <UNK> car and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the whole movie <UNK> tells them to beat her up and they're like um no if you're gonna do pathetic face turns at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod br br as for the rest of the love plot between eric and <UNK> <UNK> corny but nothing to melodramatic which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage ralph <UNK> pulled in the first 3 movies br br i will say for its own movie after watching the first 3 movies i can accept it being more or less a spin off but i can't accept the whole military thing way too <UNK> for it to be taken seriously now if <UNK> and crew was a wrestling football team and he was the coach that would have been more believable br br <UNK> and <UNK> deliver the goods <UNK> is ok the rest are the same as anything the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod that was cool 4 out of 10
<START> the first 20 minutes were a little fun because i don't think i've seen a film this bad before acting script effects etc the rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect these people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie there's no adult language a bit of brief nudity and no gore except fake blood <UNK> over no open wounds etc it would have been rated pg in the early eighties and pg 13 nowadays i'm not sure how it got an r rating or if it really did i saw the american international release titled hospital of terror i've seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film i've ever seen here's an example of how bad it is there's one scene where something green comes through the door i'm not sure what it's supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kid's green <UNK> <UNK> i'm not <UNK> super <UNK> over the film semi moving inside the door then its supposed to do something to nurse <UNK> to possess her i suppose i could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment
<START> i was really surprised when i came across this movie on cable tv a couple of years ago the story is a wonderful example of how our land keeps changing and the fight to hang on to it and use it according to need <UNK> desires of the people and the government the actors were fantastic in their portrayals and i absolutely fell in love with <UNK> she is so believable and was such a character in this movie as was rip torn the story was also a love story about the land the past and between the 2 main characters i have tried to buy this film and have been unable to locate it but i would sure would love to own it
<START> if you want to see real evidence of what a misguided and <UNK> government can do to un popular people this movie provides it read what some people are saying about the <UNK> act passed after 9 11 and then watch this movie is it worth it do we really want to give away our <UNK> to these people regardless of what you saw on tv you are not fully informed until you watch this movie i apologize for <UNK> another reviewer but it needs repeating roger ebert of <UNK> ebert said what's interesting is if you're looking for people who are <UNK> <UNK> you don't find them among the branch <UNK> you find them among the fbi and the alcohol <UNK> and <UNK> those are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared i think i think every person responsible for 9 11 needs to be brought to justice but i think the government has not shown a history of <UNK> it's duty to protect people's rights and this movie proves it in dramatic fashion
<START> i'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in a 5 bin i figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection while i never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing br br the premise has enough potential a penguin named finds the perfect <UNK> to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea he then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home that set up isn't great but it's enough to set up what could be a fun adventure unfortunately the <UNK> exploits never really amount to much and it all gets pretty repetitive most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity and the bonding the two of them under go is cheesy and forced br br animation is good but not up to don <UNK> usual standards this is the guy that gave us the secret of <UNK> land before time and an american tale all of which had an attention to detail that often <UNK> disney the <UNK> of feature animation this one doesn't amount to much beyond high end tv fair br br the music is alright but pretty forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talent martin short is particularly wasted here as the lead character who in spite of being spoken of as a is practically a straight man through the whole film br br in short the movie will probably appeal to very small kids but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it doesn't got what it takes
<START> most people get the luxury of <UNK> in the title of a film and finding out about the film before watching it but unfortunately i've just never been one of those kind of people i wouldn't even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers but there are two sides to that because if you ignore such <UNK> and even give a film a chance after it has <UNK> in theatres you're entering at your own risk and might just end up with a bad taste in your mouth which is exactly how i feel about this stupid movie br br honestly the only thing good about crap crap are some of it songs and seriously <UNK> the title track even the ever promising talent <UNK> gangster is seriously wasted here as she plays the woman who has captured the attention of both the leading male characters played by bobby <UNK> who plays a j a <UNK> music producer and <UNK> who plays an upcoming artist who crosses a j 's path <UNK> <UNK> provides the right amount of <UNK> required of a <UNK> who gets <UNK> by whom she helped get his foot in the record <UNK> door this doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should include <UNK> <UNK> right well you're wrong because he's in it as father another wasted talent br br the film might not have been so bad had their not over killed the writing behind <UNK> character the moral message was too preachy revenge had a deadly dark side and the ending was way too overblown that it will make you wonder why you sat down to such a foolish movie in the first place truly this is the epitome of crap
<START> naturally in a film who's main themes are of <UNK> nostalgia and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones however there is a <UNK> and <UNK> to the film which anyone can enjoy the pace is steady and constant the characters full and engaging the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need <UNK> of tears to show emotion screams to show fear shouting to show <UNK> or violence to show anger naturally <UNK> short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly it is truly a masterpiece of <UNK> subtlety and overwhelming beauty
<START> for some reason i always enjoy movies that people hate when i really don't think they're that bad and this is one of those films in the case of this movie i think it is way too over criticized i really isn't that bad of a film at all in fact i think this is one of the better sequels halloween the curse of michael myers begins on the night before halloween where michael brutally murders jamie lloyd who was taken captive by the man in black in part 5 after she gives birth to his baby we are then introduced to the <UNK> family who is now <UNK> living in the old myers house which seems to change in each film <UNK> and her son danny are the main characters along with tommy doyle the now adult boy who survived the original killings they must fight together to save <UNK> baby from an evil cult that takes care of michael while michael himself is driven to kill by an old <UNK> ritual where he must sacrifice an entire family in <UNK> br br this is surely one of the best sequels in the series in my opinion anyway and i can't understand all of the hate it has gotten it had some nice suspense an interesting plot but sometimes confusing i'll admit some scary moments here and there and plenty of gore and knife <UNK> to <UNK> all of you <UNK> not all of the acting wasn't particularly great but it was convincing enough for me <UNK> <UNK> is the leading lady and she is very likable paul rudd plays a grown up tommy doyle and is also very talented and plays his part nicely the rest of the supporting cast besides the brilliant donald <UNK> isn't much to praise but it wasn't too bad either all things considered i'm still not sure if giving an explanation for why michael kills was completely necessary but it turned out to be okay in the end and i wasn't upset with the way they tied everything together the open ended conclusion was also kind of eerie but could have been something more br br i have also seen the infamous <UNK> cut of this film the original cut of it and i think that in some respects it is better it further explains the thorn curse that drives michael and has some extra scenes that really helped support the film plus the ending was a lot better in my opinion it felt more natural than the conclusion that we're given in the studio cut of the film i wish that dimension would release this alternate version of the film because i personally think it is better the chances of that are very slim though br br overall halloween the curse of michael myers is a very good sequel and will please all of the fans of the series this movie isn't the best of all horror movies but it's definitely worth renting if you want to see michael do his thing just don't expect brilliance and you'll enjoy it 7 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years not only in the usa but especially in this country one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair for example in american etc it was an original story with a touch of <UNK> sadness in it the characters in the film were like lonely cells in a body that was changing all over overall a very good film perhaps a little underrated though annie role was minor but she acted very well it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor one of the members of the chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role
<START> no no no no no no no this is not a film this is an excuse to show people dancing this is just not good even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre <UNK> <UNK> let alone any other good dance movie br br is it a love story is it a musical is it a drama is it a comedy it's not that this movie is a bit of all it's that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be the film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progresses br br acting is terrible from all sides the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserably br br watch for the moment when patrick stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he <UNK> up the dull atmosphere for a second
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> film death in <UNK> it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that <UNK> but in the pursuit of beauty itself <UNK> von <UNK> into a mere shell of a man to understand the <UNK> we must acknowledge the beauty which <UNK> us it is best described and explained in a quote from <UNK> found in thomas <UNK> version of death in <UNK> beauty alone is lovely and visible at it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our else the divine if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses should we not <UNK> and become consumed by love we see in the film this very thing happen the man becomes <UNK> by a longing for beauty which turns into a longing for the boy even though the <UNK> part of his mind tells him that <UNK> of beauty can lead to <UNK> and abandon he cannot contain himself br br it would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film early on we see the <UNK> of the <UNK> and we are treated to a perfect <UNK> of turn of the century upper class life all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer <UNK> de <UNK> but visconti does not <UNK> in the <UNK> aspects of <UNK> instead the glorious and <UNK> artistic achievements of the past are based on <UNK> and <UNK> beauty and these things are <UNK> to the past the city we know to be of <UNK> beauty and <UNK> is nothing more than a <UNK> resort with a <UNK> hotel staff the streets become <UNK> <UNK> filled with disgusting filth and <UNK> the city <UNK> in step with the protagonist only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a <UNK> and <UNK> man the death of his daughter and presumably his wife along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself br br alfred with whom has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it but alfred is more than a friend he is alter ego and what alfred says the <UNK> own doubts and fears the scene in which decides to leave <UNK> is immediately followed by a clip of alfred telling him that he is weak <UNK> and lacks feelings in the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all it is a <UNK> of memory rather than objective <UNK> of the past these flashbacks become distorted memories we can say that these are <UNK> memories because even <UNK> to it he declares reality <UNK> and <UNK> us and following the scene in the travel <UNK> office we see confront and his family and warn them leave <UNK> but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of <UNK> he allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch life and <UNK> <UNK> with the beauty around him br br slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by <UNK> that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is <UNK> in filth the <UNK> city sets the stage for the middle aged man's attraction to it is romantic longing for something so <UNK> and ambiguous that it can never be consumed even in fantasy the beauty of this polish boy a fire in him that at first makes him glow then <UNK> him the film concludes with von sitting <UNK> in a beach chair watching fight with his friend we see the black <UNK> from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood it is a vision of his life's moments though before his last breath the final <UNK> has happened all around him the city is <UNK> and with it he has become what he <UNK> as dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film a man that had disturbed him it was the pursuit of beauty that <UNK> his <UNK> in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise and that of the city around him his <UNK> is <UNK> in while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and <UNK> it is these three themes that tie the damned and death in <UNK> together beauty death and <UNK> these themes are <UNK> art the beauty of his work is in the <UNK> of beauty itself br br in this film we are treated to the of one great man we see the <UNK> composer <UNK> von in the pursuit of true and pure beauty and it is in the pursuit of this <UNK> that it <UNK> all around him and leads him to a miserable lonely death watching the target of his affection i believe that through these movies visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last <UNK> is <UNK> in the world around us and when we become distracted it can destroy the <UNK> in death in <UNK> it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted beauty and are woven together like <UNK> in <UNK> works at once beautiful and destructive it is these themes that define his art
<START> i've seen this movie quite a few times and each time i watch it the <UNK> and funnier it becomes perhaps its the lack of research that went into nicolas <UNK> character's persona or just the cheesiness factor because it was such a typical eighties film nonetheless it's a cute love story with extremely funny unique characters i think it's right up there with fast times and weird science quintessential eighties flicks
<START> two things too long and totally lacked credibility this movie didn't make any sense and was to sit through i am usually pretty patient but man it just doesn't keep your attention at all i think i am being nice here even you keep thinking it's almost over only to find out it's still got another half hour good actors
<START> who gave these people money to make a movie there was nothing funny about it the fact that the <UNK> dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all first of all it has nothing to do with christmas it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original they took randy 'i have no talent i m just a fat and <UNK> quaid the only wrong thing about part 1 and made a <UNK> about him there are only morons in his family but not the <UNK> they <UNK> kinda moronic but the <UNK> t touch <UNK> kinda moronic watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies they didn't even bother to get the effects in order when they re on the boat the only thing that moves is the fake background when <UNK> quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it's in a studio this movie was sexist uncle nick racist uncle nick and should never have been made never throwing the money into a <UNK> would have had so much more use br br well i hope i reached some of you nobody warned me and now i m <UNK> for life merry f <UNK> christmas
<START> within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene i was watching i just could help but the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing well actually the soundtrack shows that the best i no its a low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn't actually that hard acting well if i saw any i would gladly let you know the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of <UNK> i will give the person one 10 10 and that was for the dvd cover because if i actually saw before watching this in a shop and it was like 10 15 bucks i would have bought it why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards now that is a very misleading thing because even in a small film festival i wouldn't ever believe in my life that this would win anything all i can say is wow if this was the best i wouldn't want to know what the crap in the film festival was like br br films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for a aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films because with good film you almost know off the bat there is a good chance you wont make a film that good but if you use a film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if a piece of <UNK> like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there
<START> i watched this with great <UNK> and my <UNK> was well <UNK> it seems what was this movie about knight the season the players what it was all over the place all the time it had no tension sorry we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things but brian a fine actor comes across as <UNK> in the anger and delivering zero tension cheaply shot like a episode contrast this <UNK> main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie only in america to show how to do sports <UNK> <UNK> and all notice that <UNK> promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again
<START> in spain the former sailor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has been for twenty eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing <UNK> through an association that <UNK> the freedom of choice and <UNK> by his friend clara <UNK> is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause julia <UNK> who has a <UNK> fatal disease and meets <UNK> lola a lonely worker that has been abused by men their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of <UNK> and julia br br the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is in my opinion one of the best contemporary directors his filmography released in brazil is composed by excellent and original movies <UNK> los <UNK> <UNK> the others and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is probably the best actor in spain in the present days their association produced this sensitive drama about a very <UNK> theme the right of committing <UNK> this drama is never corny or <UNK> since the screenplay uses humor as a <UNK> <UNK> in the most dramatic situations the performances of the cast are perfect with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme the dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent i noted in imdb plot outline that this movie is based on the real life story of <UNK> unfortunately neither the movie nor the dvd gives this important information my vote is nine br br title brazil <UNK> sea inside
<START> this movie moved me more than i was expecting and i was fully prepared to cry the acting mainly carried this film with superb performances from jude law nicole kidman and <UNK> <UNK> as well as the supporting cast these actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they <UNK> the remainder of the night with me and i had trouble shaking this war drama the costumes and cinematography were also magical but didn't get carried away with themselves they didn't take focus but added to the whole effect cold mountain could never become my favorite movie as that title will always belong to the english patient but it's in the top five the story itself was well developed and stayed fairly unpredictable i did not find myself guessing what line came next a heart wrenching story about humanity and war in fact this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century it seemed to apply to all times
<START> ok i gave it a 3 just because they obviously had no money to make this film but i feel it might deserve the 2 3 rating it had when i got here i'm actually helping to raise it's rating despite being bored for the last hour and a half i will save the <UNK> and the <UNK> for the higher budget pieces of crap at least the makers of rise of the undead didn't waste that much money they did manage to waste 90 minutes of my life br br the movie is too claustrophobic for me the entire movie takes place in the same building in dark rooms and <UNK> with a setting like this there should have been more action or character development but there is just a lot of meaningless talk i didn't get to know any of the characters there is a <UNK> and a <UNK> chick but we never find out much more about them none of the characters seem really likable br br terrible movie made on zero budget no scary special effects no suspense really nothing interesting at all here folks i admit i <UNK> this from the net it was free but i am throwing it away br br sorry to the filmmakers better luck next time this one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie
<START> spoilers when i first saw the preview for this it looked like a good old fashioned hallmark movie i love <UNK> music so i couldn't wait to see it when we rented the movie we read the back and it sounded even better the film was pretty boring for the first half every now and then a song would be played then i'm embarrassed <UNK> this a lesbian love seen came in i that <UNK> was something more then friendship between the teachers but i certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make out sessions i was watching this with my mother and i was quite embarrassed because i picked this movie but besides that it was an okay movie the acting was fine the actress who played was great to be honest the soundtrack was the best part of the movie i don't care to see the movie again but i bought the soundtrack the day after i saw the movie and there are <UNK> <UNK> that follow if i were you i would skip the movie and just get the music
<START> my mistake for thinking this was a serious war is hell movie prior to seeing it that all ended seconds into the film when the mtv <UNK> appeared it might as well been called national <UNK> sexy n loose and it did play to the mtv crowd the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40 years ago at least disney was smart enough to ship its rated r stuff over to and allowed us to take it seriously okay i'm being harsh it wasn't that bad of a film however it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased one sided admittedly i'm not a war movie buff i can't watch ' <UNK> metal <UNK> or <UNK> private <UNK> more than once sure they were good movies but they're not my <UNK> and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where i wouldn't be able to <UNK> one from the next following a tour in iraq <UNK> plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a <UNK> in his contract or at least that's the <UNK> plan until he goes <UNK> and the characters speed cross country on a few bucks amazingly never caught no i haven't been in any war nor to iraq nor do i agree with it i also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to <UNK> or <UNK> their <UNK> i can say this though i am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict i can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print it's like someone on their <UNK> <UNK> over to finally read the surgeon <UNK> warning on their box of <UNK> and say oh they're what deadly i'll sue them
<START> i will <UNK> admit that i haven't seen the original movie but i've read the play so i've some background with the original if you off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic this movie is smart witty fresh and hilarious yes the casting decisions may seem strange but they work br br i'm a <UNK> feminist and i wasn't offended in the slightest by this movie despite what other women might be saying this is not a movie for men to see so please ladies don't drag your guys to see it with you that's just cruel women will get the jokes the situations and the relationships br br i was pleasantly surprised by the depth that <UNK> <UNK> brought to her character she did an excellent job debra messing was adorable and <UNK> <UNK> was fantastic i was less impressed by meg ryan she brought emotion to the table but her comedic take on it was less strong the all female cast is strong and it definitely a laugh out loud sort of comedy i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and fully intend to go see it again with my mother women will understand
<START> going to need to take a deep breath for this one br br terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget blatant and <UNK> <UNK> of other sci fi movies like pitch black terrible acting endless slow motion scenes of characters walking <UNK> across sand <UNK> meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story characters wearing turtle neck <UNK> on a desert planet with two <UNK> a <UNK> ship <UNK> by a <UNK> wearing crew of gun <UNK> soldiers why exactly would you need forest <UNK> in space anyway some of the worst casting choices in the history of no budget film making a <UNK> <UNK> captain who comes across more like a muscle beach jock than a <UNK> commander and a convict who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit 70 minutes in length 35 of which could have been <UNK> out if the director had any concept of <UNK> of time through editing br br i won't go on suffice it to say that while some <UNK> of this awful movie can and should be forgiven due to it's low budget the bad conception laughable plot holes and <UNK> inducing script are unforgivable on any budget the end result is a tedious dull waste of time sorry guys i hate to be so harsh on an amateur film but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work
<START> after watching the movie a few times i found so many subtle touches and emotions within the dialogue <UNK> <UNK> the assassin has become one of favorite movie characters of all time this fine chinese actor says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements then any big screen american actor today the emperor is brilliant as he leads the audience to believe the kindness in his heart only to <UNK> the most cruel acts upon the people around him the promises he makes with incredible passion and <UNK> with an evil fist <UNK> li as in just about every movie i've ever seen her in is simply fantastic her screen <UNK> is so <UNK> and emotionally charged br br in case you couldn't tell i loved this movie br br
<START> david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary 8 episode trip to all the animals under the sea br br the cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those <UNK> but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the <UNK> they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it br br 2001 had some great tv shows to our screen but in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame but to even <UNK> this documentary series as the best tv series of 2001 just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment br br overall this is the best tv series of 2001 with no competition and maybe the best tv series of <UNK>
<START> i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves just view those votes not top class action like die hard or lethal weapon but still something like a solid 7 out of 10 fine script good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants sadly this was director <UNK> last good film deep blue sea managed to reach <UNK> ok <UNK> status but <UNK> island and especially driven are well deserved <UNK> personally i think the turn off at the box office might have been the woman as an action star theme well give her a chance because davis does deliver a performance above par and after all this film doesn't concentrate so much on the feminine side but instead on good ol' action jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here plus his share of action and about a thousand killer <UNK> and on the plot from <UNK> black the writer of lethal weapon and the last boy <UNK> the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one the theme the clever plot also as good and as underrated overall if one hasn't seen this one yet don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night
<START> i am an addict of the tv show the live shows and everything they do and this was the last piece of work they have done on tv film as 'the league of <UNK> br br if you love the series then you will absolutely love the film it is a nice ending to their tv series br br it is clever and funny br br although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers a must see for any league of gentlemen fan br br watch it
<START> this appears to be one of <UNK> <UNK> lesser known films and it is easy to understand why taken at face value it's not a bad film but there's nothing terribly good about it either nothing much happens at all throughout the course of the film it's simply the story of chris and <UNK> ill <UNK> affair and <UNK> reaction to it the only thing that keeps the film interesting is the fact that we already know it's going to end badly for one reason or another <UNK> to the first scene oddly there are many perfect opportunities in the story for conflict and yet none of them are <UNK> for example it would've been much more interesting and believable if barbara fallen out with <UNK> but instead the two remained on good terms throughout the film the notion of barbara having been betrayed by her friend was not explored at all in fact she didn't even seem to feel betrayed by her husband she even encourages him to go on a holiday with <UNK> similarly <UNK> two <UNK> at his practice susan <UNK> and tim who also happen to be close friends of both chris and barbara are never forced to take sides in fact tim <UNK> away from conflict by telling chris that he's terribly fond of both him and barbara despite the strange lack of conflict the biggest flaw in the film is the fact that we don't care whether chris ends up with <UNK> or barbara the two <UNK> personalities are <UNK> anyway so we don't know which of the two is better suited to be with chris and besides this <UNK> gives the impression that she hardly cares about the affair anyway furthermore i found chris and <UNK> relationship somewhat unconvincing i can overlook the ridiculously short <UNK> in which they fall for each other because that is so common in films of this era but even then the relationship seemed shallow <UNK> character was too <UNK> and cynical to be the object of <UNK> affections he reminds me of the socially inept genius sir earnest from the film very important person i'm sure the two would've gotten along well <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> made his love for <UNK> seem <UNK> i think coward should've sat this one out and given his part to a younger man as it is i was constantly wondering what this young beauty saw in such a <UNK> mostly <UNK> <UNK> middle aged man despite all my criticisms the film still manages to be interesting just not terribly compelling the fact that none of the characters are particularly well developed gives them an enigmatic nature which is somewhat intriguing the <UNK> heart is certainly worth watching but it is a flawed piece of cinema
<START> how did this film get into the berlin film festival i understand it got into the <UNK> section but still br br this film featured br br 1 no plot 2 horrible acting 3 atrocious 4 some of the worst <UNK> ever captured on video br br the one <UNK> that accounts for most of its festival is the presence of that old <UNK> homosexuality that's right about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one <UNK> artist makes out with another one and <UNK> him off then he feels weird about it and they have a boring old breaking up conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in middle school featuring lines like you <UNK> me first dude oh and by the way this is no crying game you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the film aside from that it's mostly just bad <UNK> badly <UNK> undercover cops some <UNK> and a train ride br br if the subject matter is of interest to anyone i recommend looking around the web for some underground <UNK> videos taken by real <UNK> artists there's plenty out there and they are a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap
<START> i like underground films when they have something to say or show for that matter i tried hard to like trash i tried to see some artistic achievement or some interesting representation of new york city life in the early 70's or at least being entertained by it but the movie stinks and can't be called either art or entertainment br br trash is basically an excuse to expose joe nude body for 2 hours while he meets other uninteresting annoying figures i agree that's a gorgeous body but no excuse for a whole movie about it right holly as <UNK> girlfriend provides a few good laughs by the end but then it's too late to save those wasted couple of hours lou <UNK> classic song walk on the wild side is a better portrayal of those people and that time even if it's more fascinating than they actually were 1 5 10
<START> this is one of the worst films i've seen for years the storyline has potential that is never realized the actors are a poor choice but considering the screen writing their talent isn't wasted i really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so i could get out and watch something else unfortunately i did stay to the end and had a laugh at the <UNK> of people <UNK> about how crappy this is there wasn't <UNK> after all this is england just gentle <UNK> about how crap that was then i look on imdb and see people have given it 10 out of 10 i really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score they must be a <UNK> company working with the <UNK> there's a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film when in the graveyard and the <UNK> attacks look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched supposed to be a brick wall the blood effects are <UNK> <UNK> the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the director
<START> we went to the cinema expecting a budget release and got an art house movie the movie was projected <UNK> onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with edges classic of digital projection and had a limited <UNK> soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience br br the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before but heavily <UNK> to prevent the audience being sick live action scenes what little of them there were were re used constantly in classic documentary style which became annoying after a while br br i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it guess the rest knew something we didn't br br i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the <UNK> of <UNK> i have to question whether they should have bothered br br seven out of ten for trying and out of respect for the
<START> i guess if you like watching <UNK> get <UNK> up to outrageous <UNK> this is right up your alley otherwise it's an exercise in ego i don't need to do either <UNK> it's of historic interest i guess to see how these muscle positive and brain negative <UNK> got that way before after and in between <UNK> but otherwise this isn't going to influence many guys and as for women well i'm not one so i can't say
<START> i enjoy the national <UNK> i enjoy the national <UNK> if for nothing else then just before the midnight news i imagine i'm playing the in the band not as easy as you may think one two three four one two three four but then what so i have sympathy with the <UNK> bass drum player in roy wonderful film <UNK> waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s <UNK> player br br the 70s <UNK> seems to continue throughout with some classic soulless furniture moreover every scene has an eerie <UNK> wash which <UNK> the minute nuances of the of acting br br which brings me to outstanding purple boots boots which otherwise would have inspired a <UNK> cult advertising campaign br br but then the difficult bit someone asked me what it was about well there is a scene where the opening line as i don't have that length in green brilliant straight out of a gary <UNK> <UNK> br br i can't say what it's about go see yourself br br ron <UNK> br br hmm <UNK> sounds swedish br br viewed
<START> i had my son for the weekend and my <UNK> called me up and said that they wanted the two of us to meet them at the movies when i got there my mom said that she really wanted to see the women and asked if my son and i minded due to it being labeled as a chick flick i reluctantly agreed thinking this was going to be another first wives club type movie i gotta say that i was very surprised to find myself really enjoying the movie from the opening scene to the credits it was a great production and the cast was perfect in their roles my son and i found ourselves laughing through entire movie and we are glad that we saw it it made for a great saturday afternoon movie and i highly recommend it to anyone man or woman
<START> the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro br br in order to enjoy some movies a lot can be forgiven hand guns with 60 shots hero's with super human powers all women are gorgeous and half naked but this assault on my intelligence 13 is so far fetched that i'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming br br firstly how did these guys get to be cops based on stupidity i guess how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are as a matter of fact no character <UNK> to the elements whatsoever in this movie no windows no electricity which miraculously returns unexplained during the storm of the century and they are all <UNK> as bugs in a <UNK> what technology exists which all cell phones <UNK> and brain function this must be the same power which causes maria <UNK> to walk from her disabled car <UNK> deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress
<START> rather than go on location and make a realistic film about drug addiction in the <UNK> city director otto preminger decided to go the opposite way and make his movie appear as artificial as possible thus flying in the face of the fashion set by men like kazan huston and <UNK> who were making their pictures all over the world nelson on whose novel the movie is based went on record as <UNK> it what one wonders was preminger up to and why did he do the movie this way br br the sets in the film are so minimal as to suggest a mr <UNK> cartoon <UNK> the drug <UNK> is <UNK> as to resemble the sort of gangster the artists at mad magazine used to draw arnold wonderful comedian that he was seems out of place in a serious picture like this and his very appearance topped off by an exaggerated and over sized baseball cap <UNK> laughter robert <UNK> another actor best known for humorous roles is likewise out of place as his large heavily face and <UNK> delivery of lines seems more appropriate to a jerry lewis movie against all this stars frank sinatra kim novak and <UNK> parker have to work <UNK> to just keep the viewer from <UNK> sinatra is <UNK> and manic throughout suggesting a man ill at ease with himself hence wholly appropriate for the role of a drug addict miss novak plant like and <UNK> deadpan is sympathetic and seems a product of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> in the film parker is pure hollywood and very hard working as the crippled and <UNK> she is never convincing but then neither is the film br br i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug <UNK> in america the <UNK> sets alone make it unbelievable preminger may have been aiming for a dream effect as the cardboard backgrounds give the proceedings the surreal feeling of a nightmare <UNK> perhaps <UNK> back to <UNK> early days in vienna
<START> such a highly anticipated remake of a <UNK> musical classic and such a bitter <UNK> it was to have to take very very hard to swallow all of it it didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere and when you don't have a rose you don't have a show br br bette midler seemed born to play this part yet all she was able to produce was a cute funny <UNK> trademark bette midler <UNK> down with all the familiar <UNK> russell has nothing to worry about she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose of film anyway br br i thought midler was really going to put it across this time to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time like she did in the rose but no she played it safe she played herself she made rose a total dinner theatre cartoon even her songs were uninspired it was <UNK> to watch knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money making <UNK> she showed promise only once in this gypsy and that was with <UNK> turn but by then it was too little too late br br a sincere <UNK> as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy <UNK> that of rose you know there's trouble in river city br br a huge huge letdown
<START> it's true no one really expects anything from sequels but even by that low standard this is a terrible film br br essentially an anthology movie this fourth installment in the <UNK> saga tries to be an origins story and a wind up to the entire series at the same time an ambitious idea but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director abandoned the film rather than give in to studio <UNK> the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even <UNK> have trouble defending unless you're an alan <UNK> fan avoid this one
<START> though stephen <UNK> is a good tv director with a few good full length to his credit <UNK> is just a mess in its script and direction despite performances from billy bob john <UNK> kelly lynch jon bon <UNK> jamie lee curtis and ted <UNK> a cast this good couldn't save the film br br will know that jake and maggie are in the film but you don't see jake very well and <UNK> only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter <UNK> off <UNK> character about a bust it's not even a <UNK> pot comedy as the film was intended to be it just wasn't funny
<START> did <UNK> and <UNK> make this movie it is just that bad truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs good in the wine world did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the from the featured <UNK> of individual and the camera work is <UNK> at best while the content may put you to sleep before long this is not insightful <UNK> what i got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the of wine by showing for example that the family owned in all parts of the world okay that is a good start so how do these compare does the <UNK> cab taste like their italian we never find out because no one in the film comments on this instead there is a lot of innuendo about <UNK> and <UNK> well those things don't grow <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it's the one film i almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me normally even if i don't like a film i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end that way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself but with the million dollar hotel it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible i think i probably would not have been so <UNK> disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one i didn't normally like so much but coming from <UNK> it was all the more shocking to behold i know <UNK> from <UNK> a good friend of <UNK> wrote the script to this abysmal film and i wonder why <UNK> let him as buddy buddy as the two may have been stick to the day job <UNK> is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess pretentious disjointed a <UNK> mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as <UNK> and daring with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon especially the leads jeremy davies <UNK> <UNK> and mel gibson none of whom i dislike normally the <UNK> ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible on a positive note the first five minutes of the film are extremely good with an extremely stirring soundtrack from <UNK> but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film which takes a spectacular nose dive from then on all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered not even close
<START> it is hard to screw up this story great book good film version from fred yet this film is awful first the casting was terrible richard gere should of played the himself as edward fox was a similar type of cypher and they didn't need to mess with the original script by adding so much worthless expensive fluff this film reminded me of so many bruce willis films as you see huge expense with nothing cinematic to show for it it is his conspiracy theory it takes some real doing to make a film this bad from such a fine original script every person from michael <UNK> jones down should be banned from making films for 10 years such is the insult this film is to real filmmakers were hollywood to go on trial for having no idea what they were doing this film would be exhibit a shame on you all
<START> husband and wife doctor team carole and <UNK> nelson are doing <UNK> well in their careers but <UNK> has a gambling problem his luck changes when he <UNK> saves the life of a gangster from joe mob and gets a big bonus from the himself loving his change of fortune and <UNK> new apartment <UNK> continues to receive <UNK> for <UNK> up other injured members of the gang unfortunately his shady deals come to light in a police raid which hangs a shadow over his wife's career as well br br at this point the plot comes into focus as carole nelson has to rescue her career before her license is suspended this involves bringing the gang to justice more or less single <UNK> br br this is not a hard edged gangster picture but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like <UNK> or murder she wrote there is some tension but the mood is kept light by <UNK> tongue in cheek performance of a stupid gangster who <UNK> himself as the <UNK> of crime his other gang members also function more as stooges than <UNK> and there's some snappy dialog between bogart and francis especially when she's treating his <UNK> at his <UNK> of course as in all gangster flicks there's a big shootout ending but with a humorous twist this is a good short film showing bogart on his rise to stardom
<START> <UNK> is a terrific movie well acted and directed and rather down to earth in it's approach to the various bizarre aspects of <UNK> and it's politics this is together with <UNK> boot one of the best war movies together with the <UNK> the winter war in english i believe it depicts the <UNK> of some of the german soldiers that fought and died in and around <UNK> during world war 2 no big time <UNK> no over bearing emotional <UNK> only the fear of every day death in war the mood of the movie is similar to the one in <UNK> boot and that should give you some hints on what to expect i guess so if you enjoy realistic non <UNK> war movies rent it buy it just make sure you see it finally a film <UNK> note for some of the previous reviewers information i only want to add that <UNK> isn't directed by <UNK> <UNK> who made <UNK> boot
<START> mary haines meg ryan a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman eva <UNK> she doesn't know what to do and friends sylvia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> edie cohen debra messing and alex fisher <UNK> smith try to help br br ok there was no reason to <UNK> the 1939 movie that's a true classic and doesn't need to be updated and <UNK> naturally it was done this has gotten some of the worst reviews i've ever seen for a motion picture i love the original and have seen it many times i was constantly comparing it to that now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad br br minor spoilers first the bad the story is old and was badly updated really a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today meg ryan a wonderful actress is pretty terrible here her face seems unable to change expression i couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes came over eva <UNK> is bad too but it's not entirely her fault her role is badly written and she has to compete with joan crawford from the original smith's character a tough lesbian goes to pieces in an operating room it is funny but it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an <UNK> also the script <UNK> some clumsy <UNK> where ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself in those moments it seems more like a lifetime movie than anything else br br now the good this movie <UNK> the decision to never show a man on screen this movie is about and for women men aren't needed btw i'm a man <UNK> is just great as <UNK> whenever she's on screen the movie makes a great leap also smith is just wonderful she doesn't <UNK> or her lesbian character too much messing is good too but she's not in this much bette midler is just hysterical in a small role and <UNK> <UNK> pulls off the nothing role of a <UNK> the direction is good too especially during a fashion show sequence i heard director diane english <UNK> had a lot of trouble directing her first full length movie but it doesn't show in the final product also there are some clever references to the original mostly certain lines that were inserted with no fuss br br i saw this in an audience full of women there were a few guys but not many and they loved it the movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling so this wasn't needed but it's not the disaster people are saying it is also people are saying we don't need a movie with all women well why not i see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this with a better performance by ryan i might have given this an 8 or 9 but as it is i can only give it a 7
<START> <UNK> through the comments there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie and it's not very hard to see why it's rubbish br br now i will start by saying that the finished product was hurt in any number of ways by the death of donald <UNK> dr <UNK> in post production this required a re of the film's conclusion with <UNK> buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with micheal <UNK> places with mysterious man in black and i do not mean johnny cash br br now to the story the fifth movie ended rather <UNK> with micheal myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black it turns out <UNK> that this man knows the origin of <UNK> evil and is also a colleague of dr <UNK> named dr <UNK> they also kidnapped jamie lloyd played by <UNK> harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by <UNK> <UNK> jamie pregnant escapes from dr <UNK> <UNK> and so micheal follows her and kills her but she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew br br we hear some ludicrous explanation to <UNK> evil involving <UNK> <UNK> down and mysterious symbols a radio show is broadcast from <UNK> home town for some reason which gives micheal some more hapless victims br br in the end the movie just like this review is vague confusing and <UNK> with a very <UNK> ending br br some sex scenes and nudity poor plot passable effects with some good run of the mill slasher kills but severely lacking in motivation for what was supposed to explain everything this only <UNK> up some new questions made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in <UNK> to end his life and career
<START> well this is about as good as they come there are arguments about whether hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a <UNK> <UNK> or was he really deep nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but it's legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at once br br in this one he seems to be about at his peak hardly anything in it is accidental it <UNK> with doubt ambiguity and wit and the story is engrossing patricia <UNK> apparently having <UNK> similar to hitchcock's own br br i'm sure the plot has been thoroughly <UNK> elsewhere so i won't bother going into it i'll just point out five on screen incidents that hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for br br bruno <UNK> walker has followed <UNK> laura miller and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her she's noticed his attention and is <UNK> <UNK> by it br br 1 laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the tunnel of love and then to an island in the center of the lake walker is right behind them smiling in his boat <UNK> <UNK> it's not an <UNK> to the walt disney cartoon character it's a reference to <UNK> also called <UNK> a god of the underworld in greek and roman mythology this tiny touch can't be an accident and the underworld that walker represents is not just a literal hell but the underworld of the human mind i hate to say he's a <UNK> shadow but that's what he is did carl <UNK> see this movie he was alive at the time of its release but probably not 2 now this is a deadly serious sequence right walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesn't even know imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors a night time stalking through a crowded carnival stealing from shadow to shadow the killer <UNK> from behind the <UNK> walls and so forth what does hitchcock show us when walker first comes through the gates <UNK> on his victim a little boy in a cowboy suit holding a balloon runs up and shouts bang bang you're dead walker <UNK> his head back in surprise and <UNK> down <UNK> at the kid and when the kid starts to walk away walker <UNK> his cigarette at the balloon and pops it then continues his pursuit without another glance that's one way hitchcock treats impending doom br br 3 the famous <UNK> reflected in the fallen <UNK> which has been <UNK> <UNK> times br br 4 <UNK> and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big <UNK> sending a kind of hockey <UNK> up the <UNK> to measure the strength of your blow one of her boyfriend it and the <UNK> doesn't reach the bell at the top under delighted and <UNK> <UNK> walker smiles and <UNK> his hands together then picks up the <UNK> <UNK> it down and the <UNK> <UNK> against the bell she's thrilled he puts the <UNK> down looks at her <UNK> and his <UNK> at her like a ten year old 5 after the discovery of body while <UNK> blow and people shout walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the <UNK> walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the <UNK> <UNK> holding up his hand to stop the traffic a macabre joke br br these incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit robert <UNK> performance is exceptional throughout it's essentially a kind of <UNK> to be <UNK> <UNK> ride the pink horse but the menace of the scene is <UNK> by hitchcock's <UNK> on irony and distance none of the familiar noir techniques are employed there's nothing really creepy about it and the murder itself is hardly a savage one i don't think that any director other than hitchcock would have handled it the way he did it would have been all menace and shadows hiding places <UNK> attempts <UNK> instead of <UNK> br br not that it's an entirely flawless movie a flawless movie is not yet with us some of the middle section is a bit slow going and <UNK> granger although a nice guy is <UNK> dull and rather stupid his new girl friend is just dull br br hitchcock was to treat the of guilt with deadly seriousness in the wrong man i'm not sure hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt the latter was <UNK> on him at an early age by his catholic education original sin you're born with it and all that in filmed interviews he always explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some <UNK> we're justified in asking if that was only what <UNK> calls a screen memory i hope you get the pun i know i know it's strained and inept but i spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up
<START> terry and june in my mind is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in 1994 i have all the dvds <UNK> press and i look forward to getting all 9 also would be nice to see happy after ever released on dvd br br june <UNK> is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memory br br terry scott r i p there aren't many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples <UNK> but i don't mind i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott
<START> my wife and i met doing a professional production of the merry widow in 1982 in english but a straight translation br br only the very basic <UNK> of the original plot is visible in this adaptation most of the characters have been deleted along with the entire b plot and all but one of the characters remaining have been <UNK> most of the characters in the movie aren't in the <UNK> either the action has been moved from paris to at first washington <UNK> and then to the fictional country of which the movie has <UNK> and only later to paris the net result is that we don't reach the beginning of the original play until about 45 minutes in br br and the main source of tension in the plot is deleted too in the original years before count and the heroine were very much in love but his family refused to allow them to marry because she was poor it's his broken heart that has rendered him a <UNK> playboy now that as a widow she's the <UNK> woman in the world she still loves him and he still loves her but his pride won't let him admit it to anyone even himself and she must spend three acts playing mind games to break him down the <UNK> of the aristocrat with money problems who won't admit that he's in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think <UNK> the main plots of a substantial <UNK> of <UNK> for decades after the <UNK> widow in this movie they've never met before which rips out not only the heart of the whole thing but nearly all the comedy br br lamas does a pretty decent job though br br an interesting musical point is that several times we hear a <UNK> or so of <UNK> an extra song written in english despite the title for the london which was not as far as i know usually found in american productions until the 1980s or so
<START> having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as well br br what bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them i remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published yes it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten about the <UNK> i read back then in which tim robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other br br and i think that is completely right i have to admit that i believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti death penalty side but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice and this is a very rare thing in american films br br i have shown this movie to many people since it came out and i have seen all kinds of reactions death penalty supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief and many death penalty opponents including me grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be <UNK> everywhere in the world but i have even seen opponents turn into supporters this and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it so whatever effect it has on you the important thing is that it makes you think br br this is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent this may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or <UNK> a lesson there is no lesson here you need to find one yourself br br everyone <UNK> the acting directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the i will not repeat it all again br br so if you have not seen this yet do so if you dare to be challenged
<START> unfortunately this film is typical of the <UNK> down of a good film by numerous sequels universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s which were pale <UNK> of the original the intelligent <UNK> <UNK> has been replaced by a leg dragging frankenstein in mummy who <UNK> no signs of intelligent life this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy 1932 you will be disappointed
<START> br br mild spoilers ahead br br we dive at dawn is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the screen may be it was the big screen viewing that helped br br i still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled but once the submarine leaves the <UNK> and begins its mission the movie takes off too the search for the german <UNK> named the and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting br br i'm increasing my rating to 7 10 if you enjoy <UNK> ii films i think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets <UNK> some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor too
<START> being a child of the 1980s i grew up with numerous educational as well as programs or both and continue to learn so much from them now that i admire the wisdom of those who worked on them after learning that <UNK> street to name the best example was not solely responsible for the fact that i could read at an adult level before i could walk it only <UNK> the level of disgust i feel not only towards the <UNK> corporation and its product but those who defend them too as if i had faith in those we <UNK> to protect us or our children to begin with the fact that barney friends still <UNK> our <UNK> after more than a decade later is a <UNK> not only to the <UNK> american <UNK> and its makers it is a <UNK> to all of humanity in a world where i can be <UNK> without <UNK> by the police <UNK> services and child protection <UNK> simply for being born different to those in power yet <UNK> are allowed to <UNK> this drivel into my home <UNK> you have to ask what is wrong with people br br you see in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone not only are our attempts to make our children more normal more alike more think alike potentially devastating what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play too so the question becomes one of what barney is teaching our children to be normal apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short other shocking things we are shown on the barney show include barney <UNK> children the issue of child <UNK> and child <UNK> is a big one in our society and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic br br so far i have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally <UNK> lessons barney himself presents adding to the problem is the children shown on the show i use the word children loosely here as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as <UNK> yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme <UNK> year olds react to barney and his <UNK> situations in the exact same way as five year olds experts in childhood and adolescent <UNK> especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to adults on the <UNK> spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flat out ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with barney that would make <UNK> year olds cry as <UNK> and sick as shows targeted toward the elder child market such as you can't do that on television were they <UNK> all over barney by <UNK> that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways so too do different people br br so in response to i have to say that i hope like hell they do not have children for every time i see a parent showing their child this drivel it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse and i speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse they might sing about manners loving caring or sharing but the examples they show are not only so as to be the opposite of educational they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous as the light <UNK> has already pointed out the kind of lessons children learn from barney are that people do not <UNK> feelings must be <UNK> at all costs and rules are entirely <UNK> when compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy it still <UNK> the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and <UNK> this trash off the air if a parent did to their child what barney does around the world they would face criminal charges br br hence i gave barney my favourite two out of ten score that i give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value in a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children it has no place
<START> three zany couples all six of a kind become <UNK> in a <UNK> search for stolen bank <UNK> br br this is a lively hilarious comedy with the six stars charlie mary <UNK> w c fields alison george burns <UNK> allen all <UNK> engaged in doing what they did best getting laughs br br <UNK> make another of their film appearances as husband wife this time rather more <UNK> than usual they were a perfect team she the <UNK> <UNK> he the nervous rabbit and they dominate most of the screen time here from beginning to end they are a delight br br burns allen continue the <UNK> they <UNK> in vaudeville <UNK> on radio would eventually take to television with george the <UNK> straight man <UNK> the eternal fool at times in the film she tends to go a bit over the top but it's difficult to dislike her her heart was obviously made of solid gold br br while is given rather short <UNK> only <UNK> of her <UNK> personality flash through fields is in his element as the <UNK> sheriff of <UNK> whether explaining how he got the <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> about at night looking for the missing he is never less than wonderful best of all he gets to perform his entire classic pool routine <UNK> it forever for a grateful <UNK> finally he <UNK> the near <UNK> he gets <UNK> to shut up br br paramount was so pleased with the success of six of a kind that they wanted to hurry the principle players into another comedy only fields he felt he had now arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics the studio finally agreed and began <UNK> of <UNK> first solo starring feature you're telling me 1934
<START> has expanded the limits of john <UNK> mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director writer and producer this film was dreadful it is disjointed and from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line br br we are served with a <UNK> of <UNK> scenes each a non <UNK> to all the others the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre <UNK> company the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently can't tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story br br if this story were a person it would be a <UNK> with personality disorder it couldn't decide if it was a drama a romance a comedy a tragedy a sex farce or a parody of theatre it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce br br <UNK> was lifeless and <UNK> as supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce for a role unfortunately she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the <UNK> of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination <UNK> gave a delightful performance as the <UNK> theatre critic who makes <UNK> <UNK> to a member of the cast beverly <UNK> and ben <UNK> also had minor roles br br i gave this film a 2 other than <UNK> <UNK> there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were <UNK> <UNK> and beautiful avoid this movie like the plague that it is br br
<START> two city guys are driving through <UNK> usa when a rusty monster truck suddenly appears and repeatedly attempts to run them off the road having picked up a mysterious blonde <UNK> they pull up at a truck stop full of redneck <UNK> one of whom warns them of 'the demon out <UNK> but they don't listen big mistake monster man by michael davis mixes comedy with horror surprisingly well the film borrows heavily from duel the blair witch project <UNK> <UNK> and the texas chainsaw massacre the story is pretty silly but there is enough gore and violence to keep splatter freaks happy i enjoyed especially the performance of justin <UNK> which offers the film its comedy relief still the complete lack of suspense is hard to forgive give this one a chance if you have some time to waste 7 out of 10 did i mention that <UNK> brooks is sexy
<START> first things first how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head what exactly is director trying to say br br if its a thriller there are no thrills if its action there is no action <UNK> a chase sequence there is no drama and the much <UNK> love story it actually never takes off no passion emotion nothing is there br br actually i never expected wonders from the movie however after the <UNK> opening it took i thought of giving it a chance i have no problems with <UNK> whatsoever and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one br br let's not put the blame of <UNK> he is just a <UNK> actor but direction screenplay writing makeup everything has gone for a toss br br <UNK> is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the <UNK> he can do the don kind of roles is just a kid and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks br br the only actor who was good was the friend of <UNK> in the movie i don't know his name but he looks promising br br watch it at your own risk not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing br br strongly recommend to avoid this movie
<START> <UNK> love starts with great promise as directed by p j hogan the film works great up until the last third of the movie when it falls flat on its face the screen play mr hogan and <UNK> wrote showed a <UNK> of possibilities that <UNK> at the end it appears the artistic team behind the movie had great hopes for it to play differently the reality is this is a film that is looking in different directions in how to bring it to a resolution that ultimately fails don't get me wrong the movie is tremendously appealing and will <UNK> with a lot of its viewing public br br based on the strong cast we decided to take a look the tremendously talented kathy bates is the perfect choice to play grace <UNK> the woman who finds at the beginning of the film that all is not well in her marriage ms bates is an excellent actress who deserved much better even when her character is not helped by what the authors have her do in the film br br rupert everett is always <UNK> into delivering his role as the late victor <UNK> lover is well written that is until <UNK> is <UNK> into coming to chicago to find <UNK> murderer it's bizarre and it defies all rules of logic <UNK> doesn't look capable of hurting a fly let alone hunt down a killer with the help of grace and her daughter in law the incredible funny br br as played by meredith <UNK> this little woman is one of the best things in the film she's is <UNK> and tells it as she sees it peter <UNK> one of the best actors working in films these days has nothing to do in the picture he is totally wasted dan <UNK> also has nothing to do we see him at the beginning and at the end of the film and his max doesn't make sense he appears to want changes in his life and his marriage only to come back to grace without any explanation all things forgiven br br the english actors are good <UNK> redgrave has a better opportunity as the hysterical jonathan <UNK> is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing bland songs julie andrews makes a funny contribution in a couple of priceless scenes br br ultimately the television show <UNK> by sally jesse <UNK> is a turn off and doesn't add anything to the movie the best part is hearing kathy bates singing what a beautiful voice she has in fact ms bates is the best excuse for staying until the end
<START> why do people make bad movies didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point there is something about this picture that threw me off besides the fact that i found this movie to be unrealistic pathetic and poorly acted i admire them for the try but the actors in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent this movie deserves zero stars but i did not have that option so it gets a 1
<START> i sort of liked this columbo movie its atmosphere which was real thriller like and its approach even at times reminded me of film noir in the movie its first 30 minutes or so it's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way with the right camera angles and use of light it doesn't mean instantly that this movie is a brilliant one though but its solid enough to consider this a good late columbo movie entry it's definitely a better movie than the average columbo movie entry br br 26 years after his previous columbo movie appearance george hamilton returns once again to play the main lead opposite peter falk again as the murderer in a total different and new role of course i liked him in his role and he was a good columbo who gave the good old lieutenant some good competition they had some nice sequences together problem with the <UNK> new columbo movies always sort of had been that it didn't feature a good well known actor opposite peter falk this movie obviously doesn't suffer from this problem but i must say though that this movie doesn't feature peter falk at this best he has certainly played the character better and his performance isn't quite consistent enough within this movie which is probably also due to he movie its director <UNK> duke who also directed the really dreadful movie <UNK> pan among many other projects br br it has a rather good and enjoyable story but the fact that the same sort of plot to cover up the murder had been used before in an earlier columbo movie also doesn't help of course it got used before in the 1975 movie columbo <UNK> nevertheless it of course also still has plenty enough <UNK> moments of its own with its story even though of course in essence every columbo movie is more or less the same but oh well that is what made the columbo series so great and consistent if it ain't broke don't fix it br br it also is true that within this movie more clues than usual are left out for the lieutenant which doesn't mean that the movie its murderer is more stupid or sloppy but i more see it as the writers being more overly enthusiastic than others it doesn't make the movie or story bad and it in fact perhaps even makes it more enjoyable to see columbo hard at work and discovering all kind of small but important clues luckily the movie is also filled with some enjoyable effective <UNK> columbo comedy br br simply a good late columbo movie entry br br 7 10
<START> i was born in <UNK> with not much <UNK> <UNK> as far as what i watched on tv as a kid in the 70's i always loved this movie and the french connection and would always try to catch it whenever it was on checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say i still love it roy s was a great actor from the 70's jaws is one of my all time marathon man etc and although the 7 ups is not an oscar worthy film it puts you precisely in a time a place ny early 70's as did french connection and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time and yes the car chase is one of the all time best
<START> this is <UNK> funny well except when bruce is in the hospital scene which is a little sad br br ted <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are both excellent and worth watching br br sure it's not a big budget suit controlled blockbuster but it's everything it promises to be and more and btw the women are wonderful in their parts though i don't know them from other movies i'd welcome seeing them again br br the two brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for <UNK> outstanding physical comedy he is one <UNK> guy br br thanks bruce for your brain this is your baby
<START> funny yes a <UNK> classic to watch <UNK> turn green is always a treat and it brings us back to the days when cartoon slapstick was brave and <UNK> for the adult mind br br loved it
<START> i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadn't seen one that i hadn't liked br br the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and <UNK> yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an <UNK> childish inept <UNK> i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if you're short on <UNK> maybe you shouldn't have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least <UNK> from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision br br there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems br br two final questions br br who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now br br how many times did this guy say man
<START> <UNK> is a successful business man a perfect father and a good husband or that is what everybody think the perfect storyline he has carefully built all along these years will start closing around him all of a sudden will he be able to keep up with his own lies br br this is a very well laid out drama with great acting and steady direction even though the plot is pushed up to the limit to increase the tension the movie explores some of our worst fears do we really know the people we deal with can we be so sure br br the story develops at an increasingly faster pace as it reaches the point where <UNK> is not in control of his lies anymore a good deal of spanish movies have interesting stories but are far from technical <UNK> the perfect rhythm and well shot scenes make the actors so credible we get inside <UNK> and hate him and suffer for him as his situation gets more and more desperate there is no need for any spanish <UNK> nor is this an attempt to create a hollywood style flick this is real spain 2002 and regardless the obvious of life existing in reality there are good chances somebody we know is not quite like the person he claims to be not just a great commercial product it will let you wondering where lies can get us to can we keep up br br well done
<START> i first was made aware of this film when i saw a preview before another movie i was intrigued but it didn't get to see it before it's short run in theaters was done br br it is not an easy movie to watch multiple times there is much violence inflicted upon <UNK> civilians there are lessons to be learned here one of patricia <UNK> lines sums up on to americans if it didn't happen on tv it just didn't happen there is a lot of truth to that br br another is that at one point she thinks that just because she <UNK> she is an american citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass it doesn't work that way br br the scenery is beautiful the acting is all decent the professor is especially good mainly though i care about these characters francis and gray are fine but their appearance is short so they don't matter much patricia has guts in the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly as it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military <UNK> in the world in this century and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their <UNK> br br san is the female political leader in the movie in real life she won the <UNK> peace prize she was only recently released from house arrest the w bush administration as of the date i write this is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re form the government the government was under such <UNK> that is changed the name of the country to the republic the u s government has yet to the new name br br if you don't <UNK> a message in your movie don't watch this one if you don't mind a little with your entertainment then it's a fine one
<START> no no is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless cgi movies being made the <UNK> and color <UNK> backgrounds were a surprise after <UNK> to <UNK> no spirited away and no <UNK> <UNK> moving castle being so similar <UNK> the style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well the time and effort put in to <UNK> this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better there are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action the greatest to me being a scene were sisters <UNK> into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them the story is simple but fairly well written and played out the plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it wasn't played out as well as in no <UNK> my neighbor <UNK> it is still great i felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike spirited away which was so <UNK> with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series the <UNK> spirit there was a another whole movie right there my only real problem with the movie was the end the way its <UNK> in the english version at least makes it seem like there's going to be some great test given to which turns out to be just him promising mother that he will love though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it the movie did seem to end abruptly though other than that the movie was great and i highly recommend it
<START> this is a new approach to comedy it isn't funny br br the joke is that this in and of itself is supposed to be funny br br the story is based on a french short story located in paris and the characters have french names louis for example played by bob <UNK> the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carry on movies from years back br br i believe these are also jokes to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way to have them <UNK> in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy and to leave the whole <UNK> mystery unexplained to the audience br br in the humour department this is practically the round table isn't it br br the movie tries to be charming and quirky and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny not as funny as duck soup or love and death perhaps but funnier than the deer hunter or the <UNK> <UNK> br br it is an example of personal filmmaking it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience but stays true to its premise and its internal logic although all the situations are unbelievable they are logical within the film's own <UNK> world br br i generally like this kind of eccentric movie but i found this one to be paced too slowly to be dull witted tedious and to provide too few <UNK> surprises or genuine wit it just kind of <UNK> in predictable and <UNK> ways and wastes some wonderful talents along the way it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars who are all otherwise distinguished players i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the <UNK> and i wish i had never seen goldblum and <UNK> in this thing br br so call it an interesting miss and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill br br
<START> this movie was horrendous it had absolutely nothing to do with dark <UNK> and the dvd was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a <UNK> neither of which appeared in this movie br br the beginning was a <UNK> of random scenes that most of which had nothing to do with the movie except that they sort of show that the man is psychic but not too well br br after the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his daughters it gets vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before but that's the extent of it br br and why might i ask was this movie rated r there were two drops of blood and 4 curse words and how on earth did it get into a video store this movie was poorly acted poorly filmed poorly written and overall horribly executed
<START> a teen aged girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by an ex <UNK> to participate in <UNK> grand national a fine adaptation of the classic children's book with an excellent start making performance by taylor as the energetic but polite <UNK> rooney is ok as her <UNK> although he has some overly melodramatic moments crisp and <UNK> are quite good as <UNK> loving parents filmed in technicolor it looks beautiful the problems are that there are corny elements nothing very interesting happens and it drags on a bit too long the race is exciting but could have been much more so
<START> the man with the golden arm otto <UNK> controversial <UNK> crime drama plays itself out among the mental <UNK> of its living and <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> opening the film a <UNK> from within a bar of frankie looking in through the window already tells us to the <UNK> that the <UNK> <UNK> experience will grasp pulled in the direction of increasingly <UNK> spaces the film <UNK> itself off as the local <UNK> long drawn out poker game <UNK> itself from the daylight <UNK> itself in as sinatra's frankie machine has himself locked in a room in the celebrated scene of his harrowing struggle to overcome his habit in <UNK> into the <UNK> and faces of its <UNK> urban <UNK> the visual traffic in the man with the golden arm <UNK> <UNK> psychological circumstances <UNK> an <UNK> environment as <UNK> by the recurring tracking shots into closeups of <UNK> eyes br br the grace of this fiery drama striking as early as the exciting opening <UNK> shot displays the command over the <UNK> world that studio production allows the wonderfully <UNK> urban sets define an independent place with no <UNK> or ends an <UNK> state the sort that in reality hardly last as long as this <UNK> row seems to before being <UNK> or <UNK> the flair of certain performances particularly robert as the wonderfully named underworld gambling boss and arnold as <UNK> <UNK> four eyed <UNK> becomes this fiery surreal feature <UNK> the premise of drug addiction sinatra's <UNK> performance elmer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jazz score and <UNK> famous influential and controversial opening sequence <UNK> on the animated paper cut out of a heroin <UNK> arm <UNK> that in its era the man with the golden arm <UNK> forward upon the cause for realism in the still <UNK> hollywood it is <UNK> and <UNK> as i say but its intent its force and its spirit are much closer to home br br what <UNK> me the most in this film is its aspect as a gangster film it has the illegal card games short cons the fights the guns the double crosses characters on the <UNK> a femme fatale a stunningly sexy gun <UNK> the shady <UNK> and urban landscape but it does more than exploit this environment for entertainment really it is the perfect environment and genre in which to tell this story a crime ridden urban <UNK> where it's all too comfortable to escape through a bottle or two or three or four or drugs a <UNK> dose that really just functions to keep one in obscurity from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios the world could <UNK>
<START> extremely boring i don't care how many avant garde bones you have in your body this baby sucks and don't go and see it because i mentioned that save it for <UNK> empire it's far more entertaining i have seen other films that were far better so i am <UNK> why this is considered a masterpiece as an art <UNK> i have had to consider radical works by marcel chris burden and <UNK> <UNK> and in these artist i can still see artistic intent even quality and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art as for india song it's not even soft porn <UNK> was almost here g rated slide show of sex and a voice over that does not relate to the slide show movie pure crap and not even campy sadly just a bore and a waste of 2 hours to add insult to injury the print i saw was faded and <UNK> to hell <UNK> film archive if i want to see entertaining boring i watch <UNK> yes india song hold your head high to late <UNK> and be truly bored watch a 70's porn film with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down you'll get india song but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screams of the vice <UNK>
<START> i first saw this on <UNK> television and loved it i subsequently saw a dreadful write up by someone who certainly hadn't watched or listened to it so i bought a copy and then i bought another copy the only sad thing is that it is not available on pal vhs or region 2 dvd the australian version is great but this one is better i might buy another
<START> this may not be the worst movie ever made but it is absolutely the most boring wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark and mostly with vincent <UNK> walking away from the camera or looking down because he doesn't want to show his face for actually <UNK> to being in this movie i liked his early stuff but the <UNK> of the brown bunny and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a <UNK> in my book and val kilmer i actually want to send him a sympathy card the doors to this actually the casting was the only reason i watched this movie and val doesn't even show up until the movie is more than halfway over simply a sad movie
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen after watching it i walk out like what happened i am confused to this day can someone explain that movie to me please both the acting and picture quality are so bad you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder first i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie because it's unbelievably bad movie this movie isn't scary at all there is even no typical horror clichés too the plot and acting of this movie was terrible it's not fantastic <UNK> or horror it's just <UNK> bad turkish feature film and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters when i watch i fell into so hopeless so sad for young turkish movie maker please please don't make <UNK> like this
<START> another gray horrible bit of <UNK> from the family corman the first space capsule into outer space crash lands back on earth with some of the worst special effects ever and the pilot appears to be dead but appearances can be <UNK> he's actually more alive than the rest of the cast including a <UNK> <UNK> old doctor who'd also really really boring a <UNK> guy who looks like he's <UNK> the market on hair oil another guy so dull he doesn't even make much of an impression a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry over the old guy's <UNK> and a female photographer with a <UNK> fawcett <UNK> pre <UNK> of course and about as much <UNK> as a dead duck br br what are any of these people's names i think it was steve apparently everyone in the cast including the women were called steve anyway the dead pilot steve turns out to not only be alive but to be baby aliens or or <UNK> or whatever inside his <UNK> the <UNK> beast that <UNK> these little <UNK> looks like a giant bald parrot with <UNK> once again i am impressed by the laugh ability factor of the monsters created by the house of corman the space <UNK> from <UNK> in it <UNK> the world is still officially the worst most laughable monster i've ever seen grace the screen but the <UNK> always manage to deliver when it comes to bad cheesy looking monsters br br they also managed to deliver on their other <UNK> as well i e a boring confusing plot long gray shots thank god corman did most of his films in black and white since his color stuff still manages to look somehow gray two or three locations max stupid and lame props and special effects and lots and lots of dull dialog there's only two deaths in the film if you don't counted the <UNK> parrot <UNK> alien blood beast being <UNK> at the end of the film cheers <UNK> out through the land i'm sure when the alien rips the old doctor's head off and apparently eats it now it can talk in english and has the doctor's memories it can also move the pregnant astronaut around as though he were <UNK> br br the <UNK> apparent intent is to <UNK> its race using human beings as food and giant there's a confusing bit at the end well more confusing than usual anyway in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this but it makes no sense whatsoever something about how humanity is about to follow in its <UNK> footsteps and destroy themselves by something they'll soon create it never really said what that was it could have been anything from <UNK> <UNK> to digital watches who knows its baby <UNK> stabs himself rather than let the alien <UNK> crawl out of his body and the <UNK> guy and the other guy burn the parrot alien to death with a <UNK> cocktail <UNK> the smell of <UNK> chicken <UNK> alien end of story in which the rest of the characters wander off and leave their dead <UNK> laying on the ground to <UNK> oh hell why not save yourself the expense of a funeral i'm sure that was what corman was thinking when he was trying to cut <UNK> and make his scenes as cheaply as possible
<START> at 2 <UNK> a high school student commits suicide not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known time <UNK> back to the start of the day from here we follow six separate students marcus melody luke steven sarah and sean each student is struggling with their own moral <UNK> all reaching <UNK> point hitting to an end for one br br after losing a friend to suicide and surviving his own suicide attempt writer director k has created a drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows 2 <UNK> is attempt to bring it to light if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has 2 <UNK> becomes all the harder to view br br with heavy and hard subject matter also <UNK> everyday teenage life sex <UNK> sexual identity bullying friendship manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner the factor on talent is his subtlety he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime it <UNK> near documentary at times it has such a painful realism the interviews with each character spliced through the film only <UNK> this br br 2 <UNK> has a distinctive similarity to gus van film elephant while the core of each film is different both tackle teen life like <UNK> <UNK> long tracking shots with time skipping back and forth to show each characters interaction from different perspectives a defining point to elephant was its <UNK> ambiance with spare conversation little development of characters and the long tracking shots <UNK> created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread while there <UNK> this dread in 2 <UNK> the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level <UNK> couldn't reach as time goes by each characters <UNK> creeps out dragging you along their emotional roller coaster br br the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide <UNK> at the very beginning the hard part about this scene is the complete <UNK> and <UNK> we have as an audience watching <UNK> life end in a gruesome fashion though many films that have shown suicide <UNK> over the act or the act shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution with <UNK> in the leads and their first major roles <UNK> frank sweet joel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> charles and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers br br compelling and 2 <UNK> is an absolutely <UNK> film
<START> br br my favorite science fiction incredible ride through <UNK> and the <UNK> of reality probably the best performance i have ever seen jude law play incredibly original with interesting character developments and a story line that twists and turns so rapidly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully <UNK> its genius even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning
<START> i was trying to work out why i enjoyed this film its not because of money spent on it that's for sure did i see a painted water pistol in there maybe they don't have the same sort of visual effects houses in the scotland or maybe they just didn't have any money the making of clearly shows a gang of very <UNK> guys making a movie against the odds awesome but what i really liked was the <UNK> of the performances mike <UNK> and patrick white play the lead parts like 2 normal guys no hollywood <UNK> here br br ok so the effects work isn't very good the <UNK> just don't look as good as they should in todays fx world and i've seen much better free stuff on youtube but the film holds together very well once they get to the planet was this filmed in scotland or just by a scottish crew or is it just better effects work did they edit out the water by the end i kinda loved this film and was disappointed when they all died
<START> i read about this film on line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received and viewing the trailer i decided to check it out for myself what a disappointment it starts out well enough the opening scene was actually pretty tense but from there it's all downhill i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie but by doing so they took all the enjoyment out of watching it those choices combined with the c s i editing use of music and montage lack of suspense scares or humor really drag this film down there's too much <UNK> and to many subtle clues so when the first twist arrives early on you already know how the movie is going to end i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job other than that i can't recommend this movie
<START> the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in people come looking for a b grade horror film or a so bad it's good movie jack frost 2 is neither of these br br it is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely scary movies combined is to the movie on a basic level it would be like watching <UNK> redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions br br the premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of jack frost take a vacation to a <UNK> island a new improved jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of <UNK> man from spider man essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly <UNK> himself <UNK> himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an <UNK> to his only former weakness <UNK> br br what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre br br most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably particularly funny among them are ray playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early <UNK> christopher <UNK> offering an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights br br the lack of memorable quotes <UNK> me br br as a horror movie jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman rates a zero but you have to understand it's not a horror movie
<START> oh there are many worse wayne movies this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable the villain is an <UNK> actor who sports ridiculous mexican clothes and affects an over the top mexican accent which is hilarious the girl is dressed like a jean harlow wannabe this is 1934 after all at least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable br br watch it and laugh don't expect a serious western but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor wayne is almost <UNK> young and handsome and one can see his acting ability <UNK> years after this <UNK> venture
<START> i don't see the point it's <UNK> the animated people are creepy look up uncanny valley scenes go on and on and on for very little purpose the plot is <UNK> and must be padded out with lots of meaningless dramatic screaming roller coaster rides as if disney or spielberg were planning an amusement park ride based on the movie most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene they don't they just <UNK> with no lasting impact somebody summed it up as if you don't believe in santa claus you'll be kidnapped on a train on christmas eve that pretty much sums it up
<START> another son of sam is definitely not an oscar winner technically it's horrible the acting is not too good either but there is something about it that makes you want to watch more sort of like a car wreck the ridiculous close ups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything if you are looking for a scare this ain't the flick for you it's very obscure and nearly impossible to find i'm sure there's a reason for that for a while it was titled hostage it don't matter what you call it it's still a poor choice for entertainment it might be good for a <UNK> party or something can you believe they would use such a title as another son of sam if that don't have exploitation written all over it i'll eat my hat i remember when this was shot in <UNK> <UNK> a lot of local personalities were used as talent
<START> if you are a six year old boy who's into dinosaurs you will love this movie if you are anybody else you'll be rolling your eyes about every 15 seconds if you want to start picking on things like the acting the special effects the dialogue or the absence of a coherent plot that makes even the slightest amount of sense you'll have plenty of material if all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid it will do just fine that said there's a lot of kids' entertainment out there that's much smarter and some of it is even bearable or enjoyable for adults unless your child is in an <UNK> dinosaur mood you're probably better off looking for something else
<START> celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies the cinema is <UNK> with failed attempts and one can go on and on <UNK> why john never made it big as an actor instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects <UNK> right in playing the lead in falling from grace which he also directed and the results are as awkward and <UNK> as that title story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks opening up old family wounds boasts a screenplay by larry but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly the supporting cast is decent including kay <UNK> whom it's always nice to see <UNK> <UNK> and claude <UNK> who share the one really strong scene in the picture as for john's acting he doesn't look particularly comfortable despite apparent efforts to make him look at home he seems to be <UNK> the camera most of the time and he never <UNK> with the audience in an immediate way 1 2 from
<START> comedy is a hard beast to <UNK> fails on all accounts as a writer and director some things like making movies that are funny just need to be left to the professionals 1 out of 10 awful it wasn't funny i tried to laugh but it just wasn't funny i wasn't the only one no one else at the chicago festival was laughing either at least at the showing i saw simply very bad sorry
<START> this is a very famous ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie if you want to see some ninjas and some figures want to know some things about ninjas see this movie this movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia br br first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best you can just see ninja figures and fight in this scenes between these are below the average nearly bad as a movie acting is bad sho black ninja is the best actor in this movie frank <UNK> is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good scenario is also not good its so simple <UNK> comes near to his best old friend from army and war he also <UNK> him from mafia but he is having sex go to bed with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to <UNK> negative is this possible in life what a friendship br br finally this movie started a genre ninja movies also there is the ninja master sho <UNK> but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with <UNK> this film is below the average even it is a classic
<START> this experimental silent film made in switzerland by an independent british film company is <UNK> remembered as paul <UNK> first film it's very artistic with shots often seeming meaningless to the story which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter titles from what i gathered <UNK> wife is in an inter racial love affair with a white man called <UNK> it doesn't bother the <UNK> <UNK> owner of the bar hotel where <UNK> lives and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a <UNK> but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an inter title if i had my way we wouldn't allow <UNK> in here <UNK> is also called lover by someone in the bar tries a <UNK> with pete <UNK> but eventually leaves him wife <UNK> goes off the deep end <UNK> a knife cuts arm and cheek and somehow dies <UNK> must have been accused of murder because we learn he was <UNK> as for pete he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town so the film is more about racism than anything but in an up note the owner tells pete the sad thing is they think they're right that's the way we are the meaning of the title is a mystery it may refer to being light skinned a borderline <UNK> or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters
<START> i watched this one mostly to see charlie and <UNK> <UNK> two of my favorites br br the plot has many a twist and turn it's not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train br br but why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla i can mention this without it being a spoiler because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot br br the bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his <UNK> but the circus train wreck was purely <UNK> it allows for a single scene with a menacing gorilla but then it's back to the murder mystery
<START> as ben <UNK> once observed nothing goes <UNK> out of style than comedy steve <UNK> latest offering 'the pink <UNK> <UNK> recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box office while mike <UNK> 'the love seems to have won few <UNK> br br in 1970 it was jerry <UNK> turn to feel the pain of <UNK> ironically his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence when <UNK> way to the front ' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade br br in this world war two comedy he plays <UNK> the <UNK> man in the world who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty and also because he is bored with being successful but is rejected as he is <UNK> <UNK> he then decides to start his own <UNK> <UNK> army <UNK> other 4 <UNK> br br <UNK> out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by <UNK> in <UNK> they go into training some good visual gags here when they fire rocket <UNK> they look pleased with themselves until they learn they have just destroyed a oil station wishing to learn german brendan plays a long playing record called to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when this army sits down to eat instead of being in a mess hall they are in an <UNK> room <UNK> out with a <UNK> br br john wood is very funny as <UNK> ever so english butler his best scene is when he <UNK> a mafia type gangster into teaching <UNK> <UNK> to kill br br the script was not by jerry himself but by <UNK> <UNK> and dee caruso author of a number of episodes of 'the often has the look and feel of a television sitcom indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh track br br where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when <UNK> <UNK> a top nazi commander and after <UNK> the germans to <UNK> from the front gets involved in the plot to kill hitler and tom cruise is nowhere in sight as the commander jerry delivers a performance of such mind numbing <UNK> as to defy description he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the man <UNK> stakes it comes as a relief when the end credits appear br br perhaps the timing was just wrong bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea or the public simply had had enough of jerry that beard probably did not help what he needed here was a good producer someone to take him in hand and say that gag stinks throw it out <UNK> raise the bridge lower the <UNK> is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture br br as the <UNK> got <UNK> the new comedy icons would be woody allen mel brooks and monty python <UNK> more biting and in allen's case more human styles of comedy replaced <UNK> brand of slapstick it would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback as the <UNK> talk show host in martin <UNK> brilliant 'the king of <UNK>
<START> chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be like br br this film is about a young boy <UNK> <UNK> who works and lives with his teenage sister in a one room tiny <UNK> in an auto shop the story takes place in a part of new york city that i did not even know existed points where there are endless and body <UNK> here tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and <UNK> up a food van br br <UNK> makes money helping at the auto shop and helps at a food van both however earn extra money on the side <UNK> sells <UNK> movies and stolen car parts results to selling herself their lives are surrounded by <UNK> and grim but even though both witness live and barely survive within their harsh world their love for each other is never <UNK> by the filth that surround them and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay together br br the best comparison i have for chop shop is that <UNK> of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as <UNK> mama <UNK> combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an <UNK> environment just as in <UNK> br br having co written directed and edited both this film and his first man push <UNK> which won awards all over the world is a total package filmmaker br br i can only hope that his films will not be hidden <UNK> for long
<START> there have been numerous productions that tell of the development of the atomic bomb the robert taylor film above and beyond flag waving propaganda really if you believe this one you think that the army air <UNK> in the person of paul w ran the entire show the nbc produced gay probably a lot closer to the mark and the bbc tv series <UNK> with sam <UNK> in the title role br br fat man and little boy takes the same approach that the bbc series did but <UNK> it it avoids the gee <UNK> technology of the manhattan project and focuses on human aspects the personalities involved in the work instead of focusing on it covers a wide <UNK> of mythical but pretty typical people who were part of it br br with <UNK> dwight <UNK> did a good job as presenting a dreamy <UNK> tower academic who struggles to relate his <UNK> as a <UNK> to his <UNK> to view the world in a wider social and moral context only to have that struggle won by an <UNK> lust for personal power and glory in the day after <UNK> it was made clear that <UNK> viewed himself as a superior being by virtue of his vast wide ranging intellectual <UNK> in the end that was robert downfall he saw himself as a sort of <UNK> king a moral and intellectual superior who could and rightfully should wisely <UNK> what was best for the rest of the world re nuclear weapons development and <UNK> br br unfortunately wisdom doesn't <UNK> the actions of nations or direction of events on a global scale wisdom doesn't <UNK> <UNK> power when it tries to exercise such nonexistent power as found when he opposed the development of the super the <UNK> bomb wisdom is ignored and <UNK> by those who really have the power br br i found myself <UNK> character in one way his exposes himself too closely and personally to the manhattan project despite the doubts and fears that <UNK> at his intellectual basis the real <UNK> would have had to take a different approach at the beginning he would have had to come to the firm resolution that the project would result in ultimate good the <UNK> it produced along the way would be an incidental price that must be paid to <UNK> that ultimate good and it must be ignored at least until the end of the project when there was <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> clearly did that and it resulted in his controversial <UNK> statements to the effect that science had now known sin and that was a knowledge it could never lose br br while the project went on such <UNK> had to be pushed aside if he was to maintain his sanity br br because of this ambiguity <UNK> character comes off as a weak frightened little boy who could never have served as <UNK> of rapid <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> dubbed his post br br paul <UNK> take on gen leslie r is fascinating and a <UNK> performance if possibly a little bit over the top br br was a civil engineer by training but first and foremost he was a soldier and a general to boot he's <UNK> to demanding that things go his way intensely driven a foul mouthed spoiled child who has <UNK> at the drop of a hat who <UNK> his country and isn't too proud to fall on his knees and pray in other words very much like real ie non civil engineer soldiers aka george <UNK> mission not only comes first it is his only consideration feelings and <UNK> be damned except for his own of course br br couldn't admit it but he knew full well that he needed <UNK> military rank meant nothing in the world of <UNK> <UNK> was a necessary <UNK> between the two worlds he had to <UNK> br br again i have to fault the script on this and for the same reason br br in reality already owned if he didn't would never have been chosen for the post in the first place history tells of many cases where other scientists some as stellar as <UNK> simply walked away from <UNK> efforts at one point was so desperate that he <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> he needed br br attempts in the film to <UNK> and control were unnecessary they only exist here as a dramatic device which indeed helps make the atmosphere of the film quite ugly br br michael <UNK> is a <UNK> of several real characters but they're from a different time frame several research <UNK> similar to the one depicted happened in <UNK> weapons research br br radiation <UNK> creates another <UNK> in the film but one which is imho necessary and pretty accurate people with weak <UNK> will have a hard time handling the hospital sequences they're all too real br br the main idea that comes across but not strongly enough imho is the big truth of the los experience the scientists who signed on were young idealistic and naive as well as talented most were on their first <UNK> out of the shelter of the campus to them the project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without the constraints of budgets or excessive <UNK> <UNK> br br it was not only their brilliance but their youthful <UNK> that produced the atomic bomb br br there's plenty here to make the thoughtful viewer intensely uncomfortable about this movie just the same if you <UNK> out the hollywood <UNK> there isn't that much of it really this is probably a pretty accurate view of the inside of manhattan project
<START> there isn't enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movie's problems the film looks like it was conceived in the mid eighties and just until it could finally be made in the early nineties the <UNK> headed hero complete with <UNK> miami vice three days shadow beard the ham <UNK> <UNK> at ronald reagan it would be funny if it didn't take itself so seriously as it is the movie is just pathetic i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie
<START> when i was a child this was the movie i watched i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images <UNK> is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie
<START> i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show <UNK> e g the weak joke the princess and the <UNK> isn't exactly shakespeare is it that had <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> i don't see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv <UNK> so this can be shown 4 5 days a week isn't there anything better than this
<START> <UNK> christmas is very korean if you have been to korea or have korean friends you should know what i mean korean are very traditional people they see love very a kind of feeling you don't find in today's world i think that is why this film is so special it is wrong to compare this film with love letter by <UNK> <UNK> are very good but could never make one like <UNK> christmas if you have a chance please see this movie for yourself
<START> yes barney is nonsense now but when i was a kid it made perfect sense br br i haven't gotten any smarter but i enjoyed it as a child i was <UNK> because no one could say my name so i changed it ever since i was 4 i've gone by the name tina from barney because i could relate to her being from a different culture i'm 17 now and barney is a huge part of my life my name came from it i cant <UNK> the show i grew up with no matter how stupid it seems now br br i don't care if i get <UNK> i have nothing more to say they shouldn't make the minimum 10 lines because some people just don't have much to say ok done
<START> for <UNK> sometimes seems like a land of dreams a land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business find love start a new life etc but <UNK> has made this brilliant piece which shows that everything is not so good in <UNK> as well that <UNK> can be just as <UNK> the bad land than any other country it shows that people there can be just as miserable in their lives than we in everywhere else that sometimes there's nothing good this movie nicely shows why <UNK> is one of the top <UNK> countries it's not easy to live in north cold climate changes us i've become more and more attracted to <UNK> movies and this one is very good the acting is great as well <UNK> has become one of the top <UNK> stars beware of the sex scene if you have little children and a little depression that might come afterwards the movie 8 10
<START> gloria <UNK> as <UNK> porter is an understandably bored wife <UNK> husband elliott <UNK> as james porter has lost his romance along with his <UNK> he also <UNK> <UNK> in bed eats <UNK> and he can barely remember his own <UNK> which is attended by <UNK> cody as van the younger man eyes ms <UNK> figure and <UNK> <UNK> soon <UNK> is drawn to mr cody then mr <UNK> decides to try and get her back who will win br br the three principals are fine with <UNK> most impressive in the pivotal role as the woman torn julia faye grabs supporting <UNK> as <UNK> other interest off screen she tempted director cecil b demille the demille touch is evident especially in an imaginary sequence <UNK> cody promises <UNK> br br don't change your husband 1 26 19 cecil b demille gloria <UNK> elliott <UNK> <UNK> cody
<START> i have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing i ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget those that make you doubt your reality a problem could be the quality but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie br br the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer i just totally loved it so many clues and <UNK> and <UNK> one of the best movies ever hands down
<START> although it has been off the air for 6 years now promised land was one of those shows that comes along once or twice in a generation good cast supporting cast among them richard thomas and <UNK> davis and crew the plot is believable with <UNK> <UNK> up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many <UNK> and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier i think a lot of vietnam era veterans myself included could really relate to thought process in finally deciding on his course of action many of us did precisely the same thing in real life after returning from that war and finding that america was not the same place we left the show <UNK> not only values but a glimpse into what took place in one veterans life in those two respects alone i think it is one of the more poignant tv series of our time why this program only ran for 3 years is beyond me
<START> i had looked forward to viewing this movie it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it i was completely disappointed the acting was so overdone the script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and <UNK> them together to form one script br br spoilers was any cliche <UNK> in this movie there was a hit homosexuality prostitution a serial killer a fire numerous godfather <UNK> the main character in love with the prostitute cross dressing torture by the police <UNK> style <UNK> i could go on and on br br <UNK> like the godfather wannabe to the prostitute br br ben i don't want u to work anymore br br ben kim who would pay the rent if i didn't work br br unrealistic scenes we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks br br the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original i definitely do not recommend it and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so br br
<START> this film tried but ultimately it was a waste of talent it tried to hard to be sexy i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen <UNK> and <UNK> wilson who will find something besides tv's le femme <UNK> worthy of her talents i just didn't find even in ms <UNK> so called near seduction scene with mrs <UNK> any real emotion even though i know the <UNK> tried very hard to make the scene work if the sexual elements of <UNK> disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve neither did the murder element of the plot perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie and without this feeling a movie doesn't work for me if you are interested in a movie about <UNK> there are a least two films on either side of the to check out 1 the pleasure of bound which works well in a noir setting and 2 the more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in <UNK> kitchen called all over me it's a well defined indie from the mid 90's that handles that coming of age issue with feeling not forced sexuality both would be a better rental than mercy which has next to nothing
<START> i have seen this movie maybe a 100 times never grow tired of it i saw this movie the first time when i was 7 years old and it has left a mark in my memories since then its a enchanting love story that brings the sun out in most people even in the darkest times i think that this is a must see movie and one of anthony <UNK> best performance ever i just wish that the tv channels would send this movie more often it has inspired me in a good way and <UNK> will do that to many others if there is any actor i wanted to meet it would have been anthony quinn there will never be a like of him on the silver screens ever wish that anthony quinn was still alive may god bless his soul
<START> the 1977 animated live action hybrid version of <UNK> travels or rather ' since he only gets as far as didn't get much of a release and it's not too difficult to see why michel <UNK> comes up with some catchy tunes but they merely inspire <UNK> don black to the likes of one simple fact remains no one here suffers from growing pains ' richard harris once again over <UNK> in his passion for excessive makeup <UNK> down the <UNK> for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact he's at least 25 years too old for the role but at least he perhaps <UNK> <UNK> his larger than life <UNK> for a performance made up mainly of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> animation looks only slightly better than early morning french children's tv but peter <UNK> film is not nearly as bad as it sounds  the use of real model sets for the animated characters <UNK> back to max and dave <UNK> 1939 version while a couple of moments of satire do remain although it's definitely aimed at the youngest of children
<START> <UNK> may be as much about <UNK> a pre <UNK> identity as about drug <UNK> as a rural guy coming to <UNK> class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far <UNK> his <UNK> parents' acting success troubles <UNK> however when the new man is too new when it demands too big a departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing <UNK> and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the <UNK> between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim br br but what an exceptionally convincing honesty and <UNK> director zhang <UNK> and his actors bring to this journey no clichés no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to <UNK> character acts and <UNK> br br <UNK> is in his mid <UNK> he's a talented actor <UNK> vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally <UNK> the perfect recipe for his <UNK> soon he's the cool actor <UNK> by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most <UNK> he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> his acting means the arts friends and roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or <UNK> and his self criticism <UNK> by the <UNK> of success opens the doors to an irrational self doubt self hatred i didn't know how to act i felt like a phony and to readily available drugs to counter them he says i had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity br br from drugs and his false life is very <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his own <UNK> space <UNK> thinking speech <UNK> replace therapy the abstract is out and a great deal of his change occurs <UNK> not in <UNK> locations but mainly on green <UNK> under the <UNK> bridges and high rises of <UNK> the <UNK> is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to park the long spontaneous walks the <UNK> sun and rain <UNK> the sky <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> his are very specific he <UNK> in order to arrive all the while picking up <UNK> to a more real and realistic identity i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his <UNK> body which projects a kind of <UNK> <UNK> clumsy <UNK> humorous telling in a current <UNK> if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can <UNK> him to walk all night br br central to his comeback is the <UNK> of set roles to <UNK> his end to acting and his determination to a new identity he <UNK> his videos and tv and <UNK> his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist but he's the only <UNK> guide he knows he even <UNK> himself as john's son <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his mother mary as an in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the park <UNK> and <UNK> music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of <UNK> influence as showing me a new way in the mental <UNK> the life saving <UNK> resistance <UNK> reflect <UNK> presence as does need to re hang his hero's poster in his room br br if <UNK> influence is father's influence is <UNK> although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is differences from his son that his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that he's chinese a <UNK> in a line of <UNK> a rural theater director and he <UNK> control over both his habit and his emotions it's this recognizable identity that drives to treat him like a sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue <UNK> beatles and <UNK> in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he <UNK> him of being a liar and a fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts i acted before were <UNK> life is <UNK> and to <UNK> you are not my father he <UNK> replies why can't a <UNK> be your father br br under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the <UNK> he makes some <UNK> connection to a real not whole self as the long term drug effects so does his old identity <UNK> <UNK> pride trust <UNK> integrity his black cloud all his edges <UNK> you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the <UNK> down <UNK> for <UNK> medicine back home <UNK> <UNK> soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy says of this movie it's a good chance to think about my life and i might add become a new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without a loss of identity
<START> tim taylor is an abusive drug addict he's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person the only film with him in it that is enjoyable is galaxy quest and that just because his character a <UNK> out washed up actor from a former hit tv show was so close to real life for him the rest of the cast is equally bad i hate the mother and the actress that played her patricia richardson she sucks ever cliché is there the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children while in real life she's <UNK> family values and gets divorced after having twins and the child actors were about as interesting as a root <UNK>
<START> this documentary is as unique as it's subject and while <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time late night <UNK> one problem joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with <UNK> <UNK> even mixed in his gore films the gore films are cult classics going for like 20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net not <UNK> for 20 year old films folks i want to see why those are cult classics also as sweet as joe seems he did seem more elegant than one might expect the dude liked to shock both <UNK> the <UNK> story and <UNK> in america show us hardcore rape snuff and <UNK> in both you'd be <UNK> how far he goes in <UNK> ii with that one if you can track down an uncut print although these scenes may be in a documentary of a persons career hey he did it also i would have liked to see more interviews of people joe worked with maybe that's just me wanting to see what laura <UNK> looks like these days i still think she's a <UNK> and one of the <UNK> women ever to grace the genre
<START> what an atomic bomb of a movie the story goes nowhere and comes nowhere it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying is this it what happened to redford he was once a fair actor now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take wrong what an <UNK> film i don't mean to be so so cruel but what crap of a movie unbelievable amateur crap if i was in this movie i would be so that i would not show my face i tell you what if i was associated with this movie i am in big trouble this movie will go down in the <UNK> of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to
<START> a sadly inferior <UNK> to who's afraid of virginia <UNK> this film drags on and on occasionally <UNK> your interest only to put you through more and obvious but <UNK> overdone plot points br br it may list as <UNK> minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time
<START> on a clear day you can see forever is nothing more than a new age update of the <UNK> my fair lady story a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman this time however instead of using language skills the professor tries to do so by <UNK> and past life <UNK> br br you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music the songs are instantly forgettable no get me to the church on time here i'm afraid and the plot goes nowhere to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is no there here the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b professor claims several times that he will get to the root of <UNK> troubles but he never seems to do so br br all meaningful conflict is avoided for instance there comes a time when university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or <UNK> his position now there is conflict will he give up his career for daisy alas nothing comes of this development a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells to continue on with his work so much for conflict br br the talent was certainly assembled for this movie directed by <UNK> minnelli written in part by alan jay <UNK> a cast of <UNK> <UNK> bob <UNK> and jack nicholson and oh yes starring <UNK> who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career br br but it all falls flat attempt to <UNK> his greatest success the previously mentioned my fair lady is as doomed to failure as <UNK> attempt to revive the greatness of her own past br br if you enjoy movie musicals there are far better choices than this
<START> when i think of a 1970s period film this is not what i think of i don't want a monotonous one song robin soundtrack i want a soundtrack <UNK> with the top 40 <UNK> songs of the day that <UNK> the '70s the generic <UNK> style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying the acting if you can call it that was very wooden and seemed just read from script in <UNK> the film quality and camera work was horrid the dialog murky the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent i can't believe people are giving it the high ratings i've read here basically a forgettable poor attempt at <UNK> a beloved era of the past two stars is all i can come up with sorry guys
<START> based on a edgar rice <UNK> novel at the <UNK> core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest a victorian scientist dr <UNK> perry peter cushing <UNK> a giant <UNK> machine which he and his american partner doug <UNK> use to <UNK> their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold they soon discover a lost world of <UNK> creatures having conflict with <UNK> monsters br br cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying instead of being a bold <UNK> he comes across <UNK> on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> enough to make himself also laughable caroline <UNK> plays the pretty princess <UNK> that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth also in the cast are <UNK> james grant and michael <UNK>
<START> does exactly what you expect and then some the first movie was a step up from the tv show with <UNK> stunts airing <UNK> and a <UNK> factor that had <UNK> surprisingly jackass number two is even more twisted br br the stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular with some mind blowing painful antics <UNK> with good fun skits to keep that smile turning into a <UNK> of disgust br br <UNK> like always <UNK> the proceedings but this time he has reason to take centre stage as he <UNK> for the most dangerous and idiotic of all the stunts with <UNK> also proving himself as wild as ever despite having had his image toned down in <UNK> la surprisingly the infamous wild boys steve o and chris <UNK> seem to take part in fewer of the skits despite being <UNK> in the previous <UNK> br br if you like jackass or dirty <UNK> then you will definitely enjoy this film and will laugh your guts out for the 100 minutes of its duration if you see it as childish disgusting or a sad <UNK> of the youth culture of today you will find it as <UNK> as ever so f k off
<START> at last sandra <UNK> is indeed a beautiful woman but i've finally found a film that she gets to be an actress forget the predictable keanu fodder of speed forget the predictable <UNK> fodder of while you were sleeping this <UNK> her br br and she is great a <UNK> feminist role that really works well on screen on a subject that is very close to the bone the issues raised don't seem far fetched at all and the whole experience helped along by a fine supporting cast makes for quite an un couple of hours br br you may never enter another chat room again in fact i'm getting quite nervous just writing this review er bye
<START> if you have not heard of this film it follows two <UNK> from a <UNK> camp in africa to america where they convince themselves they will find success and <UNK> life is harder than expected in the states and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right the lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they're so perfect whether it be on the job at school or the time in between the two boys peter and are very honest with the filmmakers and make some very thought provoking comments about life in the states it's one of the only documentaries i can recall that when it ended i wanted it to go on for another two hours it might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn't get great distribution but check your local art house or independent theater and give this one a go side note if you're reading this when it's already on video then definitely it's worth a rent rating 28 40
<START> if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you're hoping for another <UNK> well look elsewhere it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the <UNK> i found the movie to be slightly entertaining boring for the most part the special effects aren't bad but it's nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the <UNK> tower <UNK> down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is apparently based on a french cult tv series <UNK> could have been so much better i voted this film a 4 10 only for the beautiful sophie she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking
<START> there's been a whole lot made about carlos <UNK> mr excuse me <UNK> of other <UNK> material heck even before joe had a <UNK> with him on stage i knew that carlos was <UNK> material from <UNK> and and a host of others br br to compound the crime of his <UNK> he <UNK> these comic geniuses jokes badly br br and that is a crime he continues to <UNK> on this show i'm sure the series writers have to share some of the blame it's got to be hard to write jokes day in and day out but that's why people get paid so <UNK> much to do it these series writers need to go back to their day jobs of flipping <UNK> or whatever it was they were doing before they decided to <UNK> upon a career of intellectual <UNK> br br not to say that he steals all of his material you can tell when he has <UNK> a joke on his own when what you are watching <UNK> the merely awful and goes straight into the territory of <UNK> bad br br because he likes to call people b h on his show ten year olds call him a genius they're gonna grow up one of these days carlos and when they do you're gonna dry up and blow away
<START> the big problem i had with this movie was that <UNK> character is as another user put it unnecessarily cruel lombard plays the role of ann smith who believes she is married to david smith played well by the <UNK> dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert <UNK> the movie has some funny moments especially when <UNK> character goes to great <UNK> to try to get his wife back understandably she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into it br br <UNK> character seems quite cold to her husband's sincere attempts to woo her back while not being highly <UNK> in that effort <UNK> is nevertheless <UNK> loving and yet lombard is as cool as a <UNK> of ice there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of <UNK> between the <UNK> couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy even dark comedy in that aspect to some extent the movie almost suggests a sadistic <UNK> with <UNK> character getting a kick out of her husband's feeble efforts while one might consider this another <UNK> of the type of movie the reality is that it is a highly battle if that <UNK> character while certainly flawed is not flawed enough to make it a typical <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an excellent example of that is michael douglas in <UNK> of the in fact the character is largely <UNK> as revealed by not only the sharp dress of <UNK> which probably owes largely to the <UNK> dressed actor himself but also to his <UNK> in attempting but failing to play the role of a <UNK> bachelor his only major flaw is his vanity but that fault does not balance out with his <UNK> excessive cruelty and there is no suggestion that she is trying to <UNK> any jealousy out of <UNK> love this is what makes it so cruel and sad <UNK> character simply looks weak in reality no wife would want a man so weak unless she wears the pants in the marriage but then again a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already <UNK> that role early on hence the whole theme seems weird this movie is neither a champion of <UNK> <UNK> character does show some signs of the sort of independent oriented woman of the 60s but that idea is soon <UNK> and the character falls back into the 1940s nor an even sided battle of the <UNK> as <UNK> character is truly a <UNK> of <UNK> and therefore a lost cause br br this movie is on the surface a slapstick but beneath that <UNK> it is really much darker with sadistic undertones all of which makes its resolution appear well odd maybe that <UNK> was the whole point in any case slapstick this movie is not
<START> every james bond movie has its own set of rules just like every indiana jones movie has its own set of rules and the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters with a completely unnecessary plot twist the integrity of both ocean films <UNK> somewhere between airplane 2 and a <UNK> cartoon br br imagine what would happen while <UNK> on the rope bridge outside of the temple of doom if <UNK> told <UNK> and willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety br br entertaining sure for a <UNK> cartoon but spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film more importantly it would have <UNK> the audience they'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of indiana jones movies and they were counting on indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way if he were to fly off people would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during <UNK> 12 br br spoilers br br 1 julia tess <UNK> a museum by <UNK> herself as julia roberts a clever twist by breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters is this the naked gun 33 and 1 3 it's a <UNK> example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film but wait just in case you haven't walked out yet br br 2 the suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie how will they pull off the heist there are only 10 8 5 2 days left and then in the last 12 minutes of the film the only entertaining part of this movie we see that the heist was made days earlier and took matt damon all of 30 seconds to pull off the past 10 days a complete waste of your time br br back to indiana jones on the rope bridge just relax willie i stole the real stones back about a month ago besides i convinced them you were kate <UNK> br br if you haven't already seen it cut your <UNK> and go see the polar express i don't want to ruin the ending for you but there really is a santa claus most importantly you won't feel cheated leaving the theater
<START> journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same <UNK> as earth and therefore has been <UNK> until a space <UNK> on the far side of the sun photographs it of course two <UNK> roy <UNK> ian <UNK> are sent to explore it but due to a <UNK> they crash find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey of course they're <UNK> at least <UNK> is <UNK> is <UNK> injured and <UNK> and asked why they turned back on their mission but it's claimed that they didn't until <UNK> seems to notice a few very odd things about being back home this is excellent if somewhat talky at times and the sets and feel aren't a far cry from thunderbirds territory but will live actors for once it's no big star wars type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit well worth seeing and it's criminal that the dvd is out of print 8 out of 10
<START> if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that <UNK> portrays a mute adds to her and <UNK> the suspense alec <UNK> appearance was nice but didn't really add to the movie i'm not sure if <UNK> <UNK> part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the <UNK> seen with the water in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment
<START> the box 2009 cameron diaz james <UNK> frank <UNK> james <UNK> holmes <UNK> sam oz stone <UNK> <UNK> truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend richard <UNK> sci fi <UNK> button button by on the <UNK> <UNK> filmmaker richard kelly who truly stretches a small well crafted piece into a grab bag a <UNK> mysterious and ridiculously <UNK> man <UNK> <UNK> a million dollar offer to couple diaz and <UNK> both surprisingly vanilla bland to the <UNK> a box with a red button that when pushed will kill some stranger in the world sure strings are attached but does that really matter here what does is why in the name of god does kelly <UNK> on so much <UNK> i e nose <UNK> <UNK> transport systems  that's right  <UNK> transport systems when the tension should be strung as <UNK> as possible oh the possibilities if this sounds like a bad twilight zone episode you are half right the '80s tv re boot actually did a decent small screen adaptation in fact rent that instead one of the year's worst films
<START> i have done a lot of international travel both on business and as a tourist for both types i assure you the best advice is also the oldest always drink the wine of the country in this movie the <UNK> michael comes to earth on business <UNK> it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little <UNK> boy does he drink the wine of the country br br could man be drunk forever with <UNK> love and fights br br he'd rise up of <UNK> and lie down of nights br br these are things you can't do in heaven so he enjoys them while he's here of course it turns out he had a couple of other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was about the first one he is just as successful the final scene is a little <UNK> but it is also wonderful jean <UNK> gets to dance with john travolta
<START> oh dear oh dear oh dear my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again painful story line painful characters and a painful two hours br br the best way of describing this movie is a follows i would rather stick <UNK> in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe br br advice is to stay well clear and let your local do you a favour of <UNK> this rubbish br br lin you told me this was good br br
<START> it's always a pleasure to see characters in a movie who are wholly good hearted and well <UNK> even when they're surrounded by those who are neither the film's moderately silly premise is that the conservative religious franklin family mother father teen boy and girl are involved in an accident <UNK> the parents and brother have a near death experience during which they meet jesus a pleasant but somewhat <UNK> soul who <UNK> from them the burden of sin ' when they return to their lives many of their views and attitudes have changed much to the <UNK> of the daughter who didn't share the experience the religious side is i think presented with a good balance from the good jesus to the <UNK> awful those of his who are obsessed with the sins of others and utterly oblivious to their own it's a movie to make you think give you a few good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world just might be a <UNK> place than you think it is
<START> spike <UNK> was one of the funniest men i've ever seen and a huge influence on my life br br this movie is limp and awful and does his memory no credit the script is <UNK> and <UNK> too many lines from the book intact the leg jokes here are incomprehensible the actors' performances are uniformly <UNK> a great cast wasted and the lead sean hughes delivers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> which misses the point completely br br the gentle pacing is a killer as well farce should <UNK> towards the end the <UNK> shows often did the novel definitely did but this film if anything slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax br br <UNK> narrated an <UNK> audio recording of in 1980 with t p <UNK> <UNK> kelly norma ronald and jack <UNK> now that's funny ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film i believe the <UNK> was transferred to cd but don't know if it's still in print br br there is a movie of <UNK> hitler my part in his downfall with jim <UNK> and arthur lowe it too is a <UNK> mess but it's funnier than this thing br br it's possible that <UNK> spirit is too <UNK> for the screen the other reviewers here are <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> thinking this film <UNK> virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint
<START> history teacher mrs <UNK> seems to have it in for student leigh ann watson who has her heart on achieving a writing school <UNK> she receives another low grade from <UNK> which doesn't help when one of her classmates luke steals the paper of the final history <UNK> and pops it in her bag mrs <UNK> finds it sticking out she threatens the three that she will go to the principal about it but he's not available so before she reports it the next morning leigh her friend jo <UNK> and scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not tell the principal however due to <UNK> that find themselves <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> to stop this getting out br br wasn't fan of it when i first saw it and after another viewing i'm still not one writer kevin <UNK> was on a roll after <UNK> the successful contemporary teen horror films <UNK> 1996 ' 'i know what you did last summer 1997 ' <UNK> 2 1997 ' and 'the <UNK> 1998 ' he was riding the success also not to forget the tv show creek but this project would be the final <UNK> the difference there compared with this entry was other then writing the screenplay he was also making his debut in directing the strange thing though was that i found his direction to be competently done but material he <UNK> up to <UNK> and tired it seemed to get caught in playing both a black comedy and straight out thriller without making it <UNK> the script is <UNK> with quick wit on going gags trivial stretches and <UNK> references towards other films but the problem is that it's too watered down with so many contrived developments and sappy moral <UNK> <UNK> the flow the <UNK> script had to be more strong and potent since it's a small scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly confined sets it tries to play mind games with the characters but these moments are there to only serve the story's poor progression into a <UNK> of stupidity and <UNK> the film's ending takes the cake <UNK> polished direction is sound but more so in a pedestrian way and therefore it lacks suspense and the pacing even with its taut surroundings can really <UNK> on you eventually feel it after the halfway mark and it shows up how minor the story is the performances are tolerable enough although if it weren't for helen <UNK> classy icy portrayal of manipulative <UNK> as mrs <UNK> and a <UNK> marisa we would have been stuck watching a vapid <UNK> to shoes katie holmes barry watson is modest in his <UNK> part and molly <UNK> has a lesser role the soundtrack packs enough energy but i found it terribly overwrought and <UNK> in its choices br br watchable but mechanical all round
<START> thank god i have fast forward i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls whatever it's a stupid cliché it doesn't make any difference there's this guy <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> buildings or something it doesn't matter he is handsome this <UNK> <UNK> who cares i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fast forward so who cares car <UNK> and handsome heroes who struggle back from them <UNK> like a melodrama to me <UNK> likes someone but he marries maria de instead she is <UNK> <UNK> beautiful with a heart shaped face then <UNK> has an <UNK> <UNK> with who <UNK> her beforehand for some reason you would think with her hand washed would be sexy no she is not this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who don't interest me <UNK> and maria have a <UNK> how boring this film is annoying i think this might be a minor theme of some spanish language movies the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds let me just clear this up this is a high class melodrama or perhaps soap opera it is not worth your time except for a laugh
<START> i've seen this movie n i can say that this is really a bad movie the director's gone nuts of course he does know a lot about the army but then he certainly is a cheap guy there are a <UNK> technical flaws in the movies as well br br okay here's my doubt in the end when they rescue the family including a girl who was just raped why do they leave them there outside their place i didn't see any <UNK> around there are a lot of aspects in the movie that are real but then i just wish the major had narrated helped <UNK> some other good director n made the movie br br <UNK> surely does deserve a better director
<START> <UNK> <UNK> massacre let me think high school girls get <UNK> up except the cute one survives got it next movie br br i was actually surprised this one was made in 2003 i really thought they quit making these movies in the 80's this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy dumb male horn dogs even dumber male adult and hot teacher it continues on the list of dark and <UNK> night and abandoned cabin in the woods we have seen it all before br br however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers so if you have got a few brain cells to <UNK> and 2 hours to kill you could do worse
<START> with all due respect to joel and <UNK> and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter jason king br br most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> detective in the <UNK> of austin powers but that will do a <UNK> to the character he's far more nuanced than that br br jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only <UNK> in at the end he is <UNK> his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is <UNK> without facts to back them up and he <UNK> whenever <UNK> is right and she often is he's clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives but jason king is brilliant if <UNK> had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his <UNK> love of <UNK> and prone to and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as <UNK> than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it br br watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth <UNK> put into jason king
<START> when uwe boll cinema con man <UNK> released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel hollywood's per <UNK> ratio of morons must indeed be high for not only do we have a sequel it was distributed in the <UNK> by <UNK> a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write offs released direct to television in america the sequel does improve on the original in most respects but in so doing it becomes bland rather than interesting the scale of the scenario is <UNK> with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can <UNK> the dead have been occurring in particular the action is spread throughout the university where the first infected <UNK> can be found put simply the film <UNK> from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be found br br the cast on the other hand is a real step <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was specifically made up to resemble a low rent angelina jolie while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> in fact the only name that will stand out among this cast is one <UNK> who probably did not want to be <UNK> that easily by the people he faces at home put simply these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen even under the best direction say what you will about boll but he at least inspired actors like <UNK> <UNK> to fight against his <UNK> that said the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was <UNK> some kind of misunderstood masterpiece and he took himself seriously unfortunately with the actors failing to take their characters or the <UNK> seriously what little dramatic tension there could have been is <UNK> br br much of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise or to translate into more practical terms they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans how this would help when a non mutated strain is usually required to create a <UNK> is anyone's guess but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own the we have to go back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time but the actual timing of the extra quest is also <UNK> we are told at one point that the town will be <UNK> by cruise <UNK> in ten minutes yet the heroes drive back into the university locate the <UNK> they are looking for and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china all in this space of time filmmakers take note it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than <UNK> dramatic tension br br the special effects used in house of the dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust where uwe boll <UNK> the deaths of the characters using idiotic <UNK> camera tricks michael <UNK> instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow <UNK> are bitten arms are cut off heads are shot it all makes for a much more convincing but it also <UNK> the mockery of obvious <UNK> the photography is also much improved as dvd crypt put it the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original but this also <UNK> us of something to have a laugh at the expense of the writing is also both an improvement and a <UNK> throughout the script references to other horror and survival horror games the most obvious being run like hell are offered the first couple of times they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary everyday dialogue after the <UNK> time however they just get on the nerves because they remind <UNK> of things they would prefer to do with their time br br interestingly house of the dead 2 cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america given that tom <UNK> on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results in contrast to the much <UNK> original the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly in a further contrast to the original the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing <UNK> the deal is the fact that apart from some real <UNK> scattered throughout the characters speak like real people however the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already when aliens the real dawn of the dead or the evil dead were released to acclaim the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before or did it so well that we did not really care house of the dead 2 is competent enough that we do not mock it but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table so we end up not caring either br br for that reason and many others i gave house of the dead 2 a two out of ten it is too good to be bad but too bad to be any good unless you are into <UNK> films as much as i am you are best to steer clear of it
<START> we picked this up as a part of a <UNK> set under the title the broken skull shot directly onto video with widely varying sound and lighting quality this movie winds up with a <UNK> quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of <UNK> confusion and <UNK> and not in a good evil dead kind of way br br without going into spoilers what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre while there are some interesting ideas here the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying <UNK> br br this is a very very gory movie the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head <UNK> to a silly video <UNK> effect that has to be freeze framed to be <UNK> believed the <UNK> level of gross out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore <UNK> while making anyone with a weak <UNK> feel a bit on the <UNK> side br br the broken skull is also an extremely <UNK> movie it features not only <UNK> noises captured by <UNK> and not replaced in post but there is a lot of <UNK> no no i mean a lot a lot a lot characters scream <UNK> <UNK> and yell and laugh <UNK> turn down the volume if you value your <UNK> and your nerves but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining in particular the actress playing a certain <UNK> immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto br br in fact very few of the actors were wooden some of them may have <UNK> a bit oh just a wee <UNK> but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off the cast is <UNK> diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that the two middle aged white women however are two of the most <UNK> <UNK> characters since the <UNK> in the mst3k classic the <UNK> man just watch them <UNK> at all the other characters it's fun br br in closing the may not become a horror icon on a par with jason <UNK> michael myers or freddy <UNK> or even the <UNK> but we can definitely say this this was a movie
<START> seems to me that joe <UNK> spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody he takes orders from a <UNK> faced angel of death who you might recognize as the <UNK> faced villain from tango cash and as the <UNK> faced cyborg from future war well joe and <UNK> have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb who questions led <UNK> well the car crashes and the chase is on the lucky kids to escape joe look like <UNK> and rick <UNK> they're chased around town break things and gets <UNK> at by her mom while she's <UNK> for a bath the action winds up at a hospital where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away in the end some green lights flash joe shouts and <UNK> <UNK> without a trace wish i could say the same for this movie watch it from the relative safety of <UNK>
<START> several years ago i saw this film without subtitles on television and despite me not understanding a word of what the characters were saying i still got the general idea and the mood of the film fascinated me no ends br br at long last i saw it again a few weeks ago my heart <UNK> when i saw the picture in the television guide and for 8 days until the film was really shown i told everybody i knew to go and see it the story reminded me a bit of alfred hitchcock's vertigo a slow brooding film about a guy who one day believes he sees the girlfriend that disappeared years before what follows is a wild <UNK> ride of flashbacks changing perspectives and really inventive twists in the plot and at the end of the film i was left breathless i had definitely not got what i had expected and i had actually already seen the film be prepared to be confused br br 9 out of 10
<START> this movie was produced by the biggest producer in <UNK> although their authors <UNK> about it as a the biggest movie in <UNK> ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil he he right well this is all a lie this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos <UNK> about a love triangle super cliché soap opera like subject and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of <UNK> with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil <UNK> on the region but at the end it never was <UNK> by the government now it may have some nice footage about the <UNK> but that's it nothing bigger than that it is all in the camera most of the actors are lousy except for two or three the rest lack of sense of what acting means they <UNK> most of the time the story is completely common and cliché worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil but 80 of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle the script is nothing <UNK> it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes but besides that is pretty decent the director did an alright job i mean he is not like an oliver stone but he did his job with the resources he had handy i would like to question him why instead of using actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones i mean after all they about being an 100 production that's what you at least expect final the end is is not well done there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless besides being the most <UNK> movie in all history i think it's mediocre you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash never heard of <UNK> anyway if you are curious about <UNK> <UNK> or central american movies this one will do but you are <UNK> not missing anything
<START> the distribution was good the subject could have been <UNK> and comic whereas he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving <UNK> instead of this the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy

<START> <UNK> travels is at the beginning a <UNK> novel written by a great <UNK> called jonathan swift so it is not recommended to judge of this movie just by itself we must go deeper into man's conscience to get to the point where swift would have lead us <UNK> has lived a voyage of <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> of what may be his true life we cannot just sit and watch that movie saying it is so <UNK> or so boring the matter is far beyond that and i would like everyone to expect that this is the greatest movie ever as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from ted character the unforgettable <UNK>
<START> i'm not going to lie and say i don't watch the show i do but it has a lot and a lot of flaws 1 the <UNK> school is perfect the drama is at a minimum everyone is so nice to each other you know lets give that a reality check its impossible that any school is perfect like free for everyone big <UNK> rooms mini <UNK> if there was a school like that in real life almost nobody there would be a virgin for one two everyone there is so rich and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet 2 characters really unrealistic first things first who in they're right minds talk like they do they talk like a perfect teenager would secondly logan reese matthew <UNK> is an extremely rich boy hot teenage boy my question is why isn't almost ever girl in that school all over him he's rich and hot now a days all those girls would be after him even if he was a jerk also chase is the most stupidest person ever he is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with <UNK> and over <UNK> to everything that involves <UNK> she must be blind not to see him in love with her br br come on nick i know you can do better than that please
<START> i love movies and rarely do i see a movie that i hate but this was the worst movie i have ever seen or at least close to it any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful hands down i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie i'm really mad i want my money back and my time back awful do not go to see it the cinematography is awful the plot is awful the ending is awful i didn't know what was going on during half the movie cause i could not see it and i was watching on a very nice and big tv rent saw the hills have eyes or house of wax any of those are better if u want something scary
<START> as i sit and think about poison for the <UNK> i realize that i may not being fair with the film my rating of 3 10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value based on the plot description reviews on imdb and the 7 6 imdb rating i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem sadly it just didn't do much for me for whatever reason poison for the <UNK> all but put me to sleep br br poison for the <UNK> is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city one of the girls <UNK> is a <UNK> liar and tells her friend that she <UNK> is a witch the other girl flavia is so <UNK> that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her that's really about it in reality nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as <UNK> attempts to <UNK> and dominate flavia one <UNK> on imdb described it as the scariest film in 80's mexican cinema my comment  if that's the case there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the 80s another <UNK> wrote watch it if you wanna get scared my comment  are you sure we're talking about the same movie my opinion is <UNK> opposed to these examples i've given to me it was dull uninspired and poorly acted the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos <UNK> doesn't ever show the faces of any of the other characters <UNK> and flavia carry on long drawn out conversations with members of their families and their teacher but we never actually see these <UNK> faces it's an annoying gimmick
<START> i'm guessing that the folks talking up this drivel are <UNK> of the director or something this is bad and not in the michael jackson song kind of way to compare the pacing of this movie to the progress of a <UNK> would be to insult the <UNK> this movie <UNK> along for what seems like an eternity all to introduce us to some un scary zombie kids with silly makeup and some sort of <UNK> or <UNK> for blood or whatever believe me you won't care the thought alone that mom would move her two daughters into this <UNK> and filthy home is absurd and worse i found myself simply not caring <UNK> about the zombie kids <UNK> of mom and or daughters don't care br br in short wow was this dull don't bother
<START> have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly <UNK> bag of great games if any further proof was required that they rule this genre of <UNK> then this is it before actually playing the game there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games fears were <UNK> that it was going to wear a bit thin br br play the game and see how quickly those fears are from the <UNK> video with in the boat to the closing stages in the <UNK> the jokes just keep on coming i was a great fan of the first two games and the other works day of the <UNK> sam max etc and this one does not fail to deliver the quality you will not be disappointed well i wasn't
<START> this is the funniest movie i have ever seen however i have laughed harder at plenty of movies this is because best in show's brilliance lies not in slapstick or one liners but in sophisticated and layered verbal wit the improvised dialogue is is so quick that you end up laughing not at each individual joke but only until after several jokes build on one another each <UNK> your senses until the jokes climax and you can't help letting loose br br it's a well shot film but what makes it extraordinary is the acting i was impressed on my first viewing but when i watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised i was amazed it was thoroughly enjoyable to see the comedians work off each other build jokes out of nothing and completely <UNK> themselves in their characters br br i imagine the golden days of second city were like this
<START> this movie actually hurts to watch not only did i not laugh once i ended up getting a serious headache at times i felt so sorry for the actors involved the best way to sum it up is to note that among sex comedies it is probably the least funny and least sexy of all time i'm only sorry i can't give it a vote of less than one to give this a rating of one is an insult to every movie that scores two or better br br now i see that they're filming a sequel hearing that someone is actually paying these people to make another movie convinces me that there's just too much money in hollywood raise their <UNK> making a sequel to this movie may very well <UNK> a crime against humanity perhaps an international <UNK> should be <UNK> or u n <UNK> applied to the filmmakers br br in short it's a really bad movie really really
<START> a fantastic musical starring gene kelly and rita hayworth he owns a nightclub where she dances she's no star yet but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for vanity whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother when he sees the resemblance he picks her right away for a contest his is running <UNK> <UNK> fame at first works wonders for kelly's club but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to <UNK> this isn't the most original of plots but the two leads really make it work it also helps that the screenplay is great kelly's not yet at his peak especially his peak as an actor his dancing however wow hayworth is the star but kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances <UNK> with his own reflection it's obviously a take off of fred <UNK> shadow dancing in swing time but i think kelly one ups it which is hardly believable in fact this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history save perhaps the finale of an american in paris several years later the rest of the songs are also excellent and the musical numbers are even better too bad rita didn't sing her own songs well she may have a couple of them as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes her dancing is wonderful as is the rest of her acting it's hard not to love her in anything she's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era not plastic like many of them no you can really see the warmth in that woman her smile is so <UNK> phil <UNK> has the role as kelly's best friend and he is also very funny the trio of kelly hayworth <UNK> is obviously the <UNK> which became the kelly reynolds <UNK> trio in <UNK> in the rain eight years afterwards one of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely <UNK> with the good morning number in <UNK> i do think <UNK> in the rain is the better film as cover girl is a little rough around the edges this <UNK> though just adds to the charm there are aspects of this film that beat <UNK> in the rain and even an american in paris for instance the central relationship is more emotionally involving instead of the <UNK> older man chasing the little girl leslie caron and debbie reynolds were just teenagers after all we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals there is no chasing around an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour you have to admit kelly and hayworth are a couple from the start and when that begins to <UNK> i really felt it 9 10
<START> i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made i sat down to watch it with this mindset and was pleasantly surprised br br it's not great it's not even that good in fact it's pretty poor however it's not as bad as i had been led to believe by a long shot it's pretty inept and evidently as a cost cutting measure a lot of stock footage is pressed into service a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative br br what it is however is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice before you <UNK> <UNK> or glenda out of hand examine your own artistic skills me i'd love to be able to draw but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men i'd love to be able to sing but all i do is <UNK> young children br br wood had an idea and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work however this was an incredibly daring movie for the <UNK> 50s however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance
<START> firstly i am a huge fan of crap films b grade is always good for a laugh unfortunately this film is just plain bad i dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film especially the big guy at the beginning it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with <UNK> br br the acting is so bad i need not comment on why the effect are also extremely amateurish with obvious blood <UNK> firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot br br it also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5 10 frankly it is <UNK> that people who worked on this film are <UNK> their own ratings br br i suggest everyone avoid this movie it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life br br absolutely awful
<START> i think this is one hell of a movie we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there's a message in it without the message it would be one of many action fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special
<START> being a huge fan of <UNK> http www imdb com title i was expecting to be <UNK> by another french beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor same director same actress what could go wrong unfortunately pauline a la is a huge disappointment it's very slow and <UNK> which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original but it comes across as a typical soap opera <UNK> between irrelevant <UNK> talk and jealous <UNK> the only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to pauline the source material is standard fare sexual awakening during a beach vacation but it could have been a decent film nevertheless if any of the characters were <UNK> interesting unfortunately that's not the case event though there are other shortcomings with <UNK> season cycle most of his later films are definitely <UNK> above this one
<START> a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s that's all they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty five maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching topics but i can't imagine that at that time anything shown in was regarded as br br shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even <UNK> the selection of songs doesn't involve anything but the very very well known that are still heard on every second radio station today the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny <UNK> is dull flat and not aesthetic almost unbelievable that it had six sequels
<START> i'm a <UNK> this movie is so wrong it hurts tried to watch with an open mind but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some <UNK> regarding history locations church <UNK> et <UNK> stop playing to the dumb audience please there are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature worthy of a theatrical release comes to town a little research all i'm asking but then again the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself so basically they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it i know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various <UNK> or just pay someone <UNK> a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself
<START> i saw this in a theatre back in 1982 i expected a stupid t a movie that's not what i got br br it's basically about three teenage boys trying to have sex we get the expected sex jokes and scenes but for once they're actually pretty funny br br yeah they're stupid but i enjoyed them anyways also there was a surprising amount of male nudity br br then the movie about halfway through takes a sudden dramatic turn as one of the boys <UNK> played by lawrence falls in love with a girl then the jokes stop and things get very dark i'm not going to give away what happens but i was very surprised at the sudden turn in events the movie brings up some very important subjects and treats them realistically and with intelligence and it has a real heart breaking ending br br i'm giving this a 10 because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedy dramas ever made it mixes fantasy and realism together and works what more can you ask for also it has a great soundtrack
<START> a superman cartoon br br a huge <UNK> of gold is being sent across country by train using ultra modern techniques a sophisticated gang of <UNK> thieves try to <UNK> the gold with <UNK> reporter lois lane as the only passenger on board it's superman to the rescue but now that it's become a runaway train can even he stop the billion dollar limited br br this was another in the series of excellent cartoons max <UNK> produced for paramount studio they feature great animation and taut fast moving plots meant to be shown in movie theaters they are miles ahead of their saturday morning counterparts
<START> before i review this film i must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that i've always been controversial in a low key sense giving high marks for <UNK> such as captain america and creature and <UNK> such film classics as <UNK> a christmas carol and shakespeare in love with that in mind this confession might not come as a surprise br br the simple fact is christopher <UNK> is probably one of my favorite actors <UNK> now don't start getting crazy on me just yet let me explain myself i by no means think he's the greatest actor in the world i clearly confess that he is not he is certainly no morgan freeman or anthony hopkins but i would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least bruce willis what i admire about him however are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes he is just an average guy who laughs and cries and <UNK> who is a hero because he has to be not necessarily because he wants to be it takes a lot in my opinion to be able to bring out those qualities in a character especially in the movies he's worked in and <UNK> heroes are a far cry from or <UNK> quite frankly <UNK> characters are easier for me to relate to hence he's not the greatest actor in the world he's just a personal favorite br br i can't say that same however for his films however much i his acting it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired most of them are quite frankly terrible and any <UNK> that he's gotten over the years from me isn't due to his acting but rather his bad choice in scripts br br with that in mind i can say that his debut film tarzan is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance as i mentioned it is effective of the he brings to the role and for how seriously the director writers and actors handle the material this is a far leap from the b movie action adventures with johnny from the 1940's in fact i would hesitate to call it an action movie instead it is a serious drama that takes all of e r <UNK> material seriously showing <UNK> quest to discover his real family in scotland after realizing that he doesn't fit in as a white ape he is torn in between his old family and his new one which includes a wonderful sir ralph richardson in his final role in an attempt to adapt to humans his ape instincts also kick in and he can't decide what he loves more his real family or the one that he's always known all in all it is a wonderful commentary on society and a wonderful character study br br if nothing else it launched <UNK> into international stardom which continued will into the 1980's with films like <UNK> and he <UNK> unfortunately it didn't last but just wait a while his latest career moves such as <UNK> and <UNK> have <UNK> that though he still have a long way to go he's a competent enough actor to be able to perhaps make a <UNK> comeback if he'll just pick his roles better br br for now however here's the verdict on his first film br br out of
<START> i come from <UNK> and here c c <UNK> is a <UNK> of awesome sex all kidding aside a friend and i were awake in the middle of the night watching movies on the <UNK> action channel when we came across a series of sci fi esquire flicks there was <UNK> 2 not bad not bad at all then judge <UNK> <UNK> almost ruins his career then a movie called lethal target one would think the title lethal target could only be awarded to a really cool and really cheesy rambo knock off but <UNK> what is delivered is what i would like to call a semi <UNK> semi pseudo action semi sci fi film actually i think i can say that this isn't even a film at all if it wasn't for the main character's sheer <UNK> my friend and i would've turned off the movie as the opening credits rolled br br i have a few questions to the people i wouldn't even dare say professionals who made this film one in the future why are they using the <UNK> we used in 1999 oh wait i get it it's all that they could get their hands on right well then why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday <UNK> shirt and a <UNK> kinda like what people wore in the late nineties oh i get it in space it must have been a fashion statement well then why oh why does the main character pull out a 3 5 <UNK> <UNK> at one point in the film so that she can some <UNK> wtf we've progressed so far that we have space travel but we still haven't progressed past 1 of space br br i guess i'm just asking for too much br br question two let's just say that yes this is a <UNK> porn then why is there only one real sex scene and why does it last for 2 minutes br br i mean you're taking the reason people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this crap dare i say <UNK> anymore and it down to 2 minutes hell they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie and they would've still made more money off of this crap than they did br br c c is hot and no offense to the actress but she acts about as well as i do and i'm mentally retarded and only have one <UNK> c c e mail me we'll have lunch i would write more but i've run out of space
<START> this is another one of those films that i remember staying up late to watch on tv <UNK> the crap out of myself at the <UNK> age of 12 or so and myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession this is a great movie and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before cgi br br set on an isolated base in <UNK> this version seems almost to pick up where the original version the thing from another world left off the american scientists discover a <UNK> norwegian base some miles distant everyone is dead and only the half <UNK> remains of some <UNK> thing left to <UNK> outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened the thing is brought back to the american base and too late the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal the thing <UNK> out and is off not only killing anyone and anything that crosses its path but also absorbing them making itself into whoever and whatever it wants the film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece everyone is suspect anyone can be the thing and no one <UNK> anyone anymore gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster the group <UNK> and fear rules supreme who is the thing br br the gore effects here are absolutely amazing and <UNK> realistic i could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana <UNK> but that's just the animal lover in me being <UNK> kill all the humans you want but leave the <UNK> and <UNK> alone sanity and reason <UNK> rapidly as one by one the humans are taken over by the <UNK> alien the power of this film lies in its paranoia and although i liked the original version i prefer this one the real threat lies within and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily <UNK> when it is forced out of hiding it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific br br this is one of <UNK> best films right up there with the fog and halloween all of the actors give strong realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character this film has something for any lover of the horror genre don't miss it
<START> i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some <UNK> because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out br br in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier 1969 and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously <UNK> and altman's work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are <UNK> identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character <UNK> out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior <UNK> <UNK> bad lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed <UNK> culminating in an operatic near death scene david <UNK> m <UNK> 1993 <UNK> brutal sex scenes david lynch's blue <UNK> 1986 and so on hence i am <UNK> by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely <UNK> such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher br br technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle <UNK> <UNK> performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of <UNK> films that i've seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of <UNK> an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 4 10
<START> if you want to see what could be <UNK> as the version of gypsy this is the film for you br br if you enjoy ed listing to the <UNK> recording of gypsy then you really enjoy watching midler as mother rose it's my opinion that midler has the volume <UNK> and presents that <UNK> once had br br it's not often these days when listening to update versions of musicals that i get that <UNK> sensation that makes the hair on my neck <UNK> but bette midler certainly shows her talents in this movie see how you like them <UNK> br br i know you may not like it but for me ms midler is the definitive gypsy
<START> after watching this movie i have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film for one as a general comment the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around the same obviously goes for the dialogue which <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines the acting was terrible as well with kane showing throughout the entire movie at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily <UNK> from its real life counterpart overall i would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature as it will most surely waste <UNK> not even 90 minutes of your life
<START> this movie serves up every imaginable greek stereotype in one particularly <UNK> scene the <UNK> says i'm just an ignorant <UNK> as the <UNK> of greek <UNK> immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and <UNK> i found this movie <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i gotta admit it i love horror films especially 80s slasher films hell i even love cheese like <UNK> camp and night of the demons but i didn't think much of this movie the death scenes weren't very well done the cgi was terrible and the acting was ho hum worst of all was the story which didn't make sense at all i'd say save your money but chances are if you want to see this movie you're going to anyway i didn't hate it it's just not very good overall it's just another bland lifeless horror film that lacks life it's no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed
<START> i did not quite get o  it is one of the <UNK> ones i have watched the soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by jean michel <UNK> it makes the movie <UNK> than it was i have to admit that i was almost going to change it and watch another one instead times the movie seemed plain dumb to me or boring  or confusing there are quite a few sexual references in that movie  <UNK> they too are kind of messed up probably the only phrase that i will remember out of it is going to be when you are alone you can control things  and i will show them or something like that the boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  the last summer as a child he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max so if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't
<START> this is a great show with total <UNK> and <UNK> that usual chair couch for a woman host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of probably the pattern of johnny carson copied by one and all leno conan <UNK> this show does not seem to have any of these br br i fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and i am going to stick to it though it's too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual <UNK> most talk shows try so hard to project and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest i hope that this show will last long br br returning back after months i still love this show and i love his self <UNK> humor for example his <UNK> that only <UNK> <UNK> would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual of conan o'brien for example i know it's a <UNK> sin to be <UNK> by <UNK> antics but i do really dislike his style and <UNK> br br i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it spoof of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in an earlier episode are hilarious idiot <UNK> are fun especially when a security guard <UNK> them against taking people's pictures and if i am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting gary coleman br br added on <UNK> april 2007 coming back once again i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing either way it was funny as hell br br i do not expect spike to read these pages but maybe he does he is <UNK> than a bunch of monkeys and so i would better write down my suggestion here for him i would like him to do a full 30 minute show with crazy <UNK> the star of late night tv commercial i would like crazy <UNK> to have an interview in <UNK> talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of snl and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential of los angeles i know crazy <UNK> may not be aware of this but there are <UNK> <UNK> why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la br br god willing br br returning back on <UNK> july 2007 someone wrote here that the people who praised <UNK> <UNK> must be <UNK> by spike i confess that spike really <UNK> me but i must also confess that <UNK> named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy
<START> i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago when i first saw the killing of a chinese <UNK> in a berlin cinema which i found interesting to put it but not so special i instantly wanted to see more of his work since then i tried with an emphasis on tried watching his other work shadows in particular i must admit it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film at first the <UNK> raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original absolutely but flawed and dated experiment but now upon reviewing these little <UNK> make it look so fresh even today br br shot on a minimal budget of 40 000 with a <UNK> six person crew shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african american family in which two of the three siblings ben ben <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are light skinned and able to pass for white cassavetes <UNK> that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and <UNK> editing a reaction against hollywood production values cassavetes main inspiration at least in the cinematic style the film was shot were the italian neo <UNK> whilst also <UNK> admiration for welles' <UNK> spirit the use of amateurs and <UNK> might resemble some of the italian neo <UNK> directors but with his <UNK> score by charles <UNK> <UNK> the film feels very different very american unlike anything made before really br br the song with the <UNK> girls i feel like a <UNK> pop or something feels like light years back to me ancient history but no matter how dated it might look it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today i think it's this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film without hollywood improvised and without a real budget seymour <UNK> who acted and was involved in shadows claims it was jules <UNK> the naked city 1948 that was the first and inspired them all but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers br br camera <UNK> 8 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was a symbol of in the of 50 s he play a role of russian leader in <UNK> at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the <UNK> br br the script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from <UNK> to england br br the best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the hungarian resistance to kill the russian major <UNK> <UNK> in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the <UNK> of this major from his bad works but at the end he made a good work to help deborah kerr for escaping her and her darling to london to write in his book a good working to gain at the end people s <UNK> and after his assassination by the hungarian resistance
<START> i think a several of america's baseball movies are among the best movies ever made when this movie was in production and heard it described as a <UNK> movie i'd read about the <UNK> team in the <UNK> but didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me br br last night i viewed it on demand and loved it almost as much as my favorite baseball movies ryan little and the cast and crew did an amazing job neil <UNK> was especially convincing as the bad dad he displayed fine range and a subtle but moving character arc br br i also enjoyed the pacific <UNK> actors i've been fortunate to know many of these fine people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture a flashback showing how the <UNK> culture became such a key element of team would have been a excellent addition to the film br br some pretty tacky movies have been shot in <UNK> recently it's good to see a quality film like this from the <UNK> state
<START> some weeks ago at a movie theater i saw a movie poster of el <UNK> 2004 with the tag the latin godfather how lame have we become i thought latin just because he is a mexican let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to italy so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why we are called latin american people because we speak spanish a language based in the latin language that <UNK> in rome now italy so to place a tag in a movie poster like the latin godfather is not just ignorant of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather but a desperate and <UNK> attempt to get some credit by <UNK> the title of a movie classic now about the movie i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most
<START> i swear i didn't mean to i picked this out only since it looked good on the back this movie wasn't scary at all and actually was very confusing the demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty <UNK> the one major bright spot was seeing <UNK> from <UNK> play in it seeing what happened to her however made up my mind for this little turkey of a film a 3 out of 10 next
<START> it's a shame there's an interesting idea here but it gets completely lost in a confusion of <UNK> 64 style computer effects and bad storytelling the plot such as it is concerns a bounty hunter of souls it should be a fairly straightforward hunter hunted kind of story but the director and or the writer seem like they forgot what the movie was supposed to be when they were about three days into shooting things aren't helped by the fact that the main baddie looks like he's wearing a cheap darth <UNK> mask which they tried to disguise with flowing cg colors not much to recommend here even the title seems to <UNK> it into obscurity
<START> i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie <UNK> his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy another thing i didn't really like is when a character got <UNK> in the face a <UNK> of blood would <UNK> forth soon after i don't know how folks bleed over there in japan but i hope they have plenty of blood <UNK>
<START> i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story one did however have to suspend ones <UNK> on a number of occasions for the plot to work for example despite losing their transfer cable <UNK> and <UNK> when the pilot <UNK> the <UNK> they fortunately found a spare on board the aircraft complete with <UNK> according to the plot <UNK> a hole in the ceiling of the vault would <UNK> the alarm system in the vault when the system was <UNK> i can't think why according to there <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would be unable to <UNK> through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a <UNK> <UNK> complete with <UNK> and to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes <UNK> system located above the vault as the plane has a closed <UNK> system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting <UNK> pressure <UNK> in the <UNK> accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to <UNK> a small hole through the top of the vault tension will they be able to <UNK> through before <UNK> get there to check the false alarm yet from the time the vault door closed and before the <UNK> had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a <UNK> hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through one can accept all <UNK> and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending they killed off the two hero's if one can refer to <UNK> as hero's brooks one was shot and thrown out of a <UNK> at 10 000 feet the other <UNK> down the cable between the two planes the villain with one hand manages to the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour <UNK> on him and letting him fall to his death and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation however <UNK> or implausible have miraculously survived the full from 10 000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate <UNK> to get the money the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot don't expect an oscar nomination for this one
<START> it is a shame that such a great book was turned into such a terrible movie i could not wait to see this movie after reading the book it really did not do it justice
<START> movies like this make me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had mercifully for movie fans put an end to m night <UNK> inside the <UNK> this garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame random uninspired last minute generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like the sixth sense and the others were released this was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written and decided hey here's an interesting idea lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer that'll throw the audience for a loop what an original idea
<START> many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie my movie will always be john carpenter's the thing the main reason why this movie is a cult film is perhaps the splatter effects created mainly by genius rob <UNK> and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today along with escape from n y in my opinion this is not a great film because of the effects it has to do with the story the atmosphere and of course the acting i have watched thousands and thousands of movies 3 6 every day the last 10 years but none has had the impact on me as this one not even the great <UNK> boot br br here's my suggestion to you who likes sci fi and horror movies place yourself in the good chair of your home be sure you're not by anyone if you <UNK> got a <UNK> sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film let it you and you'll see it my way br br best view time late <UNK> between 5 and 9 in the evening
<START> this movie is funny and sad enough i think that it is kinda true if you love office space then you will love this movie because it is another mike judge hit but it is nothing like office space i told every one to see this movie i only wish that it would have been in more theaters so it would have gotten the recognition it deserved i love this movie and would love to see more from mike judge luke wilson is also what makes this movie what it is i am so glad that i will not be alive in the year because if this movie turns out to be true we are all in for a lot of trouble i just hope more people see this movie because i know that they will fall in love with it too
<START> i would just like to point out in addition to <UNK> for the series to be released on dvd that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining these days with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas reality shows etc it's nice to get lost in a good cheesy show with entertaining characters fits the bill was it emmy material no but it was awesome just the same br br i also have to put a vote in for the second cast they were more charismatic than the cast of season one i would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two but i was definitely more sucked in by the latter cast even though the series has been off the air for years i'll never stop hoping that it be released for purchase
<START> on the pure theatrical side last stand was great as the <UNK> and soundtrack are very entertaining but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that while not as long or as flashy are far more historically <UNK> br br certain little details such as the <UNK> of the word for the greek <UNK> shield and the of various names and words really ate at me br br my guess would be that because last stand of the 300 was aired the eve of the theatrical release of 300 the history channel was only trying to ride the <UNK> of the movie's hype br br if you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible you'd have better luck elsewhere
<START> i thought that the storyline came into place very well i liked this movie a lot if you're going to <UNK> on a bridget fonda movie you can just <UNK> i thought that <UNK> on movie stars was a bad idea apparently somebody doesn't think so i rather enjoyed the movie i'm even thinking of buying it i want it to be my very first dvd for my room that's how much i like it i rather would not start an online argument with someone i don't know have it be over a movie if someone could kindly <UNK> what they said about the storyline i would be more than happy to <UNK> my insult however if they feel that i am not worthy of a i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either but i can't control their actions i can only encourage them in the right direction hey they don't have to make a but i would greatly appreciate it
<START> anyone who has ever gone on an audition can certainly relate to this one great story of an aspiring actor and the <UNK> he must deal with both personally and <UNK> in order to make it to the big time lou myers as half step wilson provides many hilarious moments
<START> this show is non stop hilarity the first joke will make u wet your pants and thats probably the weakest joke of them all i started watching it when the second half of season 2 started airing and straight away i'm hooked only 2 weeks after i started watching i've <UNK> episodes and bought the dvd's <UNK> clips such as the ad road test and current affairs are quiet hilarious then there's the they take off use <UNK> use your own tears for more effective use also funny in the politics side of things nothing is wrong with them doing this it's funny any <UNK> who don't find this funny don't complain and don't watch it all australian tune in <UNK> at 9 on abc
