<START> dead man's bounty the film's american title has the look and feel of a classic italian western the cinematography costumes and sets look great the cast is rugged not a pretty face among them at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster br br the script was perfectly dreadful there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama br br despite looking great the cast spoke english with heavy european accents that were often <UNK> br br the final nail in it's coffin was the broad streak of <UNK> that paints most of the picture focusing heavily on the character of the <UNK> who's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes also her speech near the end was pretty <UNK> br br the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man continuing his recent string of <UNK> performances
<START> on the surface appears to be yet another generic high school drama but surprisingly hidden away underneath is immense amounts of depth originality and <UNK> that will not only render it unforgettable to the viewer but also makes it <UNK> one of the best <UNK> that the medium has produced in the last few years br br we see the world through the eyes of who on his first day of high school meets a girl that <UNK> claims to the rest of the class she has no interest in <UNK> <UNK> and to top it off casually invites any aliens time <UNK> <UNK> or to meet up with her stares in disbelief wondering if <UNK> joking or has a few <UNK> loose however <UNK> his gut instincts he begins talking to her in doing so it soon becomes apparent she isn't some ordinary high <UNK> not to long after she creates her own <UNK> named school club and drags amongst other highly unfortunate people to attend br br nothing in this anime <UNK> to the usual standard conventions the protagonist is an overly cynical <UNK> and contributes a witty narration to the show a far cry from the usual <UNK> male leading characters that tends to <UNK> the medium the episodes themselves are not <UNK> and forces the viewer to think about the events unfolding and how they relate to prior instances this is a stroke of genius the effect is like a <UNK> saw puzzle as a new piece is <UNK> we get more of a sense of the bigger picture previous scenes are now given entire new meanings and the realization of them are profoundly satisfying this does mean however that it feels <UNK> <UNK> its anything but a very cleverly written script has <UNK> this problem and <UNK> that it flows smoothly from start to finish br br the story itself is strikingly original but i won't delve further than the simple bare bones plot outline i gave earlier as it will no doubt spoil it for you however what i will mention is the plot <UNK> a vast array of genres ranging from comedy to sci fi how they managed to accomplish this in the space of <UNK> episodes is beyond me and no doubt a huge achievement in itself br br is a true gem which has such diversity and depth that it will appeal to pretty much anyone with an interest in anime watch it rather unusually this is something that lives up to the enormous hype that it has received and even <UNK> it
<START> bottom at its absolute highest perfection who ever says slap stick comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong not that this film will only appeal to those who are of a <UNK> nature this is another quality british dark comedy with many many jokes not violence related but it helps if you can let your senses go and laugh at the sheer stupidity of it all br br this is a true example of <UNK> british <UNK> and <UNK> talent hats off to them on a performance level it reminds me very much of the early works of the marx brothers where the same level of enthusiasm and devotion are present in their acting styles resulting in a performance where the audience can really engage the <UNK> human desire to see others suffer yet to be detached and still feel safe much like the principle many tv chat shows operate on a truly marvelous bit of manipulation leaving all parties feeling better off
<START> okay i'll say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and <UNK> i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary <UNK> on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me br br for example anne to her troubled husband what makes you <UNK> so heavily darling br br if that <UNK> of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2
<START> hi <UNK> br br i bought this on dvd from england you see i have one of those multi region players i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends well surprise to amy jo johnson she's barely in the movie although she is on the cover it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place perhaps someone has a trust <UNK> br br oh it's about vampires who live at the beach
<START> this is a very long movie indeed but it is quite beautiful and a good example to show why cinema can be considered art a story easily told cannot be expected in les <UNK> but every scene every silence here tells much more than a hundred dialogs touching different perfect in its pictures and soundtrack showing why the close brought by the cinema as one of its main features became the greatest <UNK> in any dramatic representation someone who is used to that kind of movies where everything is told and action takes place all the time will find this <UNK> but it is worth watching to find out other possibilities of feeling a story
<START> is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and <UNK> it lacks originality if you have seen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from there is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in <UNK> <UNK> br br still it is a good movie because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches the opening sequence to begin with is quite impressive we meet nick aaron dallas and billy hill james le they get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop we've already <UNK> at a <UNK> with a lot of money in it br br then we meet <UNK> thomas jane in <UNK> he is married to christine paula marshall but used to be working with nick she doesn't know a thing then nick gives him a call and says that he is coming we learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to start br br what happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters all interested in the money or the drugs nick also had with him <UNK> has <UNK> those down the drain br br very funny moments a lot of blood a very funny sub plot involving actor michael <UNK> and some surprises although if you really think about it you see them coming this is a good movie with some very fine performances nicely directed by skip woods
<START> i don't think i have ever seen a better movie parody mel brooks is insane every time i watch it i find something new and it makes it even more funny than the time before cary <UNK> is perfect for the role of robin hood it has a great and unexpected ending that leaves you cracking up every character is great from little john and will to maid <UNK> and i laughed the whole way through and will never get tired of it watch it br br if you liked cary <UNK> in this movie you must definitely see the princess bride
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> is the kind of film that makes you realize that the drama of life is hidden in the details and that drama can be great fun too even though your own love life and your own friends may not be as unique as the characters in this movie every one is bound to recognize themselves and others in the colorful protagonists of this film and that's the great strength of <UNK> and <UNK> that the irony of life is that the most confusing things that happen to you can be the most interesting hilarious funny sexy things too hope you'll enjoy the film as much as i have
<START> what an uninteresting <UNK> <UNK> it could have been something more but no imagination seems to have gone into the script or the direction a man is framed for murder by his wife and her lover the <UNK> do a pretty <UNK> job of making him look guilty but the man richard thomas whose psychiatric records reveal him as stable and unimaginative manages to escape from jail beat it to the beach house and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt then he accidentally drops the tape <UNK> with all the evidence on it into the sea water but manages to retrieve it he shows a heck of a lot of creativity and <UNK> skill for an unimaginative guy if you ask me br br the tape is now damaged goods but it's enough to break down the wife's lover and he <UNK> out his confession bad people are <UNK> good people are saved br br the location shooting is impressive the beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior thrown up on the grounds of <UNK> fisher battlefield on the cape fear <UNK> the house was torn down immediately after the production wrapped br br it's a pretty place unfortunately it's a little hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of <UNK> stretched over the camera lens it's all very fuzzy and for all the natural <UNK> of the location the viewer never gets a real sense of place of what the sand feels like of the <UNK> of the gray <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting is okay but the performers have nothing much to work with the best performance as is often the case is given by dick olsen as a sleazy but not unsympathetic defense lawyer virginia madsen <UNK> infidelity with every beat of her <UNK> ted <UNK> is within his range as an <UNK> <UNK> br br the musical score neatly <UNK> the ominous with the mysterious and is effective if you want to hear the original from which this was ripped off rent hitchcock's vertigo and listen to bernard <UNK> suspenseful theme br br i can't think of any particular reason to catch this one except utter boredom
<START> for all its many flaws i'm inclined to be <UNK> towards thing there is the <UNK> of an interesting creepy claustrophobic hitchcock style story here put this in the hands of a writer like theodore <UNK> or if you prefer british perspective robert <UNK> or the guy who wrote day of the <UNK> and you might have had a nasty unsettling little <UNK> story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories br br however someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap 2nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted a story like this really needs a voice like to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light his classic story the the and is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of ordinary characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met a good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader see some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to <UNK> his emotions br br instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are <UNK> together and made to interact in unconvincing where did that come from moments that just lie there ie the blond psychic girl <UNK> that you're all evil and i hope you are destroyed we get <UNK> pacing and slow motion <UNK> and dull sets and stiff actors i blame the director for the and part these are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also <UNK> actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them we get <UNK> for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff if i'm going to have my <UNK> instincts exploited and feel guilty about it i want done by stuff staged better than this and we get over an hour of creepy build up <UNK> in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti <UNK> i've ever seen br br good things about thing um well some of the <UNK> shots of the head <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> were pretty effective the <UNK> and <UNK> widow <UNK> true to life even if i wanted to stuff a <UNK> in her mouth the first scene where the big simple ranch hand <UNK> turns on the <UNK> cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character and like i said earlier the idea of an <UNK> force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance br br which this definitely is br br but as i said i'm inclined to be <UNK> because the director was probably working under a budget <UNK> time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money heaven knows how future generations will judge <UNK> crap like the cave wrong turn or the remake of house of wax 40 years from now i hope they are <UNK> towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock
<START> having just watched i find that i have to agree with the negative reviews here i like asian and korean horror and i had great expectations for this film man was i disappointed watching this i kept thinking surely they just do this to catch me off guard later on and for a while i expected something ingenious to happen however i slowly realised that the film really is that bad it is the <UNK> cash in into the asian horror market i have seen so far br br the basic story is perhaps not even that bad but the way it is filmed it seems like the most laughable plot ever the tree as a <UNK> device might be okay if used cleverly but all the filmmaker does is giving us different shots of yes a tree over and over again he seems to hope that the tree will do all the work for him in terms of tension and build up but it just feels like what it is shots of a tree for <UNK> sake br br slow build ups can be very effective and a film that presents the viewer with only few glimpses of what is wrong might deliver good scares but not sure we get a glimpse of a child on a disappearing around a corner and yet again meaningful shots of the tree from above or underneath or the side but these scenes are just not scary they feel silly especially because you realise that the director means them to be scary they simply aren't br br apart from that i agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are ridiculous in particular the one character's into <UNK> is laughable however what really breaks is the terrible editing its hard to see why scenes were cut together the way they are but it's bad and it kills any spark of it might have had it also makes me feel <UNK> because i can see what they are trying to achieve with it but i cannot believe that they think i would fall for such cheap <UNK> br br there are lots of great asian ghost films and lots of bad ones but this is by far the worst i have seen they must have been going through the list of <UNK> to put into ghost <UNK> and <UNK> them all off but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie
<START> the problem with so many people watching this movie is the mindset they watch it in people come looking for a b grade horror film or a so bad it's good movie jack frost 2 is neither of these br br it is to put it simply a very good movie cleverly hidden inside a very bad one to view it as anything other than a screwball comedy easily funnier than all three absolutely scary movies combined is to the movie on a basic level it would be like watching <UNK> redemption and then complaining that there were no explosions br br the premise is simple the characters from the first movie haunted by memories of jack frost take a vacation to a <UNK> island a new improved jack comes after them now with essentially the powers of <UNK> man from spider man essentially he can turn from water to snow easily and quickly <UNK> himself <UNK> himself and worst of all he's managed to grow an <UNK> to his only former weakness <UNK> br br what's sad about this movie is that the brain dead fans of the first jack frost a simply horrible movie can't appreciate the change of tone for the sequel just as alien was a horror film and aliens was all about action jack frost was a weak attempt at gimmick horror and jack frost 2 is a cleverly written parody of the gimmick horror genre br br most of the entertainment comes the live action actors who serve admirably particularly funny among them are ray playing a caricature of a retired british colonel from the early <UNK> christopher <UNK> offering an insane hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film and david allen brooks taking the once serious role of manners to new totally bizarre heights br br the lack of memorable quotes <UNK> me br br as a horror movie jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman rates a zero but you have to understand it's not a horror movie
<START> this film was so <UNK> rambling and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing i actually thought some interesting plot elements might develop this was nothing more than a coming of age film for the thirty something generation total crap and i have no idea what <UNK> moore was doing in this since it was the only reason i picked it off the shelf at the rental store
<START> this is one of the classic twilight zone episodes where with the <UNK> of situations the viewer was drawn into a seemingly symbolic conflict only to find the solution surprising and strangely acceptable five figures are inside a <UNK> prison a major a <UNK> a a clown and a tramp they are certainly an odd choice of types to be in this isolation chamber but they are all in it nevertheless and they are trying to figure out why they are there what have they in common none can figure it out but gradually the major <UNK> them into working to bet out by standing on each other's shoulders and the major going to the top of the line of figures does reach the entrance and i'll leave it like that although one of the other <UNK> on this thread actually gives the story away br br the title seems to be suggested by six characters in search of an author famous play whether the actual purpose to the show was to spoof that play is questionable characters analyze their roles and relations with each other but the five characters here while they try to understand their situation are totally in the dark they are not in the situation of the six characters in who know their current situations this <UNK> of what is going on allows the viewers to think it is an abstract drama br br the actors william as the major and murray as the clown in particular give good accounts of themselves and the conclusion whether planned as a spoof or not is quite effective
<START> once the slow beginning gets <UNK> the film kicks off and really becomes quite a lot of fun in many unexpected ways the ensemble cast is really good with heather graham perhaps being the weakest of them <UNK> affleck as her brother is really good and extremely likeable if you catch my drift br br i highly recommend the film if you just want to have to good hours teenagers should really enjoy this film it says a lot about relationships
<START> of all of the post 1985 perry mason movies i have seen this one is my least favorite br br i confess i have never liked diana <UNK> as an actress she only seems to know how to play one type of character a hard bitten career woman with some <UNK> chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with this one is no exception it runs true to form br br the only thing that saves this movie in my opinion is an earnest performance by scott <UNK> as the <UNK> i actually found myself rooting for him to win and the movie is worth seeing for him alone
<START> in following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material the thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time john carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things or maybe very <UNK> who knows bringing forth incredibly wretched brilliant <UNK> and <UNK> by rob with stan winston also on the team these effects help set the tone against the harsh detached environment carpenter sets up with his characters the film takes the story of a group <UNK> in a research <UNK> in the middle of an <UNK> climate <UNK> against a <UNK> force that takes the <UNK> of others it's given a full life by carpenter's choice of tones and surprises for someone following in the footsteps of howard <UNK> the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in <UNK> the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film br br with the effects people working to full force amid what would likely follow as containing the most fire per scene it could become <UNK> but it all fits into the suspense after a while the actors pull along as a fine ensemble unlike the squad in predator these are mostly just regular working guys with the leader coming in the from of kurt <UNK> very good role for his style excellent in fact <UNK> supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of <UNK> <UNK> and keith david and it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory demented <UNK> form is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone i loved the long <UNK> at times with <UNK> <UNK> spooky curious music in the background and that bass line is of merit in itself br br it ranks up with being if nothing else delivering what it <UNK> for for its genre cult audience it remains one of carpenter's best a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera dialog and timing with the scenes that's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence it is and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny but given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by gone era the creatures make up alongside the steady well <UNK> script was done completely without cgi it's disgusting but it's real and atmospheric to a t
<START> okay so this series kind of takes the route of <UNK> we go again ' week in week out david character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a <UNK> but what's wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in a series created by david a great writer is heaven br br due to the lack of love for this show by many i can't see it going to a season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that <UNK> me let's hope something good can make it past a first series
<START> in a style reminiscent of the best of david lean this romantic love story <UNK> across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert <UNK> against which it is set it's a film which <UNK> that one does not choose love but rather that it's love that does the choosing regardless of who where or when and furthermore that it's a matter of the heart often <UNK> upon <UNK> conditions and circumstances and thus is the situation in the english patient ' directed by anthony the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most <UNK> of places and times proving that when it is <UNK> love will find a way br br it's wwii flying above the african desert hungarian count de ralph <UNK> is shot down his <UNK> mistaken for an enemy aircraft and though he survives the crash he is severely burned to his great good fortune however he is rescued by a tribe of <UNK> and winds up in a hospital but existing conditions are <UNK> by circumstances of war and soon becomes one of many patients being transported via <UNK> to a different facility upon reaching italy he is too weak and ill to continue on and a canadian nurse <UNK> juliette <UNK> <UNK> to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery br br <UNK> soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery as remembers nothing of his past and not even his own name thought to be english the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash but even they are as <UNK> as patient slowly however under <UNK> from <UNK> begins to remember bits and pieces of his life and his story begins to unfold and his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named <UNK> willem dafoe who suspects that is the man he's been looking for a man with whom he wants to settle a score but burned beyond recognition may or may not be that man meanwhile memories continue to surface memories of a woman he loved <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas as well as memories of husband geoffrey colin <UNK> and crippled in mind and body as he is those memories become the only thing left to which he can <UNK> with any hope at all even as his life seems to be <UNK> <UNK> away with each passing moment br br in addition to directing anthony also wrote the screenplay for this film which he adapted from the novel by michael the result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of <UNK> doctor <UNK> and lawrence of <UNK> a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with <UNK> <UNK> and beauty simply put film is genius realized crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection watching it is like watching a <UNK> come to life from the opening frames casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is <UNK> and <UNK> with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the <UNK> stunning and vibrant images brought to life by john remarkable cinematography images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer in every sense this is a film of rare <UNK> with a striking emotional capacity that <UNK> an experience that is truly <UNK> nominated in twelve categories it deservedly received a total of nine oscars including best picture director supporting actress <UNK> and cinematography br br if one had to choose a single word to describe the of this film it would be excellence ' even an extraordinary film however does not receive nine oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind and the performances given by ralph <UNK> and <UNK> scott thomas here <UNK> the term oscar worthy ' nominated for best actor for his portrayal of geoffrey rush was awarded the gold for <UNK> has never been better achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly <UNK> private and <UNK> is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection <UNK> however finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in enough so that you taste the honest passion <UNK> up within him and it works does not seek your friendship he will however gain your compassion br br <UNK> scott thomas too received an oscar nomination for best actress frances received the award for for her portrayal of <UNK> a woman whose stoic <UNK> masks the emotional conflict raging within her born of the forbidden passion that <UNK> her and yet to which she gives herself willingly casting off her <UNK> of <UNK> to embrace a love so strong it threatens to <UNK> her the <UNK> <UNK> must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience as scott thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect it's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast taking you as it does beyond that curtain of <UNK> that <UNK> what must be if only for the sake of appearances and allows you to experience a true sense of <UNK> passion understated and <UNK> with subtlety it's terrific work by <UNK> scott thomas br br <UNK> gives a stunning affecting performance as well as the <UNK> nurse <UNK> it is her humanity in fact which <UNK> love in it's <UNK> sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film her relationship with <UNK> andrews <UNK> us a glimpse of passion of another kind which <UNK> effectively with the intensity of that between and <UNK> the english <UNK>

<START> others have commented on the somewhat strange video <UNK> i think they were trying to capture what you'd be looking at when attending a live performance the feet the faces the overall view unfortunately it falls a bit short but having said that watching colin dunne is nevertheless <UNK> it's an interesting contrast to michael <UNK> in the original video the progression of the show is evident changes from the original <UNK> production are evident br br <UNK> <UNK> is the highlight of the video in my opinion winston is unbelievable as is his partner in the piece br br i think the audio was better in this version than the original video production 1995 in <UNK> 5 1 on dvd it's excellent br br despite the flawed it's a must own for <UNK> fans
<START> in new york in a morning close to christmas an upper class father and mother go in their <UNK> to a private school to see the play of their daughter then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan in the night they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood where they prepare drugs for distribution on the christmas eve while buying the christmas gift for their daughter the father is kidnapped and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the <UNK> <UNK> r <UNK> is a <UNK> movie of <UNK> <UNK> the lead characters do not have names are anonymous and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons or that there are many dirty cops probably worse than the criminals or is it a simple <UNK> to crime whatever however this <UNK> of criminals is a horrible message and i really did not like this movie in brazil for example many drug dealers and criminals help their <UNK> due to the absence of the state in poor areas and <UNK> but this <UNK> does not make them model citizen in this movie we see a loving upper class family in the day providing drugs as means of living but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters in the end i wished all of them dead my vote is four br br title brazil do gangs of the ghetto
<START> i have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks i didn't rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick the next great horror spoof or the next great low budget horror spoof obviously this isn't meant to scare but one fatal flaw with the production entirely <UNK> the joy out of the viewing experience the sound editing was horrible i had to work the volume control the entire movie you can imagine how difficult it is to get into something even a low budget spoof when you're either turning the volume up or down or trying to <UNK> the next time you have to do so the regular dialogue is very low and all screams noises etc are very loud we're not talking about between 5 and 7 on the volume control finding a happy medium at 6 we're talking between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone again this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be but you're going to be spending so much time <UNK> your volume control that you'll never have the chance to enjoy it
<START> slick <UNK> and well made old school version of how a great international thriller should be made determined to nail a feared global terrorist who is known as carlos the jack shaw donald sutherland without limits space <UNK> a cia <UNK> and his israeli counterpart <UNK> ben kingsley gandhi sexy beast get a noble naval officer <UNK> <UNK> quinn music of the heart to become carlos and use him in a daring plot to get the <UNK> to kill the real carlos because he took an offer from the cia sutherland and kingsley are both good here but the movie really belongs to quinn here who <UNK> himself here in a <UNK> role director christian <UNK> and cinematographer david franco provide another great asset of the film here with <UNK> like suspense and great sights of the world
<START> i saw farewell to harry at the <UNK> theatre while in new york city and was quite taken the performance of william hall jr is tremendous this is a movie for the classic movie goer <UNK> <UNK> direction reminds me of early barry <UNK> and robert <UNK> work the movie seems to <UNK> the typical independent film it has a soul and a visual power that is quite unique i saw this with a small audience 400 who were captivated from the moment of the first credit to the last and although i wasn't out and out crying like the lady next to me i do have to admit i had a little <UNK> in the eyes br br
<START> burt kennedy both wrote directed this western taken from a novel kennedy was a well known good writer director mostly westerns br br robert mitchum was a star for over 20 years when he made this this role was like many he had made already one can see why he was a big star for so many years br br he filled this role easily like a well used <UNK> br br the title character is played by robert walker jr his father a fine actor robert walker died <UNK> at age <UNK> his mother is noted actress jennifer jones br br robert was of slight build even though he had talent only made a few films he was in rita <UNK> near last film br br road to the same year was very good br br he looked very much like his father but seemed to lack his fathers charm he made only a few more movies he is still living i wish him well br br most of his scenes are with another son of a hollywood great john <UNK> son david who is still making movies they made a nice team br br in westerns you always have a female character usually she is a dance hall performer today they call them <UNK> angie dickinson <UNK> this role nicely also featured are western <UNK> john anderson jack kelly br br it was film in old <UNK> outside of downtown <UNK> the scenery is gorgeous br br typical of the older westerns there is not too much action there is some good humour the usual ending shoot out br br it is a fast enjoyable <UNK> minutes br br ratings out of 10 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> this isn't among my favorite hitchcock films though i must admit it's still pretty good among the things i really liked were the presence of jimmy stewart he always <UNK> even the most mediocre material and the incredibly scary looking assassin who looks like a <UNK> with just a thin <UNK> of skin stretched over him although it cost the studio a lot of money i didn't particularly care for doris day in the film she seemed to <UNK> a lot and <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> like a yes i know that she was supposed to sing in that manner but this forever made me hate this song sorry br br the other complaint though minor i had about the movie was that it was a little too polished and hollywood <UNK> the original version also done by hitchcock just seemed a lot <UNK> and <UNK> and this added to the scary ambiance
<START> this movie sucks it's horrible if anyone liked it those people should get there heads examined jackie <UNK> character sounds like a <UNK> that guy who tries to kill the <UNK> is a loser and he sucked even though chevy chase was in this movie he wasn't funny this movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have rodney <UNK> ted knight and bill murray even though jackie <UNK> character had the personality of rodney <UNK> character <UNK> character sucks rodney <UNK> was funny he should have returned i don't care about ted knight but bill murray should have returned also the original <UNK> was <UNK> career performance if he was funny in the first he could have been funny in the second br br final comment i recommend this movie to no one this movie sucked it has sucked it sucks now and it will always suck br br 2 10
<START> if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years my worst fears have come true i have never even in dutch movies seen worse acting i couldn't get myself to watch it for more than 40 minutes so if that's the cause of me missing the genius so be it br br
<START> can i just start by saying i'm a fan of bad movies and this is a really bad movie it states on the front 100 passengers 3000 snakes but i think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes br br the snakes don't do anything particularly interesting the whole movie in fact just <UNK> on with little happening although there is occasionally a great gore shot of <UNK> arms and green goo <UNK> bad movies have to have green goo don't they br br but then the ending comes along and will quite literally <UNK> you off you seat in <UNK> and for that this movie gets a boost up to a 2 rating br br there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them br br for example the arrival of <UNK> man' in r kelly's in the <UNK> 'the <UNK> in attack <UNK> you'll know it when you hear it the arrival of the mama shark in attack <UNK> almost every scene of <UNK> <UNK> the ending of <UNK> just for utter disbelief and confusion and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category it's worth sitting through just for that so get drunk stoned whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates br br quite simply if you like bad movies get this but don't get it confused with <UNK> on a <UNK> there's no relation br br and don't pay more than a <UNK> for it either
<START> i never heard of <UNK> before i watched this film and although parts of it are a little tedious i still find myself drawn to watch it when it is repeated on the box at the beginning of the film we are told about a celebrated japanese writer behaves like a lunatic and commits <UNK> in public as the film progresses you are gently <UNK> into twisted logic of mind the stages of his life are are presented in four chapters each chapter itself is a blend of two <UNK> <UNK> the first continues the story with scenes from life and appear in black and white the second narrative is an adaptation of scenes from a novel and these are staged like a play and filmed in vivid colours there is a different novel staged in each chapter between each chapter the narrative returns to the present as <UNK> proceeds towards his eventual ritual suicide this means that the drama and tension is <UNK> until the end br br i suspect that many people will find this film to be boring pretentious and art house i respect that this is not a film for people who want action and a strong story line if on the other hand you are the kind of person who <UNK> the opportunity to <UNK> the mind a bizarre man while watching his life story told in <UNK> of beautiful pictures set to music by philip glass you will love it i loved it br br
<START> <UNK> is a funny movie everyone at the has seen it and all say the same the wheel of cheese was a great part of the movie also the loud <UNK> dear mr so and so you have left you right <UNK> on or when jack goes home and lays down on the couch and cracks a beer <UNK> is hard work <UNK> me up and when his roommate shows interest by joining the club and calling <UNK> number jack buying all the tickets to win the meat <UNK> bloody great movie if you are into lawn <UNK> as you can relate to it if your not a lawn <UNK> forget it i think the evans head would rate as the best club in <UNK> friendly people great company hi to evans head steve
<START> you can't help but marvel at hitchcock's early work <UNK> for example is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago there's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later like using a national landmark as a backdrop this time it's the statue of liberty in north by <UNK> of course it's <UNK> <UNK> you'll also recognize things that pop up later in rear window and vertigo in <UNK> but let's not give away the show robert <UNK> is excellent as is the oh so charming otto <UNK> look for hitchcock's mini western in this one it happens quickly so don't blink
<START> this movie and its subsequent tv series <UNK> has become the iconic stand in for what is great about america br br fame is famous for its music and performances there are several <UNK> including irene <UNK> paul anne <UNK> and the superb gene anthony ray the latter who plays a walk on dancer with no academic or other than street <UNK> is an amazing personality and is worth watching for what is essentially a portrayal of himself a <UNK> to behold as one king was apt to say br br the plot follows an interesting format <UNK> at times genre at other times personalities in some cases but it all really ends in a kind of <UNK> br br where parker succeeds is in pushing this movie into <UNK> <UNK> with the extremely poignant and sometimes beautiful and outright campy music score that matches the performers step for step br br the climax of the film is a climax for all times and this climatic complete cast of many many talented musicians and dancers and music is thankfully repeated throughout the credits these are one set of credits that are well worth sitting through an achievement for the ages the music by christopher gore is a gift to behold
<START> <UNK> was one of the few <UNK> i had yet to discover and i was less than half overwhelmed the french title la i e the fifth <UNK> a very <UNK> phrase for underground <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the statue of liberty br br basically <UNK> is as much light hearted as were the <UNK> steps note this is another <UNK> phrase even <UNK> as a title but it lacks most of the humor so the characters are rather down to earth and it's definitely not as fast paced as a chase movie across the usa from la to ny <UNK> drags its feet from sequence to sequence the sequence at the <UNK> lovely ranch lovely ranch lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole it doesn't really add up to nothing the meeting with the blind man the mixing with circus people the <UNK> city sequence the ny ball sequence they fall flat bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value br br one big problem i can point out is the relationship between the leads robert <UNK> and <UNK> lane which is not building up as with robert and madeleine <UNK> in the <UNK> steps hence the whole narrative structure is floating depending on the addition of new scenes and new scenes only bring us <UNK> the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police from the villains or his action to stop the plotted <UNK> in the <UNK> steps it was clearly scripted as 1 escaping from the police so you know the hero can't just go to the police then 2 running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence br br if you want a better hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda i would advise you to chose foreign over <UNK> they are both chase movies with a catchy finale well really a gripping one and not just <UNK> in foreign as well as beautifully efficient scenes the <UNK> crowd the <UNK> fields the strange mills
<START> this is not especially well written the songs are not memorable the cast however <UNK> a lot out of this martin and lewis in the navy situation they both look great as young sailors they are believable the scenes on the submarine show how <UNK> it must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before br br lots of sailors in many scenes hundreds perhaps in a big <UNK> exercise field and again in a boxing <UNK> br br you will see james dean in his scene he does stand out even though he is an extra here in a scene where jerry walks across a busy street we see some of his almost accident comedy which he would bring into play years later in the <UNK> br br dean giving jerry boxing <UNK> is a good comedy skit to watch for jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late <UNK> and early <UNK> dean and jerry dancing is a bit of a treat not great but better than most non dancing movies br br worth seeing if you don't mind black and white good ending br br tom <UNK>
<START> this is really the only chance to see the magic of james <UNK> writing brought to life his novels are all <UNK> in any real sense and this is the only long story he wrote it was john <UNK> last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died and it is easy to see his touch of greatness the dead is <UNK> in its approach on the screen telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and the troubles could ever hope to tell us hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james <UNK> and perhaps visit this story in your local <UNK> and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper
<START> after reading the book heart of darkness the movie did not do it justice the movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would <UNK> upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie in the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie the director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever made br br of course any book is better than the movie but these weren't even comparable joseph conrad as a writer was brilliant in <UNK> and the <UNK> of the written word the movie doesn't even start to show any of this some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how <UNK> was not in the boat when he died also when <UNK> went to deliver the news to intended she <UNK> differently in the movie rather than the book another major difference was that <UNK> saw the picture of the lady that was <UNK> at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book this was influential on how the audience perceived <UNK> and the movie totally messed that up br br the book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down there was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it there was one exception to the awful actors and that would be <UNK> de <UNK> who played his character was depicted the best though the movie wasn't that great i still would recommend it only if you have read and understood the book very well that way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them if you have not read the book i do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess i loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it
<START> nbc had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of the ten <UNK> and the greatest story ever told and instead they chose to make some <UNK> cartoon that was more like <UNK> than anything else i don't recall a bible passage where lot turns into a pirate and attacks the <UNK> nor do i remember one where <UNK> son develops a serious friendship with an orange nor do i remember <UNK> being some crazy old <UNK> who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting <UNK> terms like <UNK> the <UNK> this was possibly the worst marketing decision in history obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be jewish and christian parents with their kids so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people if they were intentionally trying to offend why not <UNK> it that way and at least reel in the right audience i hope they make a real <UNK> movie someday one done seriously and <UNK> one that actually appeals to people and makes money until then don't waste your time with this trash
<START> i love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great american sitcom i watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job the rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real <UNK> i loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didn't getting into some form of zany trouble that <UNK> involved their students the british girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass the hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot and the principal and her <UNK> that served to somehow move the almost non existent plot forward i loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young but i ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had did they look like that or did you go to the high school that had middle aged people teaching in it that is the high school that everyone else went to the show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools in public schools principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers the school board does but in every episode that i watched the principal made <UNK> to fire her teachers think back to your history class or think of any history class did you ever see an incredibly hot british chick teach an american history class no did you ever see a <UNK> <UNK> that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in no br br teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality what makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out the <UNK> on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines and i'm sorry i just didn't buy it the show could have <UNK> itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single camera format and it should have centered more around the <UNK> relationships with their students and not with each other br br it gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick she was really hot br br in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a <UNK> attempt to understand a profession i only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen
<START> this is a <UNK> hollywood remake of a classic british film everything that made the original italian job entertaining has been <UNK> out of this <UNK> sore of a movie scripted by donna and wayne powers and <UNK> directed by f gary gray i am amazed that <UNK> kennedy martin the screenwriter of the original film allowed his name to be used in the credits for this <UNK> ear martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last 40 odd years even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing br br the humour is forced the drama is <UNK> all the characters are cookie cutter likable <UNK> with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> implausible beautiful safe cracker <UNK> driver and the plot only matches the original on the following points br br 1 three <UNK> the modern <UNK> made versions but <UNK> nonetheless br br 2 use of the names and for 2 of the main characters br br 3 <UNK> a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it br br 4 er that's it br br otherwise what you get is a bland and implausible american by the numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate <UNK> eventually get the better of their evil associate believe me it feels like an awful long time before they do the cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd <UNK> exercise after reading the script none of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly british <UNK> has survived being fed into the hollywood <UNK> machine br br do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound it's a wonder that <UNK> coward hasn't done an aunt <UNK> jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats br br italian job more like italian
<START> the production values in this video are so poor that it is unwatchable the performance took second place to the <UNK> creative <UNK> of the studio with about thirty special effects per minute it is filmed through a cloud of smoke only one or two seconds duration per shot and frequently background <UNK> shine directly into the camera the lighting was terrible for filming there is constant <UNK> in and out with a total lack of visual continuity there may have been some good dancing available to the live audience but the video viewers will never know
<START> after <UNK> years flash gordon still has an appealing scifi adventure epic feel that many of today's science fiction adventures <UNK> for and fail to deliver the only way to fully enjoy this serial is just to sit back and not pick at anything hokey effects dialogue why flash doesn't go for princess aura etc and as for you older people who saw flash gordon back on the serial screen or on t v back in the day if you want this fine serial to remain appealing to future generations get your kids <UNK> to watch this when they're young it worked for me male aged 18 or under 9 out of 10
<START> i suppose i can see why critics give this film two out five stars it isn't fantastic but i think it is worth a look from director shawn levy cheaper by the dozen night at the museum basically 14 year old jason shepherd malcolm in the frankie is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing he will fail his whole <UNK> and have to repeat the grade during summer so he <UNK> his work but getting a lift from hollywood producer marty wolf paul <UNK> who hit him on the way to school he manages to leave his paper with the story big fat liar in the car he finds out from a movie trailer that marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie so he and his best friend she's the man's amanda <UNK> are on a mission to prove jason is for once telling the truth marty of course is too nasty and smug to give <UNK> father harry michael bryan french a phone call and he burns the big fat liar paper so now jason and are determined to make <UNK> life as <UNK> as possible until he agrees to call <UNK> dad they put blue <UNK> in his swimming pool and orange hair <UNK> in his <UNK> and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for <UNK> career there is the obvious point when jason looks like he wants to give up but don't worry all characters that despise marty help out in the final operation and with <UNK> parents coming he wants to finally prove his <UNK> and boy does he deliver big style also starring amanda <UNK> as monty lee <UNK> as vince donald <UNK> as frank jackson sandra oh as mrs <UNK> <UNK> russell as marcus <UNK> christine <UNK> as carol shepherd and american <UNK> john <UNK> as dustin wong is likable <UNK> proves a very surprisingly talented support and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little <UNK> is great at being nasty it is a kids film so if it seems corny cheesy or predictable just keep that in mind and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick okay
<START> the movie is really about choices in the <UNK> state of affairs as seen in fire where good women had to be <UNK> and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition there seemed few <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> however granted that it was not their only option what is life without desire <UNK> questions <UNK> yes it's true that life provides us with a number of <UNK> but how many we can take depends on a number of <UNK> factors when your world is confined to a small indian household being a <UNK> daughter in law to a silent but <UNK> still powerful <UNK> a <UNK> wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a <UNK> of <UNK> due to your not being able to have a child a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in <UNK> his desires i felt the ladies had little choice but to find <UNK> in each other's company i guess the fact that so many women <UNK> ms <UNK> work was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves an option to do what was perhaps <UNK> the lesbian scenes i felt was merely to put that point across every scene in the movie from the first at the <UNK> <UNK> to the last at the <UNK> is <UNK> in my mind how frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires to feel that you had to <UNK> the human touch to be a <UNK> wife just because it is expected of you to have to <UNK> any desire you might have and to <UNK> for the human touch what then is the meaning of our existence one wonders in the scene where <UNK> is crying alone in the room and <UNK> comes in to comfort her their lips accidentally brush against each others and it <UNK> a feeling in them something they have both been <UNK> of br br bravo to ms <UNK> in <UNK> her vision so clearly i especially like the flashbacks to the young <UNK> trying to <UNK> for the ocean it is a metaphor for freedom freedom to choose freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach in those scenes it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who i assume lives within the rich indian traditions of duty in marriage the movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by a r <UNK> since the film i have become <UNK> fans of the two lead actresses and the director i look forward to more of ms future productions
<START> this film is full of charming situations and healthy young people easy on the eyes whether they are wearing clothes or not the strong of its plot is <UNK> by the art of shakespeare as joseph <UNK> discovered back in the 1950s in central park shakespeare's plots can be adapted to the manners and customs of the present and so the classic tales of cross dressing and other <UNK> found in such lighthearted comedies such as <UNK> night and a <UNK> <UNK> eve and as you like it are used to good effect in this film all the young actors and actresses do a good job of <UNK> the plot with their <UNK> and dialog and costumes and the idea of a soccer game to bring things to a climax reminds me of bend it like beckham another charming coming of age movie
<START> a film about the relationship between a man and <UNK> that's very reminiscent of the english patient even down to a scene similar to when ralph <UNK> character carries the body of his lover across a desert rock cliff in a passion in the desert the main character carries the body of the <UNK> across a desert rock cliff but in the opposite direction <UNK> decision or unconscious contrast historically expanded from a very short <UNK> story the film is not perfect but a treat no less final shot will haunt me for weeks 8 of 10
<START> this was a television show that i watched during the 1960s as a child and was captivated by it in the many years that have passed i have often thought about this show and how good it would be to watch it again but being <UNK> that things of the past are not always as good as you remember them this was a great show in the 1960s and has lost nothing even now in 2007 sure there are a few odd production mistakes that you see when watching old shows and it takes a couple of episodes to get used to the dubbed voices but having done that i was as captivated now as i was back in the 1960s the samurai is played by <UNK> who plays the role in a very humble manner i remember during the 60s due to the popularity of the show here in australia he <UNK> performing sword play etc and was overwhelmed by the interest in the show and in him it was great that one of my all time favourite shows still held the magic that it did during my childhood a must see series
<START> this movie was so stupid i could not bare to watch the rest of this movie to think that the spoiled bitch suggested to see other people then walks right into another relationship 5 minutes after the <UNK> was made i really felt sorry for the guy but then again for a guy like that to even consider letting his fiancé see other people to go along with her grand idea well i'm sorry but he deserved what he got and she was definitely not the best fish in the sea either he can do way way way better she had no tits to <UNK> no nothing and you had to have known that she wanted this right from the start 5 years how on earth did they last that long
<START> what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have <UNK> br br this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a <UNK> star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago i missed it when it came out in 1980 br br here's the underlying problem dorothy <UNK> couldn't act so for most of the movie they didn't even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an <UNK> cult status but for the life of me i can't understand why br br clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasn't or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't science fiction is <UNK> for parody as <UNK> and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly
<START> i could crap a better movie this is a waste of time and money it makes me sick that movies like these are actually getting made and the people making them actually think they're good i happen to like teen comedies when they're done well this movie however takes this genre to a new low with movies like this people think it's actually okay to make this filth and ask unsuspecting people to pay money to sit through it it's <UNK>
<START> during the final <UNK> of the war our central character capt <UNK> martin sheen is <UNK> by the cia on an illegal one man mission to <UNK> a <UNK> us marine commander colonel <UNK> marlon brando who has allegedly gone but who is successfully <UNK> a private cross border war from his base in cambodia a neutral and therefore off limits country br br the entire narrated story of what <UNK> sees and does as he is <UNK> up the da <UNK> river by an <UNK> and <UNK> navy <UNK> boat crew to murder <UNK> is a grand metaphor for the <UNK> <UNK> and ultimately the weakness of the <UNK> <UNK> psyche if we don't understand something and we are unable to control it <UNK> it <UNK> had eventually come to know this br br unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in <UNK> <UNK> you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie subtle deal with his <UNK> his in return for <UNK> <UNK> did he nod to tell <UNK> another metaphor for us the next generation the ones watching the movie the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in vietnam is mind <UNK> stuff the bonding between the two men whilst <UNK> cross <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with some of his own horror stories is incredible <UNK> genius film the closing <UNK> scene of the ritual slaughter of a <UNK> bull is the single most powerful of symbols has made intentionally or not the ultimate anti war statement one that should <UNK> through the ages
<START> although little more than a pleasant 11 minute musical <UNK> it's rightly billed as a <UNK> musical every sunday is one of the most famous and precious documents in cinematic history since it provides an <UNK> look at the <UNK> talents of two of the <UNK> most talented and beloved musical performers deanna durbin and judy garland br br although often <UNK> as an screen test of sorts produced by mgm to test the adolescent appeal of studio durbin and garland whose <UNK> were reportedly coming up for <UNK> this <UNK> is not entirely accurate by the time every sunday was produced in july 1936 deanna <UNK> contract with mgm had already <UNK> and she had been immediately signed by universal a month earlier in june 1936 br br however a <UNK> in <UNK> mgm contract <UNK> the studio to exercise an option on her services for up to sixty days providing she had not yet begun work on a picture at her new studio as <UNK> debut vehicle three smart girls was still not ready to begin filming mgm chose to exercise its' option and although officially under contract to universal at the time durbin found herself back on the mgm lot filming this <UNK> short subject with fellow adolescent singing hopeful judy garland br br this along with <UNK> far more extensive prior professional performing experience training which included appearances in several earlier movie shorts may explain why every sunday often seems to favor judy garland over deanna durbin giving garland more lines to speak and an original song <UNK> to sing while durbin offers the popular classical art song <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> certainly it would make perfect sense that mgm would want to favor one of its' own contract players over another from a rival studio br br ironically although <UNK> character is the more overtly pro active one of the two girls in this short it would be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> little miss <UNK> screen persona at universal which would <UNK> her to <UNK> worldwide super stardom as the world's first teen idol with her debut vehicle three smart girls while <UNK> more passive <UNK> <UNK> adolescent image would see her generally cast in supporting roles opposite frequent screen partner mickey rooney and in <UNK> girl the up and coming <UNK> turner not until her <UNK> mgm feature for me and my gal which was also her first fully adult role would garland achieve the solo above the title billing and solo attraction status of a true superstar that durbin had <UNK> <UNK> six years earlier br br it is entirely inaccurate therefore to <UNK> that garland was the only superstar attraction of the two girls as durbin <UNK> this status with press <UNK> public almost a decade before her mgm rival literally in <UNK> at the time of her <UNK> the on screen evidence strongly suggests that universal was much <UNK> to realize <UNK> full superstar potential than mgm was with judy and it's worth noting that almost every notable accomplishment garland achieved at mgm from superstar billing to having starring vehicles specially written to showcase her talents and appeal to being invited to plant her <UNK> in the <UNK> of chinese theater to receiving an <UNK> oscar in recognition for her talent deanna durbin received well before her gifted mgm contemporary br br in any case every sunday is a delightful utterly <UNK> musical short its plot line durbin and garland use their singing talents to save <UNK> grandfather from being <UNK> retired by the town <UNK> from <UNK> his sunday <UNK> in the park <UNK> the plot lines of both <UNK> let's put on a show musicals with mickey rooney and <UNK> 100 men and a girl unlike <UNK> later babes films the short never treats the <UNK> storyline seriously and consequently its' eleven minute running time flies by br br of course the true magic of every sunday is in <UNK> the already remarkable performing talents screen <UNK> of durbin and garland at the very beginning of their legendary careers both girls even at this early stage possessed remarkable screen <UNK> and are utterly natural and <UNK> in their presentation as both singers and actresses garland fairly explodes off the screen with <UNK> as she literally punches out the lyrics to the <UNK> <UNK> as she <UNK> across the number with appropriate hand gestures judy literally seems to be chewing on the words of the song as she <UNK> up her mouth and bugs out her eyes in her intense <UNK> to show what she can do br br by contrast <UNK> presentation of <UNK> <UNK> is far more <UNK> and subdued although entirely appropriate for her classical selection <UNK> delivery of <UNK> is much more of the traditional stand <UNK> sing variety than <UNK> physically <UNK> turn nevertheless though <UNK> <UNK> deanna does nothing to call attention to herself with her <UNK> eyes dazzling smile and <UNK> delivery she easily holds the screen with jazz baby judy and their delightful <UNK> of <UNK> in the <UNK> finale makes one regret all the more that producer joe <UNK> was never able to realize his dream of pairing durbin and garland in a musical feature film because universal refused to <UNK> number one asset durbin out br br a priceless document of the <UNK> talents of two remarkable and utterly unique talents see this one if you get a chance
<START> when i first watched with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage no one is that rich and lives at a <UNK> off the pacific coast in the show <UNK> is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice <UNK> is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is she is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure and she is such a freak she talks about like she knows what they are when she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she <UNK> it and another thing that <UNK> me off is that she is always chewing a piece of <UNK> every time you look at her and everyone wants something do with her for example in one episode that logan guy <UNK> 4 000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life and her friend nicole is an overly <UNK> freak that screams a lot and lola dresses like a <UNK> <UNK> lady 80s called they want there <UNK> hair back might as well <UNK> off the hair chase this show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they don't have the latest i <UNK> and designer clothes they will hate themselves br br this show is a big thumbs down br br we hate you jamie <UNK> br br best wishes ryan and <UNK> l
<START> flesh is hard to describe with a solid summary because well there basically isn't a plot the film pretty much just shows the day in the life of a hustler named joe joe who is in the underrated louis <UNK> picture black moon as he makes his rounds sleeping and <UNK> around to cash in the bucks to pay for his wife's <UNK> abortion br br not much and since the film is quite a lengthy <UNK> nine minutes you would think that flesh would be a slow moving and boring hour and a half you think wrong the film is made up of <UNK> no screenplay and the angles of the film are pretty on the spot as well yet there is some kind of truth beneath every frame that gives the film its <UNK> entertaining <UNK> everything makes sense and serves purpose in what happens to joe in this one day he meets a regular john that is obviously lying when saying he wants to see joe again a photographer who talks so much that it <UNK> joe to tears two drag queens who read out of <UNK> magazines as joe receives head from a <UNK> voiced addict who <UNK> on later about how she wants to get a breast lift an old friend of joe who reads male on male rape stories to him and then a final scene with his wife and her lover that <UNK> echoes the scene at the start of the film one of the best <UNK> to a film i have seen in quite some time  and tells completely what the film is overall <UNK> about br br it's astounding how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless even though it's set in 1960s new york city in real time in real place and is filmed like an obvious independent flick from that era it's certainly not a film that could be made today which adds on to its delicious <UNK> br br <UNK> by unexpected jump cuts and absent of a score to advance its images  flesh is about as raw gritty as a film about male prostitution in the 60s can get
<START> warning i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment br br this movie was on the shelf at a movie store and since i had seen a handful of very corny horror flicks there i had really low expectations for this one well i put it in and almost immediately i was sucked right in while watching i got deeper and deeper into the story and pretty soon i was staring in complete interest this movie is surprisingly spectacular and i loved every second the story is about a boat ride down a river in australia it seems safe enough until their boat is <UNK> by a croc who's ready for some food when i looked at the back of the case i thought that this movie was going to have crappy visual effects like in lake <UNK> 2 and a lot of others but when i first saw the crocodile it looked amazingly real don't laugh when i say this for i am being serious but this is one of the most <UNK> films i've ever seen it really knew how to build up nail biting tension and suspense with it's intense situation i mean think about it your stuck in a tree nowhere to run nowhere to hide with a hungry predator in the depths of the water below you can not tell me that doesn't freak you out just a little it even managed to give me a few chills down my arms like when adam was taken by the croc and grace and lee are left <UNK> this is a very appealing movie there were maybe 1 or 2 parts where i found myself slightly <UNK> but other than that i would say this is my favorite animal attack film that i have seen
<START> if only the writer producer star had the slightest <UNK> of the limits of his acting range and the way he is perceived on screen wearing glasses and a side <UNK> is not enough to make you look <UNK> and quirky if your face and teeth have been <UNK> by various medical professionals to <UNK> to american ideals of generic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perceived as beauty in this <UNK> superficial society he would have cast john <UNK> as the main character instead of attempting to pull a good will hunting and create a vehicle to showcase his his well himself br br the excellent supporting cast lord knows they must be having problems to agree to this is wasted in an <UNK> <UNK> struggle to react convincingly to a main character incapable of delivering even the <UNK> line with appropriate <UNK> and believe me he is not short of simple lines to choose from as the dialogue appears to have been composed by a five year old ah wait it's the same person pretending to be a writer as pretending to be an actor it's not often that i don't see a film through to the end but this <UNK> was <UNK> from the outset and showed no signs of <UNK> after the first hour <UNK>
<START> i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada particularly in <UNK> that's because the <UNK> have <UNK> loved hockey and the <UNK> <UNK> were like gods in canada for decades as an american the closest thing we have to them are the new york <UNK> if you are a fan then they are the greatest and team in history if you are not a fan then they are <UNK> team well at least that's how it was as i grew up in washington <UNK> in regard to the dallas <UNK> so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the <UNK> br br now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around <UNK> and rooting for the <UNK> and maurice the rocket richard however when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto <UNK> <UNK> jersey and forces him to wear it i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable
<START> a good documentary reviewing the background behind our societies oil addiction the problem concerning our present energy usage and finally <UNK> the effects of the coming energy <UNK> <UNK> from the peak oil production problem br br this movie should be educated to all students as part of their education show it to your children parents relatives and friends they will thank you eventually br br after reviewing the <UNK> of this documentary and comparing its mentioned sources i would say that the facts in this movie are well <UNK> supported
<START> when a group of <UNK> start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case as the deaths continue to <UNK> mr martin obviously isn't having much success by the end of the movie the strange truth is revealed which i won't reveal here br br one of the other users commenting on this states this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart i'm sorry but i have to <UNK> disagree with this opinion it is classic only in that it is old not in any sense <UNK> to its quality i've enjoyed a lot of low budget b movies from around this time period but this isn't one of them br br the pacing is <UNK> slow the camera work is pretty bland most of the acting is fairly wooden even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion and the plot while it has an interesting premise seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner
<START> <UNK> is one of those awful stupid movies that you actually kind of enjoy just because they're so crap i just watched it on tv my friend and i were amazed at how dopey it was it's true that don simpson and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap <UNK> flick with lots of <UNK> bodies to help sell a soundtrack of <UNK> catchy pop so <UNK> is an odd sort of <UNK> the first mtv movie adrian <UNK> started out in advertising and it shows because <UNK> is almost a commercial for itself you've already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird <UNK> <UNK> as though it's frightened that you might change your mind at any moment it keeps selling itself to you over and over all the way through using slick commercial style editing and glossy close ups of <UNK> breasts the story is <UNK> thin i honestly can't think of another film i've seen with less plot and it never makes much sense but its a very contrived <UNK> movie so it feels consistent people say it's dated but <UNK> was always rubbish viewers in the early 80's knew it was just cheesy t a but it does work in its own silly fashion there's <UNK> romance for the chick flick crowd and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> female bodies for their dates all set to a <UNK> disco beat how could it fail it helps that the dialogue is pointless so you can grab a popcorn without missing anything major and if this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea you can always laugh at the <UNK> on display the scene where a stand in for jennifer <UNK> on stage in front of a tv with a fan in it and a face full of white clown make up had us in <UNK> a genuine guilty pleasure
<START> the chinese film title of in the mood for love is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it can be interpreted as those <UNK> years that once were br br the whole film is a well composed piece a complex love story told in simple visual approach writer director wong <UNK> <UNK> has choreographed a dancing of the hearts it's she it's he it's love i can hear theme <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the strings almost like a piece with <UNK> and <UNK> br br director the use of music michael score <UNK> king cole singing in spanish and chinese songs tunes the rhythm and lyrics <UNK> viewers to what she and he is feeling thinking rather than verbal dialogs i can hear <UNK> king cole giving us the clues <UNK> that thing <UNK> eyes green plays when the two meet and when she's <UNK> br br nostalgia <UNK> throughout the film design details <UNK> <UNK> and ties japanese rice <UNK> novelty the pattern green glass <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i remember dad <UNK> those at home session kitchen area bedroom <UNK> the <UNK> for the take out <UNK> that she <UNK> when she walks maggie cheung <UNK> and <UNK> looks exquisite in those <UNK> <UNK> colors of the traditional chinese woman clothing <UNK> every change of her dress <UNK> another day another time in the story wong <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> that way br br the scenes may be of the same place but it's of a different mood advanced to the next <UNK> up and down the stairs to the won ton <UNK> stand standing by the wall around the corner to the apartments as the rain <UNK> along the <UNK> back and forth to his writing corner br br trivia so she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel maggie would be able to help as she's been in kung fu martial arts movies eastern three heroes 1992 is a fun action movie with maggie cheung thief <UNK> chat michelle <UNK> and anita as three super heroes fighting <UNK> br br if you appreciate tony <UNK> performance don't miss <UNK> express 1994 in the second segment romance rhythm with a difference and happy together 1997 an intense emotionally colorful painting of friendships faith and fate both written and directed by wong <UNK> <UNK> br br being able to understand the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and having visited the official site i realized the <UNK> was not quite completely translated here's sharing my version of the chinese <UNK> br br it was kind of an unbearable encounter all along she has kept her head <UNK> giving him a chance to get closer he didn't have the courage to be closer she turned around walked away br br that time and place had come to past all that <UNK> no longer exist br br those <UNK> years seemingly separated by a glass gathering dust can see yet cannot grasp br br all along he has <UNK> for all that's past if he can break through that dust gathered glass he will walk back into the times long <UNK> br br wong <UNK> <UNK> in the mood for love brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and outer ' the and <UNK> of life love and living br br <UNK> ruby 2 22 <UNK> br br
<START> i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad i'm surprised anyone took it seriously characters are one dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys the only merit here is that it's so lame it's funny actually for me there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where i live so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hoot br br the lead character is a off duty cop and makes a big point of <UNK> a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea it's against the law imagine how long that lasts br br most of the movie's northern california characters are blown <UNK> hollywood cheese balls looking like they've never actually been in a fight the story line is totally predictable this film is <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> camp value only i'm pretty <UNK> of films in general but seeing the old positive reviews i had to speak up this is a dog i give it a 3 out of 10 and then only for laughs
<START> i'm not a big fan of musicals but i was always <UNK> of ms <UNK> looks so i thought i'd give it a try br br this may be the best showcase for the multi talented ms hayworth she's never looked <UNK> in a film with the possible exception of <UNK> where she is sex symbol par excellence br br rita is more than <UNK> <UNK> by gene kelly and phil <UNK> the comedy may be dated but it is still quite amusing kelly does one of his tour de force dances dancing with the image of himself from a window br br but rita drives this whole movie an excellent cast featuring otto <UNK> and the always wonderful wise cracking eve <UNK> doesn't hurt br br rita sings rita dances all the while looking <UNK> beautiful the music may be short of classic but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever br br i find this movie works better than <UNK> which i regard as a flawed film to ms <UNK> credit she also drives <UNK> and <UNK> drives any red blooded male insane br br the film holds up well after all these years much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus
<START> i understand that this was <UNK> attempt to save a movie that was the <UNK> the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality as much as i love troma they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work the acting was terrible one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of <UNK> parker doing the <UNK> joke with a goofy wig on there are a lot of big director <UNK> in this movie like james <UNK> and eli roth friends of lloyd kaufman again i think this was attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose <UNK> of dollars i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess check out other troma titles
<START> to date this is still the worst piece of rubbish i've ever viewed so annoyed i even complained to blockbuster for <UNK> it me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film the plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding the film ended quite abruptly i'm guessing they ran out of film sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway the guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder after wasting all the time to go into in depth discussion on the <UNK> and its many power tools he <UNK> to put a plastic bag over her head all in all on second thoughts i think you have to watch this film to actually believe it exists
<START> i wasn't expecting a great deal from this film so i was pleasantly surprised when i watched it and found it to be most noteworthy it's is mainly due to the talent and appeal of it's star john garfield br br garfield plays jack a boxing star who is framed for murder he must go on the run and ends up out in the sticks with gloria <UNK> and the dead end kids here is offered a chance for redemption yet will the past catch up with him yet garfield was an actor ahead of his peers before the term <UNK> was even <UNK> and before brando ever screamed <UNK> ' he brings to the screen his <UNK> quality and amazing acting talent dominate this production also interesting is that his role here as a boxer has shades of that <UNK> <UNK> role he so desperately wanted to on screen garfield looks the type and goes the distance as a boxer proving his acting worth br br ann sheridan is here in a small role at the beginning as jack's <UNK> girl goldie i haven't ever thought much of sheridan but i liked her here she plays well off garfield performance is a little tired and she does not share good chemistry with garfield the dead end kids are here and garfield seems their natural idol even more so than cagney claude <UNK> is miscast and he looks uncomfortable in the role in many a scene strange as he always was such a reliable actor br br also interesting to note is the director busby berkeley best known for his early musicals with dancing girls and <UNK> images directs a different genre here with remarkable ease he maintains a gritty atmosphere throughout admirably br br a very good film that deserves greater attention 8 10
<START> there have been many people that have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story heart of darkness some movies have been based on heart of darkness like apocalypse now in 1993 nicholas <UNK> directed a film that was exactly like the book heart of darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book this movie is full of action and adventure heart of darkness is about the journey of a <UNK> named <UNK> who <UNK> along the <UNK> river to meet the super powerful <UNK> <UNK> mr br br heart of darkness the movie has the same exact beginning and setting as the book it takes place on a boat in the <UNK> river and <UNK> is telling the story to four other men on a boat called the <UNK> the whole movie is a flashback of <UNK> journey to see mr <UNK> on the <UNK> river <UNK> works for the <UNK> company which <UNK> <UNK> along the <UNK> river he tells of his account in the <UNK> office and about all of the <UNK> he saw in the office br br <UNK> sets out on a <UNK> to africa he arrives at the central station where he receives orders from the general manager the general manager tells <UNK> about mr <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would be doing <UNK> soon finds out that the general manager is not fond of <UNK> because he fears <UNK> will replace him <UNK> waits around at the central station for months because his ship has been <UNK> and it is getting <UNK> <UNK> sees the harsh treatment and <UNK> in africa while at the central station when the ship has finally been <UNK> <UNK> another african character named and other crew members set <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> for mr <UNK> br br along the <UNK> river they are attacked by african natives in the wilderness as <UNK> crew is attacked by the african natives they end up shooting and killing when <UNK> finally arrives at station he meets a russian who explains the might and glory of <UNK> <UNK> is then led to station home there he sees many <UNK> and pictures that <UNK> has painted finally <UNK> enters the room and begins to tell <UNK> about all he has done in africa and talks about his mistress <UNK> soon finds out that <UNK> is insane with power because the <UNK> <UNK> him as a god <UNK> becomes angry with the <UNK> and <UNK> that he sees in africa after <UNK> finally meets <UNK> <UNK> begins to die while <UNK> was on his <UNK> he called <UNK> into his room life begins to flash before his eyes and his last words were the horror the horror when <UNK> returns to europe to see fiancé <UNK> tells her that last words were her name to hide the darkness in life br br heart of darkness was directed well and was formed into an adventurous movie i recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery the movie is slow at times but in all it really interesting heart of darkness will really <UNK> your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes
<START> marathon has a very interesting premise excellent <UNK> sounds and good scenery unfortunately the movie aside from these aspects falls flat on its face for a woman trying to complete so many <UNK> <UNK> in a day she spends an awful lot of time standing around <UNK> and not doing <UNK> i believe there is more walking shown in the movie than her work on these <UNK> also while i understand the point of showing so much scenery there is simply far too much of it the movie is incredibly boring and <UNK> it's not worth buying renting watching on television or viewing in any <UNK> way i lost interest so quickly that i'm not sure why i sat through the entire film in the first place
<START> this is a really good flick with awesome humor jim as we know was very good with facial expressions and demonstrates a lot of it in this movie this is definitely the best of the ernest films i would surely recommend it to any ernest fan out there i find myself to have great taste in movies and i'm sure anyone will enjoy this movie in the movie ernest plays 2 roles bad guy and good guy and plays them quite well i really enjoy exaggeration type humor where things just seem impossible like in the naked gun films for example and there is plenty of it in this movie i bought this movie right after i saw it good directing good script worth renting
<START> this film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years br br it basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills and he says wrong things all the time the plot is hollow and contrived the main character james is lonely but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored it is more like an empty statement which other subplots <UNK> from sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial there is a serious lack of emotions in the film br br it is not funny as a comedy either there are some funny one liners but that is it it lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to <UNK> people with happy mood i don't find i want someone to eat cheese with funny
<START> poorly acted poorly written and poorly directed special effects are cheap best performance is by <UNK> but that's not saying much story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to <UNK> of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard br br there is little suspense and even less action there's one car chase that's not bad but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time
<START> this is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around the production values are in a class of their own the characters are rounded and interesting this is entertainment at its best some of the aliens are quite grotesque but there is an underlying humour which makes it <UNK> i hope that this series goes on for many years and will have many spin offs science fiction has had its bad press some justified but this is truly a <UNK> science fiction series and i thank <UNK> for it top marks
<START> tom dodge despite having a reputation among <UNK> as a <UNK> and maverick note to reader maverick does not mean tom cruise maverick means non <UNK> is actually an intelligence <UNK> for the vice <UNK> of his submarine fleet the vice <UNK> is concerned about our old friends the russians <UNK> yard sales with their old <UNK> countries like <UNK> north korea or iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> or florida and this was 6 7 years before 9 11 br br the <UNK> <UNK> dodge to assume command of a <UNK> <UNK> wwii <UNK> sub and <UNK> an exercise against the surface fleet and the <UNK> orlando a top of the line fast attack sub dodge takes command and in no time <UNK> up the bad news bears <UNK> i mean his lovable group of oddball <UNK> into warriors despite having welcome aboard <UNK> on his penis he is a competent and fair commander he does not choose favorites and he <UNK> authority in a responsible manner the us navy could not have come up with a <UNK> piece of <UNK> propaganda than this <UNK> made under appreciated gem from the creator of police academy
<START> sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 1 2 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and <UNK> father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress very well acted especially by julie <UNK> rupert plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the harry potter series of films laura <UNK> plays his <UNK> strict mother without a hint of redemption so there's no room to like her at all but the film is a very entertaining film made well by the british in the style of the likes of keeping mum and <UNK> girls
<START> as a <UNK> of ms frank i remember being so excited that the play was being re made for tv that is until i saw it this film is a prime example of how important casting is and how directing plays such an important part in creating the sense of purpose the casting of any central role is crucial to a production of this sort shows like <UNK> <UNK> and man of la <UNK> are totally <UNK> on the charisma of the lead actor and in the cast of this movie the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious casting of melissa gilbert in the lead role there is not one single moment that ms gilbert even comes close to <UNK> the sensitive mature spirit of anne ms gilbert is white bread throughout the movie the only time i was close to tears was during the reading of <UNK> most haunting line i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart this is spoken by ms gilbert so rushed so lacking in conviction that she might has well and achieved the same effect film and dance legend <UNK> champion was the dialogue coach for this production she should have <UNK> her <UNK> despite ms gilbert ruining diary other performances are satisfactory for the most part special kudos to joan <UNK> as edith scott <UNK> as peter and clive as mr <UNK> does not have the deep <UNK> soul and spirit as otto as does the creator of the role on stage and film joseph <UNK> but he's okay doris roberts and james <UNK> as the van are relatively superficial in their parts they're shrill and <UNK> but again only on the surface this could be due to the fact that the pacing of the project is way too rushed as noted in previous <UNK> this film <UNK> in 45 minutes shorter than the film version the difference <UNK> to the pauses for dramatic effect which apparently is necessary to <UNK> the appropriate mood for the story this is not mandatory viewing especially for youngsters learning about anne frank for the first time stick to the original film version and or even better the tv production of anne frank the true story starring ben kingsley which is the closest thing to capturing the <UNK> and reality of <UNK> situation ever filmed note especially appalling is the fact that <UNK> marshall who plays <UNK> sister <UNK> is not included in the opening credits along with all the other members of the secret <UNK> she's listed in the post credits along with the actors playing and mr if i was ms marshall i would have <UNK>
<START> weak tale of an evil <UNK> who is searching for a centuries old satanic bible so that he can do <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> creation hot in pursuit all the way is a <UNK> bounty hunter named and his reluctant sidekick sound like a load of <UNK> it is br br this drivel from writer d t gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director steve <UNK> who <UNK> that romantic nonsense forever young obviously knows nothing about true evil br br julian <UNK> just flies around and <UNK> trying to look evil while richard e grant succeeds only in wasting his rich talent <UNK> <UNK> career also took a <UNK> with this one br br special effects crew has some fun and jerry <UNK> provides a score superior to its subject matter
<START> as a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager i tend to watch all sorts of movies from good to very very bad this was a movie with so many corn ball lines cheesy cgi effects and predictable plot points that i ended up laughing <UNK> before switching it off after 30 40 minutes the creature feature genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years godzilla 2000 anyone but this movie makes me think the creators weren't even trying it might be worth checking out just for the make fun of me potential count the <UNK> but i couldn't in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone
<START> this is by far the worst film i have ever seen it has next to no plot and the plot it does have is very scattered the story line is lacking in both content suspense and subtitles as what would appear to be story line is in russian the set appears to be only one room with various lighting effects and at the moment you think something good is about to happen you are let down by the total lack of acting drama suspense horror gore story line and mythology the directing style has been done to death the <UNK> camera it would seem that the only action in this film is within the last 10 15 minutes and the action is made worse by the actors inability to portray the suspense correctly the only interesting thing about this movie was my dog <UNK> at the surround sound
<START> the opening screams zero budget the titles <UNK> in look like my <UNK> was let loose with <UNK> the dvd box gives the impression that you'll be treated to the old days of '80s <UNK> movies nope hardly any nudity from a flick that stars <UNK> <UNK> this movie really did need the nudity too instead you get a lot of <UNK> pointing through a shirt however they seem to be <UNK> by hot steam that's odd in my world the <UNK> go on in the cold br br the plot is pathetic the blind guy is just is a joke and not a funny one his antics are so forced and predictable he <UNK> over stuff and you see him <UNK> for the fall he needs to work on his physical comedy br br most of nudity comes from a hot <UNK> scene that looks like it was shot months later and inserted in to get a <UNK> and the nudity is not worth it br br it's just a matter of time before <UNK> over that not even funny as billy arrives in town for the first time they come across bucks he comments wow they have these everywhere this leads you to believe it's a parody on <UNK> but surprise behind the counter of this location is herself apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a tiny cold town br br the only thing this movie has going for it is the warren miller footage yep this is all <UNK> stuff so if you want to see great action get a warren miller flick leave <UNK> alone br br there is nothing good about this movie there is no reason to rent it or buy it and if a friend offers to <UNK> you a copy for free hit him and end the friendship
<START> sigh i'm <UNK> when i see a short like this get attention and <UNK> and <UNK> i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards it was mildly annoying to see it <UNK> the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak tim burton ish style and the story that goes nowhere and we got the joke about shooting the <UNK> with the 45 the first time alright br br but i guess what's really <UNK> is that it even <UNK> its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called <UNK> the cute little dead girl by roman <UNK> as any quick internet search will reveal i mean what is this this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker give your head a shake as don <UNK> might say
<START> this movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town i now have many friends who are guards at dixon <UNK> and i myself worked for 3 <UNK> at the store next to the store the old lady was at however this is still the dumbest movie ever made destined to be introduced by gilbert or <UNK> <UNK> if it hasn't been already a bit of trivia <UNK> doesn't even have <UNK> <UNK> and dixon prison is a medium security facility <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> machine <UNK> the classic <UNK> seduction scene is perhaps the most amusing piece of writing i've ever seen especially with the suspenseful build up
<START> why is guy working for buddy probably because <UNK> was not around in 1995 why does dawn want to be with guy for access to buddy why does she stay with guy i am not sure br br there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal <UNK> as buddy <UNK>  and totally believable because he is a great actor br br frank guy is certainly out of his element working for buddy  he wants to write and make meaningful movies not be a <UNK> that is <UNK> abused for getting equal instead of sweet low br br michelle dawn who also wants to make meaningful movies seems way out of guy's league br br the ending leaves a lot to be desired
<START> a big disappointment for what was <UNK> as an incredible film incredibly bad very pretentious it would be nice if just once someone would create a high profile role for a young woman that was not a prostitute br br we don't really learn anything about this character except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic we don't know why nicholas cage turns in an excellent performance as usual but i feel that this role and this script let him down and how after not being able to perform for the whole film can he have an <UNK> on his <UNK> really terrible and i felt like i needed a bath
<START> debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know it's also the only one that focuses on the l a punk explosion of the early eighties it's all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the <UNK> whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can not be over <UNK> but also the <UNK> the media and first of all the audiences the <UNK> all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh <UNK> and gasp with <UNK> about the energy the anger and the fury these <UNK> put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it to mainstream music but the underground was <UNK> if you need a proof for that watch performance in decline <UNK> great film how come this is not available on <UNK> <UNK> or dvd p s the follow up decline <UNK> ii is hilarious too
<START> horrible movie this movie beat out revenge of the living zombies for the worst movie i have ever suffered through what the were the morons who made this film thinking was it supposed to be scary because man let me tall you it wasn't it was so dumb it wasn't funny we all know that <UNK> islands are the natural hunting grounds for killer <UNK> and those stupid baby <UNK> stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid fake snow and lousy actors oh and frost looks nothing like he does on the box do not waste your time rent it and destroy it
<START> lonely <UNK> middle class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks <UNK> to reflect on her immediate future at some sort of bed and breakfast by well literally in the sea the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she <UNK> for the owner enter lonely arrogant richard gere he is a plastic surgeon he is the only guest at the <UNK> in the sea diane lane is the lonely housewife you'll never guess these two fall immediately in love a <UNK> storm makes them true lovers br br the subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense the locations photography are fine gere remains one of the most over rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint ms lane must've needed the money but phones in her part with grace
<START> the 1970's saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as <UNK> films the term is a reference to kind of broad catch all rather than a true genre of film in short any comedy drama adventure western or urban cops robbers shoot em up that are so constructed and so cast as to appeal to the large urban black population of the mid 20th century that indeed could embrace the <UNK> type of films as long as the had a <UNK> toward the inner city black population br br it appears that the idea of producing these films of particularly keen interest to black americans had its <UNK> with the release of 100 <UNK> marvin <UNK> <UNK> 20th century fox 1969 in it former university all american <UNK> and several times all pro for the cleveland <UNK> jim brown had a co starring billing having appeared in a number of films already as for example <UNK> 1964 the dirty dozen 1967 ice <UNK> 1968 and others it was beginning to make more sense to the <UNK> suits that jim was a hot property br br now this 100 <UNK> brings record numbers of black <UNK> to the big <UNK> central business <UNK> on <UNK> sunday to view mr brown why not start to film more of these adventure epics and other types of film with more black players and stars why not indeed so we saw a succession of cops robbers bad ass private detective films comedies all going the route along the way we eventually got to some more family oriented wider appealing films the movie goers were treated to 1972 the take 1974 1974 and ultimately <UNK> 1974 br br in <UNK> we find no <UNK> nor easy <UNK> as being <UNK> as the story is universal and could easily have been done as a story about people of any descent any where and not just in the 1970's usa br br that the story was done of a single mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> struggling to keep a family together after two <UNK> and two almost <UNK> is a far cry from a shoot em up harlem style the problems that plague the everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the ol' <UNK> <UNK> br br but we also consider psychological and physical needs as a female for woman needs man and man must have his mate and we do <UNK> this point that's s e x that we're talking about <UNK> <UNK> meets up with a very <UNK> broad <UNK> athletic type in private garbage man <UNK> b marshall james earl jones and they go on a date br br the great <UNK> state <UNK> with the couple as <UNK> case worker miss <UNK> <UNK> comes <UNK> around to see just who is this <UNK> male who is suddenly paying so much attention to family br br after a <UNK> experience with the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> which would be the norm for the family the two decide to get married with or without the <UNK> of big brother br br meanwhile elder son has gotten involved with some big talking but little doing black <UNK> group but with help he and they all come through it a o k br br it ends on a happy upbeat and hopeful note we know that it may not be exactly happily ever after but rather make it all together if there is a single criticism that we must state it is that sometimes in a movie like this a <UNK> is spread to a large portion of urban blacks and that is the apparent implied myth that all whites are wealthy having none of their kind ever in need of a helping hand out of work or suffering any <UNK> br br well folks it just ain't true note at one point jim <UNK> career was a real hit as a rugged <UNK> he was even being <UNK> as the black john wayne note the idea of producing films with all black casts filmed for all black <UNK> was not a new idea in the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> we saw productions from people like noble johnson spencer williams jr and rex <UNK> br br note that's as time goes by you know <UNK> it's from casablanca warner brothers 1942
<START> i thought <UNK> film managed to do without words what few films have been able to do with them capture true human emotions the main character's struggles <UNK> set backs hopes and desires are all so honestly shown that you wonder if he is acting at all the film has a low budget and is obviously made without the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to most hollywood productions but that <UNK> is what allows this film to <UNK> the stereotypical sci fi <UNK> and become a true drama however calling this film solely a drama would take away from the fantastic post apocalyptic plot true this type of movie has been done been before but i think this one captures the <UNK> and <UNK> of that type of world possibly better than any other one does
<START> i sat <UNK> through this film becoming more and more <UNK> at just how it got made at all the script itself makes the acting look embarrassing and it <UNK> becomes a waste of time for everybody concerned if you avoid seeing one film this year make it this one
<START> <UNK> wars rips off everything in star wars but if you are planning on doing any parody you need to do it just a bit better than this not that there is anything wrong per se with <UNK> wars but if you spoof do it well or not at all
<START> this film is an attempt to appeal to a younger <UNK> of <UNK> to 24 <UNK> and an insult to all of them i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary remake early in the film one of the characters <UNK> i am surrounded by idiots this is the defining moment in the film which goes <UNK> down from there full of clichés red <UNK> scares and unexplained events the film is also full of characters who are not exactly <UNK> a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies and that crappy it's so dark i cant see scenes stolen from chainsaw massacre but merely annoying not building any tension nor horror it's difficult to film in the dark and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that's suppose to have tension but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case the better maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well or he doesn't know how who knows unless you have never seen a horror film in your life or you are two or three years old every aspect of this film is predictable and done before warning paris hilton is in this movie enough said all in all a <UNK> slasher film which begs the question where the h ll is the wax it was treated like a lost leader if you're bored as possible and all other <UNK> are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror film which isn't really scary or you'd like to see paris have a pole smash through her head go ahead and take a chance it's not the worst movie i've ever seen but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants i pray that they are <UNK> a profit driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre you know smart characters make for a scarier movie i believe this is debut as a director besides commercials and music videos he has another one coming out in 2006 called goal 2 hopefully his goal is to make a better film
<START> an awful film badly written badly acted cliched hackneyed <UNK> the premise is such a good one and a chance to <UNK> about black <UNK> but the film is truly dire it is a curious mix of a bad 1950's randolph scott b movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western the villains are cardboard the flashbacks laughable the dialogue excruciating br br the deliberate <UNK> such as rap singers and modern swear words like <UNK> er are irritating to the extreme br br a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table
<START> you know people who make comedies so often forget it's really ok to be outrageous well not this time <UNK> love has it all barry <UNK> and a dwarf in a movie with cathy bates as the romantic lead and it works not only does it work it works very very well in fact i think it's perfect i laughed so hard i think i hurt myself yet the main characters were all so human so honest and so very real but isn't that where great comedies come from don't characters need real feelings real emotions and the ability to feel real pain well they do in this movie <UNK> love is a movie you shouldn't miss especially if you need a seriously good laugh or you're at all curious about seeing the psychotic dwarf in the red <UNK>
<START> what is it about the french first they apparently like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does second they seem to like edgar allan <UNK> work more than just about anyone else does it's got to be the effect br br don't get me wrong i'm a poe fan myself but this trilogy manages to make three of <UNK> below average stories into well i'm not sure what they're made into br br toby <UNK> is a fine fellini film but it has nothing to do with <UNK> story at least in terms of theme it's enjoyable on the first viewing <UNK> <UNK> does a good job with an interesting role however it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead br br is a big mess how did <UNK> films get produced it's just awful not even up to amateur film school standards depending on the dvd menu you have try to skip it and save your time br br william wilson is actually the segment that is most faithful to <UNK> work it does not have much style though even if it includes the strangest <UNK> fight i think that i have ever seen on film it looks like the boys are throwing <UNK> or maybe <UNK> that have been rolled up into balls br br my advice is to skip watch william wilson and then if you're a fellini fan i'm not keep toby <UNK> on while you cook dinner or make a <UNK>
<START> this review is in response to the <UNK> wondering how <UNK> correct the movie was br br saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my italian grandparents who came through <UNK> island at the turn of the last century would subject themselves to all manner of <UNK> <UNK> just to enter america br br it was certainly eye opening since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there my grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived br br i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting <UNK> island and the museum actually walks you through the <UNK> <UNK> process the filmmaker obviously did his research right down to the medical <UNK> and equipment questions and <UNK> they are all there at the museum even the wedding pictures and the review board room <UNK> correct anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie inspirational to say the least
<START> this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable saga why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards the <UNK> are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby they aren't as terrifying gruesome some what spine chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before i used to love their <UNK> shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring and what is with the killing and not eating i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong why did <UNK> have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie this movie <UNK> me disgrace disgrace
<START> ok number one this film is a 90's version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers number two as soon as the movie started i was confused it was like i walked in halfway through the movie there was no plot it was very annoying horrible wardrobe call me crazy but it's just not believable to me that little skinny omar <UNK> can chase down a big grown man without a gun and scare him into talking it's a ridiculous plot i'm sorry but to me kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time let alone catch some evil underground killers i walked out of the theater and <UNK> and got my money back i do not <UNK> this movie to anyone over 12 years old
<START> <UNK> is a heavy metal band from the great city of des <UNK> <UNK> in which the <UNK> wear their own distinguished mask i know someone already said this but i need to fill up space for this review the band members are joey mick sid clown james corey chris and paul this band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be heard by everyone that loves hardcore rock another good movie is called which shows the <UNK> performance at the london <UNK> the my plague video was shot there and is included on the dvd the most kick ass song they made is also on there <UNK> so if you love the band you need to see this and if you love heavy metal music then you have to hear this band
<START> an <UNK> alien <UNK> crash lands on earth and soon <UNK> havoc upon the <UNK> first using his laser ray gun to <UNK> into dust almost every human he catches sight off that is when his aim isn't terribly off and later his bare <UNK> with which he likes to rip out and eat human <UNK> br br all in all it's pretty silly stuff i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects however it doesn't help when the monster provides the movie's only truly entertaining moments and he isn't on screen for a large portion of the film's running time the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff <UNK> is much too unattractive to be <UNK> the film's <UNK> chick i also have to take off points for blatantly <UNK> the thing from another world 1951 on several occasions when the monster isn't on a rampage is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun watch this one back to back with the 1951 thing and see the difference characterization attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie
<START> a stunningly beautiful charlotte lewis stars as a woman who is <UNK> by a ghosts who torment her on the phone driven to the edge in terror charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life i can't believe that <UNK> <UNK> the director behind <UNK> <UNK> cannibal holocaust and house on the edge of the park directed this absurd piece of trash admittedly the music by <UNK> front man <UNK> is pretty good but the story is painfully stupid the script by franco is ridiculous and it makes no sense the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense the scene in which a <UNK> rapist of charlotte lewis is killed by <UNK> <UNK> from a subway <UNK> is more than laughable don't waste your time with this piece of crap there are far better italian horror movies out there
<START> i completely forgot that i'd seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself the <UNK> version of <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> locked door country house mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying br br as a mystery the major problem is that it is <UNK> by the audience like the worst agatha it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been <UNK> to as a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non existent with the exception of the killer everyone is a face value version of the typical suspects in the typical country house murder story reporter <UNK> <UNK> suspicious fiancé <UNK> scientist father a surprisingly poor michel etc there's no depth and little of interest and the frequently over <UNK> or <UNK> performances don't help you frankly don't care about anyone in it so there's no <UNK> or suspense only claude rich and in the last reel pierre <UNK> get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of <UNK> that is too fleeting to be really effective br br for the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of <UNK> would be comic set pieces a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off with dennis reduced to irving the for the last third of the picture i'm not fond of country house movies or agatha christie style so those who are might it a lot more slack but i found it a poor show as rich says when the mystery is revealed it's all rather something of a disappointment
<START> <UNK> from tv guide br br this week on the love boat captain has his hands full when a gets on board with an unexpected <UNK> join the captain <UNK> <UNK> and julie in a fun filled halloween special guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the br br this is typical lame sci fi channel cut rate fare the captain of a cruise ship played by the once respectable john rhys davies is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of mexico his daughter is along for the ride and she's <UNK> her keep by being the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pay attention everyone that <UNK> will come in handy later it should be noted that the <UNK> daughter is pretty <UNK> and painful to watch it would have been good if she might have taken a couple of <UNK> classes before trying to play an <UNK> in a movie br br captain stupid and his daughter join mrs <UNK> from <UNK> island a <UNK> and a dark mysterious stranger on this 90 minute ride into boredom br br that's right i said he keeps mentioning that he brought some precious <UNK> on board that he needs to check out needless to say the box contains a that somebody decides to let out from this point on a man in the rubber suit runs around the ship killing people captain stupid is <UNK> to stop it he decides to call in the marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship br br the marines respond they say all that marine speak stuff like and get some but those silly marines are no match for a they don't really tell anyone where they're going either so there's no help in sight i guess no one will really miss some lame <UNK> of lost marines but don't forget captain daughter is thankfully a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for little stupid she comes in right in the nick of time she beats up the <UNK> goat sucker and saves the day means goat sucker therefore suck but there's no way that suck anywhere near as much as this movie
<START> i think did her evil part very well she should have won an award anything that dunne is in is <UNK> because dunne is a great actress and can pull anything off even a weak script therefore i would recommend it for this reason alone this movie may have been a little ahead of it's time the plot might be more acceptable these days br br during the golden age of hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times this plot seem to <UNK> from that profile yet again i must say what ever irene dunne was in at least was good because she made things so believable the only other actress i can say made me think this way was maybe deborah kerr watch silver <UNK> if you get the chance for the acting if nothing else
<START> this flick was the introduction for a lot of us to the works of k gordon murray that's because it was easy to find it was on every public <UNK> label in the vhs era and before that a late night t v cult classic double <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> besides how do you resist the title br br for late <UNK> a brief explanation of it's merit florida <UNK> dealer k gordon murray <UNK> mexican horror films dubbed them into english then made a <UNK> with them at the drive in the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were <UNK> <UNK> great great set design and lighting were placed beside weird or laughable special effects nothing in hollywood was as close as these were to out and out strange now mix in catholic influenced social conventions mexican folk <UNK> and we are not in kansas anymore br br add to that the english scripts they were dubbed into most were written by who wanted words to match movements of the actors lips on screen not the literal translation as a result the american <UNK> tended to run from overwrought to down right <UNK> there's even a fan web site for murray that <UNK> the best most over the top lines for each movie first time viewers to the films complain about the pacing the purple <UNK> the production values and are told it's supposed to be that way while the people laugh with enjoyment over things normally considered fatal film flaws it all must be very confusing if you don't have a taste for it br br this one was made back to back in 1957 with the two previous films in the series the aztec mummy and curse of the aztec mummy all three are now available on the 3 disc aztec mummy collection <UNK> and it's about time it has the k gordon murray version on one side the original mexican production on the other side the contrast between the two is fascinating a lot of the times the original spanish is not much <UNK> br br robot mummy starts off with a nice long flashback bringing you up to speed on the previous episodes sort of continuity was tossed out the window in number two and it's downhill from there logic wise you don't even get the angel back or any mention of him in this final episode names places even family trees switch between films after a while you start looking for the continuity changes br br by now the series villain doc is totally pig biting mad nearly <UNK> with <UNK> and still wants to steal the aztec <UNK> is sent back to the past with another nice edit of the aztec mummy floor show and wanders out into the dark in her <UNK> to help find that <UNK> again the mummy isn't any happier with this then he was last time br br the robot actually has a production credit it was made by co s a ' i mention this because it looks like the grips came up with it between takes on a slow afternoon when the real costume went <UNK> nope br br this was planned br br wait until you see the <UNK> it runs from x box where were you when needed you the robot looks crushed to death at the end but actually came back in two more mexican made movies it had a fan base br br all in all a funny quirky finish to a three movie series sit back and enjoy
<START> pretty decent for his early work and no without it and gets an 2 points extra for the <UNK> eggs for <UNK> definitely a <UNK> in the ladder i am biased as a <UNK> fan but this was a big step from dirty pair which was what i knew of him violent fun with a porno soundtrack you cannot help but notice that i know people appreciate him for ghost in the shell but all of the deep spiritual overtones were dealt with in killing terrorists the struggle for humans to stay <UNK> as phase them out and staying thin despite her <UNK> of junk food definitely like the characters even the <UNK> and i do not know why
<START> it seems like an exciting <UNK> a modern dress othello with christopher <UNK> who was so <UNK> good in shallow grave and especially jude and <UNK> walker who brought such intensity and <UNK> to his pivotal role on oz one would think them both natural <UNK> but both performers misfire <UNK> othello is a fairly cookie cutter take on the part with a <UNK> delivery that doesn't make much of an impact and <UNK> <UNK> it up <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the role it's likely he was <UNK> on by his director whose <UNK> approach might have worked better with <UNK> language but who seems a jarring pretentious choice for this <UNK> screenplay and the screenplay itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious  it's as if andrew davies <UNK> out the famous plot and then just wrote whatever dialogue first popped into his head all in all a failure 4 out of 10
<START> i had such high hopes for retro to air this but instead of having shows such as this ones that don't get the treatment that they deserve they air things that i may have seen dozens of times before br br the was the highlight of my pre teen years i know that may seem a little bit clichéd but it's true after duke from g i joe jake is another one of those cartoon characters that i really had a crush on br br it's too bad that retro doesn't see it the same way people of my generation do otherwise retro would be a lot better than it is
<START> saw this film when it was an entry in santa <UNK> film festival heavy film depiction of a completely dysfunctional family taken to another level of the extreme might have left me depressed to the extreme had it not been for very funny sight gags and dialogue along the way which <UNK> the film's overall tone the relatively uplifting ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy still i did not walk out of the theatre ready to go to a fun party the film stayed with me for several days br br brought back memories of ordinary people but with humor mixed in with the tragedy i thought the acting was excellent especially by <UNK> weaver and <UNK> how each character dealt with the tragedy was at times sad self <UNK> but also at times hilarious clever dialogue and situations
<START> i can't say i enjoyed this as much as the big <UNK> or raising arizona and felt a little <UNK> but o brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the <UNK> twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the <UNK> and i was interested to find out that the are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and i'm only saying this in comparison and it wasn't worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal br br though i enjoyed the previous work i've never been a fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on <UNK> i guess that's why i didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this i don't mean to offend any of your people i'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like a <UNK> tale when you live in the city all your life it's hard to get <UNK> to films of this nature but all apologies aside i found the characters fun and quirky i think john <UNK> nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life i find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooney who i assume is not the best at <UNK> accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a new england accent for the perfect storm naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot <UNK> <UNK> like holly hunter in a short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for a short time but steals every minute of it br br though i don't normally dig country music i liked the title song a man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song br br overall i found the film entertaining and original but it doesn't have that in your face quality that the have shown to us in the past it's a <UNK> effort but a good one i still suggest you check it out br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> in these days of ultra fast and the internet coming up with a movie like the matrix may seem merely the next step from the term but do you remember what computers were like in 1974 right to come up with the notion of virtual reality back then is truly an amazing feat of the imagination <UNK> movie of course has none of the massive <UNK> and <UNK> and a lot of <UNK> elements instead but the atmosphere it creates is intense and poses the question how we can know what is real in a dark and gripping manner making this a <UNK> and a thriller for the mind it also takes it up a notch on more recent <UNK> stories if you get out of one <UNK> can you be sure you didn't just emerge into another level of virtual reality
<START> if you take the movie for what it is worth you won't be disappointed if you think murray is supposed to win an oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting don't bother it was funny when i saw it in 1979 and hasn't lost its charm good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks the story line is simple and easy to follow murray has done better but this is his first film the movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained <UNK> is the head <UNK> and plays the part perfect the other <UNK> are typical <UNK> up teens looking to have fun during the summer one nice thing about this movie it has a message
<START> alexander lou star of classics such as 'the super and vs <UNK> here in this entertaining martial arts fest br br the plot involves the evil <UNK> white who boasts some <UNK> and frankly somewhat scary looking white <UNK> <UNK> the aid of a ninja clan in order to <UNK> the shaolin temple br br this goal he achieves and furthermore <UNK> out most of it's members although needless to say one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the <UNK> <UNK> br br ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the <UNK> in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like <UNK> vs aka 'the ninja <UNK> really care much for such an <UNK> factor as a plot of course not it's the fights that matter in these films and by <UNK> you get your <UNK> worth here there's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason br br if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see
<START> this movie is highly improbable read the other reviews to see why br br i would say that most of the characters were plastic but they didn't even afford themselves that little luxury they just act like cardboard <UNK> of course they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles so that's a crap shoot whether they can act at least didn't give a crap and just went with it but lance <UNK> br br the one character who <UNK> true was portrayed by <UNK> lopez who didn't really act he was himself pretty much he's quite <UNK> to <UNK> people the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a <UNK> on my <UNK> when it came on some cable channel late one night that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time <UNK> no way i would go out of my way to watch it
<START> after my daughter was born in 1983 i needed to lose weight i tried the 20 minute <UNK> and i was hooked i lost about 50 <UNK> it was the most weight i ever lost in my life i can't believe this show is forgotten it would be a <UNK> if you started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included the 20 minute <UNK> i think this was the best <UNK> video ever made i wish i could purchase it somehow and somewhere the routine was easy to learn and you did work up quite a sweat the <UNK> they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn please do your best to get this video back in <UNK> i pray it will be a <UNK> to all who see and use it
<START> watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching star trek for the first time br br this series has it all the kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the tv to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair in awe and endless admiration br br in short we start out with john an astronaut who gets shot into a <UNK> and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the <UNK> in black ironically known as <UNK> br br other colorful characters consists of big dude with a short temper and a sword laser rifle sun former and a <UNK> d in who's a plant no really she is she's also a priest but with a mean streak there's also <UNK> an fat lazy bastard who <UNK> <UNK> and generally does more harm than good br br later in the series we meet the most sexy alien that has ever been on television namely a young and seemingly <UNK> horny she is played by <UNK> which is a name you should remember br br one of the many things i love about these series is that since john ended up in this part of the galaxy by mistake he keeps giving references to real life namely when john is having a bit of difficulty accepting the fact that he will be frozen as a statue for 80 years one of his many complaint is that when he returns buffy the vampire <UNK> will be dead br br so all the other series get your <UNK> together and spend an <UNK> on one of these episodes i can assure you sci fi as you know it will change forever br br this series has it all it's sexy it's <UNK> it's <UNK> it's <UNK>
<START> the extraordinarily adorable <UNK> plays a <UNK> performer obsessed with <UNK> in the theater her husband and played by bernard <UNK> is a composed but jealous man when he finds out in a less than <UNK> way that his flashy wife has planned a <UNK> with a <UNK> old businessman with the intention of <UNK> her career he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder now at that point i must stop describing the film to you because it <UNK> on such thin ice with its twists revelations <UNK> and suspense that to imply any of it would <UNK> it i am not sure how good or bad that is for this french police <UNK> <UNK> from the song and dance community though it is certainly interesting that what we do know throughout is who did not do it we just don't know who did br br the story depends upon the <UNK> of following clues where ideal <UNK> fail and where <UNK> created <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> interestingly this is a suspense film in which suspense is generated in spite of the knowledge one would <UNK> think too much too soon br br <UNK> of the is the least dark of <UNK> georges <UNK> films it's nowhere near as sinister as the shocking les <UNK> as tragic as the riveting <UNK> of fear or as <UNK> as le maybe it is due to the of the dance <UNK> and theater settings of 1940s france which all work as the <UNK> of this crime thriller br br <UNK> both understands and <UNK> of his characters even the more rotten ones where he has more of a <UNK> streak with his other films where he may have had understanding for the scheming women in les <UNK> or the truck drivers who sink to the level of <UNK> horrible death in order to <UNK> themselves from miserable life in the <UNK> of fear there isn't necessarily support or <UNK> on the part of the filmmaker for these are characters who <UNK> made the direct decisions that determine their fate all the characters in this more <UNK> film have scenes and moments that <UNK> us to them even the harsh cold detective played by louis <UNK> who <UNK> about his young <UNK> son amid all the trouble and despair that happens in his life at any time with the drop of a hat br br there is humor and <UNK> <UNK> the latter mostly on the part of that <UNK> the pressure to a degree <UNK> was quietly practicing his craft patient till he made his <UNK> later films in which he would <UNK> his audiences no <UNK> from the tension
<START> a <UNK> soldier in world war one rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of he creates an aggressive <UNK> war machine and a little <UNK> <UNK> sound like anyone you know br br from the safety of hollywood chaplin uses this <UNK> to europe to take up arms and defy hitler and <UNK> given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of <UNK> ahead of it and no strong desire to itself in <UNK> civil <UNK> remember it was hitler who <UNK> war on the usa not the other way round it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> br br the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and <UNK> and the reign of terror over which he <UNK> <UNK> and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly <UNK> brave etc etc chaplin is and he also plays the jewish <UNK> the little hero of the ghetto the tramp in all but name needless to say chaplin writes directs stars <UNK> the music and does the <UNK> br br in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third <UNK> and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical <UNK> but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong a comedian and a chaplin tries to <UNK> hitler by making silly and hapless all this does is to <UNK> him when the not very <UNK> soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside down <UNK> he becomes endearing rather than despicable as dictator he <UNK> his technical <UNK> which don't work the <UNK> hat the <UNK> uniform etc and these <UNK> are meant to make us think that the real life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside in fact regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling br br in truth <UNK> day had already passed when he made this ill considered <UNK> at heart he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen check out the humour with gags like <UNK> up and down the street semi conscious or the <UNK> of the <UNK> in the the hero <UNK> is meant to represent a <UNK> of european decency against which can be judged but <UNK> looks more like a character from <UNK> than a nazi is it in any way believable that a <UNK> figure if such had existed would say to the face your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid ruthless <UNK> of innocent people and how does <UNK> come to be in the of the jewish ghetto if he is the object of an <UNK> <UNK> why does he <UNK> in wearing his <UNK> uniform chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of <UNK> or but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of <UNK> with the grim spirit of the age as usual chaplin thinks in terms of comedy set pieces loosely <UNK> onto the narrative clothes line there is the <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> a man to the <UNK> of and the globe ballet watch for the segment filmed in reverse br br <UNK> is the <UNK> perfect hannah just as the people of the ghetto are <UNK> nice and the jewish <UNK> in is ridiculously <UNK> so hannah is quite literally too good to be true brave <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and of course beautiful she is the <UNK> of <UNK> in the ghetto cage gee ain't i cute she asks after the <UNK> gives her a make over too cute by far is the answer she doesn't come close to <UNK> true because chaplin has made her a caricature the <UNK> it be wonderful ' speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author too <UNK> too emotionally <UNK> br br jack <UNK> is great as the fascist dictator of <UNK> he brings a <UNK> of much needed comic <UNK> to the proceedings but the film's underlying weakness remains if is silly and <UNK> how can we fear him and anyway the <UNK> stop start of the back projected train is a fine <UNK> example of a gag that is <UNK> with far beyond its comic worth br br and where did the jewish <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> uniform
<START> the <UNK> of box office big league stars is phenomenal in this movie william baldwin <UNK> sutherland kevin bacon and julia roberts this movie was made in one of my favorite years too 1990 i am a and the setting in chicago was very <UNK> and artistically as well i liked this movie and the <UNK> which motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful element to the plot which was utterly sensational br br centers around a group of disgruntled pre <UNK> students who want to be flat <UNK> as a way of <UNK> some sort of societal <UNK> when life does not make sense it would appear very illogical to get curious about apocalyptic nightmares at the same time once their <UNK> curiosity has gotten the better of them there is no turning back the king of the hill so to speak is the one who <UNK> shouts i will do two minutes who else is going to do that anyone want to try for two and a half ultimately all of these newly arrived and very <UNK> <UNK> now have an extremely <UNK> <UNK> in these re pro lives the <UNK> to their justified or <UNK> pathos required a full <UNK> degree perspective on the issues they were <UNK> over whatever purpose all of this reckless and academic <UNK> serves it is definitely an original approach for <UNK> your personality i liked this movie 1990 was a good year for me too things seemed to fall into place that year when i saw this movie some night in november during the year 1990 i was very glad that i did
<START> it seems everyone wants to jump on the <UNK> and say go go go the word is <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i grew up with this series in the early 70's here in la on the late and very <UNK> channel <UNK> before that there was <UNK> boy dating from 1963 on ol' tv <UNK> boy was the first tv example of anime we got here in the states i was into anime as a kid and followed it until the late 80's when by then it'd become a series of badly animated talking heads a phenomenon which has only gotten worse <UNK> said br br as for speed <UNK> i really enjoyed the <UNK> there the <UNK> shots the cinematic aspects of live action <UNK> adopted to animation that was fairly typical of most japanese anime back then graphics graphics graphics take note sometime how obviously the series was inspired by stanley <UNK> film grand <UNK> 1966 especially the <UNK> american credits br br oh yeah i have the original comics from which the series is based so i know of which i speak br br what were we doing animation wise besides crap like johnny quest same ol' stuff we'd been <UNK> since the <UNK> ho hum br br i guess the real problem i had have with the way anime was is shown on american tv is the <UNK> job done on the scripts credits etc to <UNK> them for american audiences i won't go into other programs as we're <UNK> speed here br br look at <UNK> like peter <UNK> as one of the <UNK> here as he was 99 responsible for the re writes of the series not to mention the voice of speed <UNK> x and others between him and the goofs at <UNK> <UNK> think felix the cat and the mighty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they took a slick very sophisticated show and dropped it down to the level of <UNK> street think <UNK> <UNK> the company skull if i go on i'll <UNK> br br this series dates from 40 odd years ago but i at the time was keen enough to feel insulted by the <UNK> down of this and other japanese programs i mean it's obvious when someone's <UNK> killed but they either remove it or <UNK> it over br br good show originally sadly all the more recent <UNK> of the series have that crappy made in korea look not to mention being <UNK> pc in content even the japanese <UNK> their animation now br br try the original japanese opening on youtube sometime it sends chills up my spine if only oh well robert
<START> spoilers the original road house is one of those movies that i know is clichéd and unoriginal yet it's done so well i'm embarrassed to admit i really like it turns out many of my friends whose movie opinions i respect think the same way so when they attempt to make a sequel to it and it's as if it was written by some high school kids who were given the rights to do a sequel it's just bad really really bad br br oddly <UNK> <UNK> is listed as one of the writers and i can only hope his <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> the writing was just bad and all the writers of this film should <UNK> for complete lack of originality and some of the worst dialog in this millennium <UNK> already appearing to be the king of the straight to dvd sequel <UNK> 2 poison <UNK> 2 and now after seeing this and <UNK> 2 i'm thinking his acting ability is non existent he was awful just awful br br and it's not the terrible fighting scenes that make this movie terrible but take it from me they're bad every fight scene is a slowly delivered punch yet still making the sound in the air that is then <UNK> by the <UNK> who returns a punch that sends the first guy to the ground this is repeated throughout the film worse than any bad 1970s cop show or the fact that many of the people involved in the fights seem to have a mouth full of <UNK> <UNK> aid for some reason and we're supposed to believe will <UNK> is a fighting machine his fight scenes look so amazingly fake i was honestly embarrassed watching br br it's the complete <UNK> of logic in this ridiculous movie that make it terrible for instance <UNK> <UNK> character is in town for a day and already tells some girl he barely knows who he has no idea what side she's on i'm with the <UNK> but don't tell anyone the female villain who fights the good girl in one fight scene with <UNK> that rival any super hero yet is easily held down by the will <UNK> old guy in another scene by simply holding both her hands while he <UNK> some ridiculous line stab me once shame on you stab me twice ain't gonna happen <UNK> that's bad and then head <UNK> her jake <UNK> villain shoots at the <UNK> while caught in the middle of a drug deal yet no <UNK> agents or anyone simply go to his place and pick him up after in fact he's simply let go because this is the <UNK> territory busey wants the bar because it's in a great location for drug deals yet his own house appears to be just as good apparently offering all the <UNK> the bar is supposed to have <UNK> <UNK> character is supposed to be the son of patrick <UNK> character in the original yet <UNK> character's last name is dalton and <UNK> isn't nor is the supposed brother of <UNK> character and <UNK> <UNK> looks about 50 in this movie i looked it up he's 17 years younger than <UNK> but he looks awful br br but my favorite absolutely stupid scene in this movie was the most stock fight scene ending in movies the villain is knocked through a window on a second floor and as they pan down i'm thinking please don't tell me he's <UNK> on something and sure enough my worst fears were realized br br actually i could go on for another half hour about the things i hated about this movie suffice to say let's put an end to these ridiculous straight to dvd sequels to theatrical movies at least the ones with <UNK> <UNK>
<START> rules of engagement is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen it is well constructed superbly <UNK> together and provides excellent footage to back up the <UNK> that it takes on the movie's best quality is that it is not based on being sympathetic to the as much as it <UNK> the audience to the blatant <UNK> mistakes and lies that surrounded the entire situation i'm left with feelings of disturbing anxiety and extreme anger over the way that the government handled and then covered up a tragedy of this <UNK> the cover up is what left me really <UNK> it is one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt but another to look the american people <UNK> in the eye and lie to them i guess it shouldn't surprise me with the history of our beloved country that has seen the <UNK> assassination the vietnam war and other significant events that smell so bad of a cover up that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through washington d c the footage from an airplane with special heat <UNK> technology and the <UNK> on some of the bodies clearly show that the fbi is lying to the public one of the things that i try to stay aware of when watching a documentary such as this is that i am usually only receiving <UNK> from one point of view but again that is without a doubt one of the brilliant <UNK> of rules of engagement it presents its evidence in such a <UNK> fashion that even if you were presented with statements from the fbi how could you really believe them i remember clearly when the <UNK> was taking place the way the media presented the as this crazed group of cult rebels with david the self <UNK> <UNK> jesus christ as their leader none of this was truly factual but rather story <UNK> from bits and pieces of facts they were simply standing up for there rights to bear arms and practice their religion as american citizens if you were the and you wanted to search the compound is attacking the building with a unit of men who are armed with <UNK> and bullet proof suits the way to go about doing it if you are the fbi why engage in psychological <UNK> and offer little in actual <UNK> to help solve the situation why pour <UNK> of <UNK> gas if you want to save children why open large holes within the compound structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire why lie about not firing weapons when it can be clearly shown on video unless unless you wanted to see the situation end up the way it did the scene at the end when the star of david flag blew off the <UNK> into the fire and the was shortly thereafter raised up was an emotional climatic scene that made my head shake in disgust and my stomach turn <UNK> the filmmaker william deserves one my highest <UNK> it takes a lot of guts to make a movie like this and i am sure there have been many <UNK> from the government for it as well because of people like him the public can be shown real truth rather than crap that gets <UNK> through a media that presents information that can hardly be considered genuine when i think back to how i felt at the time toward the because of the <UNK> representation of david and how i felt after seeing this movie it is truly amazing it reminds me of the line from the bible of a man who was <UNK> by jesus and asked by the <UNK> how it happened before i was blind but now i can see he kept telling them do yourself a favor and watch this movie you may have to look for it but it is truly something special
<START> 2005 will go down in <UNK> <UNK> history as its most incredible year everything seemed to click a first rate new doctor and companion big audiences 10 million for the first episode and christmas special major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years <UNK> at the seeming inability to <UNK> stairs were well and truly <UNK> but then christopher <UNK> dropped a <UNK> <UNK> after just one series it looked like the honeymoon was over luckily the public appears to have <UNK> his <UNK> the excellent david <UNK> on top of this the show boasts fine s f x like the spaceship crashing into <UNK> <UNK> in of <UNK> and superb story lines such as <UNK> of ghosts the new <UNK> <UNK> is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century some fans have accused russell t davies of <UNK> the show they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along
<START> i saw this very emotionally painful portrayal and it was fascinating the conflict between the public and private faces of williams and the pressure he was under is <UNK> in a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised the cast acted superbly but michael sheen was outstanding i only realised it was him when i saw the earlier comment he looks completely physically different in this role from any other role i have seen him in or as himself williams autobiography <UNK> <UNK> from his <UNK> as represented in this film the film is at times <UNK> to watch because of the emotional anguish displayed however it is a worthwhile experience and a film that can be recommended highly
<START> at first i didn't like they way the director was constantly switching from the past <UNK> travels to the present <UNK> in the insane asylum but it really is the best way to film the story even though it took some getting used to <UNK> is outstanding as the title character and edward fox makes a wonderful villain worst part is mary <UNK> as <UNK> wife she never has been hollywood gorgeous and in this film they make her look downright <UNK> for some reason i'll never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it adds nothing to the story plus you want to <UNK> her for being so damn stupid in believing the lies bad guy bates keeps telling her even her son can see thru the bastard still a good show and i rate it b
<START> how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk br br but br br see the movie despite its <UNK> there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while <UNK> so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact you'll probably find yourself down the <UNK> and riding the storm out why <UNK> and <UNK> played their characters very well i have never been a fan of and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian but he <UNK> in good fashion <UNK> carries the movie <UNK> with the best of <UNK> ability i don't think mrs robinson had anything to do with his success br br the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too much br br from here on out i can only <UNK> pick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just don't expect a smooth ride br br 7 of 10 but almost a 6
<START> may or may not contain spoilers br br <UNK> is not a good anime it's actually very overrated why there's absolutely no story line no plot and the show just drags on and on and on that's because there are more side stories and <UNK> than episodes that make the plot progress and the <UNK> are just the same stories being repeated over and over again the same episodes seem to go with the same plot <UNK> a jewel <UNK> a worm <UNK> <UNK> demon thing pops up <UNK> says wind <UNK> iron soul <UNK> etc and kills the demon they get the jewel <UNK> and then we just repeat this scene <UNK> or more times br br besides the repeating of episodes there's the repeating of comedic devices and they're not funny anymore wait they never were sexual <UNK> is not funny <UNK> rated the series older teens 16 i have no idea why they rated it that there's nothing bad about it except for the so called funny sexual <UNK> which is kind of suggestive and that could get you arrested these days br br now this is how we know <UNK> is overrated the <UNK> they all sucked especially the mask game i played that at my friend's house it wasn't anything interesting the game was slow boring and it had <UNK> 64 like graphics in a magazine it got a rating of 4 10 saying this role playing game is slower than moving up a cocktail straw then there's all these stupid <UNK> toys action figures <UNK> cards <UNK> and <UNK> books <UNK> books we thought <UNK> was 16 maybe not but after being a member of <UNK> groups on <UNK> about half the people on there were 10 to 13 i guess <UNK> is a little kid anime after all i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show it could be shown on <UNK> there are over 40 manga volumes i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them sad br br then there's the music the music is so annoying we hear the same 5 songs every episode after 10 episodes the music gets really annoying in other anime they have music to fit the mood and we don't hear some songs very often there are about 15 different <UNK> <UNK> don't waste your money on that garbage br br and how do you think i know all this because i used to be a fan of <UNK> i feel ashamed of myself i'd rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead sadly those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than <UNK> will ever have
<START> absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever a totally essential educational experience for any music fanatic especially young rock punk fans today understanding the <UNK> of any particular artistic movement absolutely requires understanding the roots of the music as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time and besides all that this documentary is flat out rock n roll f u n do not miss it that said can anyone tell me when if ever the decline of western civilization part 1 not part 2 the metal version will be made available again hopefully on dvd
<START> i <UNK> thought this was the 70's art film about the bed that eats people which sounded interesting it isn't interesting i mean let alone about a man eating bed br br i assume stuart gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that lloyd kaufman puts troma on just about anything that's been shot with a video camera in the interest of building up a franchise library little more can be said about this <UNK> other than the running time is less than 90 minutes it is of course about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false <UNK> along the way we get a five minute opening credit sequence is the one for lawrence of <UNK> even as long a murderer with <UNK> <UNK> contacts who kills using the same technique as the <UNK> in <UNK> eye <UNK> of a sexual practice michael <UNK> may have employed a preview of what <UNK> <UNK> will soon look and act like soft core porn even <UNK> would pass on and one topless scene a wacky or is it <UNK> <UNK> ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and <UNK> <UNK> pie well it looked that way to me and a <UNK> surprise ending <UNK> of nothing much it's like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the <UNK> before finishing the last draft br br it's not scary it's not sexy it's shot on hi <UNK> video and doesn't look bad but doesn't look good either the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else no one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie the modern day double feature i wasn't paying attention for parts of it so i may have missed something but for some reason i doubt it rating pass
<START> i loved this film it was so intelligent but it also had some great action sequences without <UNK> the movie solely around them quinn sutherland and kingsley all put in fantastic performances and there are enough twists to keep anyone interested the ending was great as well
<START> this is a case of taking a fairy tale too far the enchanted <UNK> delivers dorothy <UNK> as a terrible ugly <UNK> and robert young as a <UNK> pilot long story short scarface marries <UNK> after which their love transforms them miraculously lighting <UNK> and the <UNK> of fake <UNK> into beautiful magical change that they <UNK> to the <UNK> of living in a <UNK> <UNK> that has been the <UNK> of generations of <UNK> br br if the story stopped there fine it would be a fable with a proverbial message beauty is in the eye of the <UNK> but it <UNK> ahead reaching for reality when mr and mrs scarface <UNK> their public it comes as a painful shock to them that they're still <UNK> you see they only appear beautiful to each a situation which the audience is well prepared for because all the secondary characters have been <UNK> that ill <UNK> people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy you know take up <UNK> <UNK> does <UNK> for instance scarface considers collecting <UNK> br br the original playwright arthur wing and the filmmakers have zero faith in human nature their message is you're either ugly or pretty and no pretty person would ever love an ugly one what's even worse ugly people evidently need to imagine their lover as pretty reality just won't do br br one wonders what <UNK> mason saw every day when she looked at her husband stephen <UNK>
<START> i'll admit that this isn't a great film it practically screams low budget yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it <UNK> with energy it was like the little engine that could and a movie <UNK> into one br br the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their low level employees two page boys one very <UNK> and <UNK> and the other one a <UNK> as well as a new <UNK> all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their <UNK> jobs br br into this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue i didn't know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise however like most b mysteries the cops are and it's up to our <UNK> hero <UNK> to try to save the day throughout all this i had a hard time deciding if <UNK> was obnoxious or endearing i'm still not sure br br there is a moment in the film that is high on the <UNK> and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians they show up in black face and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of <UNK> <UNK> andy apart from being very <UNK> it also wasn't funny fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same way br br overall it's easy to skip this film and i wouldn't blame you if you do however the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic <UNK> of the film and i am glad i saw it a good film no but one that is still worth a <UNK> for fans of old <UNK> br br by the way perhaps i just don't have very good taste but i thought both female singing <UNK> really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their listen for yourself and let me know what you think i just couldn't believe either was allowed to sing on film even if it was just for <UNK> <UNK> studios
<START> i'd be hard pressed to say what is it that makes this film so important to me while a very good movie this is definitely not the most outstanding <UNK> film still along with the american soldier it keeps making it into my personal list of favorites whenever i get to thinking about it
<START> this is one of the <UNK> movies i have watched in a long while usually if they are this strange i <UNK> out early and rarely regret it luckily i held on for this one while i can't say that this is a great movie it isn't i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with did i really just see that <UNK> lots of laugh out loud moments a great cast of characters with meredith <UNK> outstanding as the dwarf daughter in law with an attitude keep an open mind
<START> oh my god it just doesn't get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely <UNK> that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not br br i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film
<START> i remember <UNK> in florida when this movie aired i had set up my vcr to record it the anticipation was killing me i had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier we came back from florida 4 days after the movie aired and i immediately watched it i tried as hard as i could to like it but i didn't br br i am a huge 3 stooges fan and as such i know quite a bit about them so it wasn't like i was expecting to learn anything from the movie and i didn't i was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was there were many things wrong with this film the actors the script the <UNK> all could have been much better br br paul ben victor is a tremendously talented actor but let's face facts moe howard was way out of his reach he doesn't look like him he doesn't sound like him and thus he can't act like him michael <UNK> is also very talented but his portrayal of curly didn't quite score with me although when curly becomes ill he did very well at that john portrayal of <UNK> could've been <UNK> better it was more of a bad impression than a portrayal worst of all was joe <UNK> they made him skinny and more annoying than he really was it was just plain <UNK> i don't like the joe shorts because as the movie illustrates he hardly ever got hit but he wasn't that annoying and <UNK> wasn't that thin the best performance belongs to <UNK> <UNK> he had the most accurate <UNK> portrayal the problem with <UNK> character his hair is way too <UNK> and way too red i know that's too technical so i won't count that on my list of why i didn't like this movie br br back to <UNK> who just so happens to be my favorite <UNK> he is written as a whining <UNK> chicken true he had many <UNK> but he wasn't that bad he didn't leave the group initially because he was afraid of ted <UNK> although he didn't like him <UNK> left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldn't turn down instead of the truth this movie chooses to make him wet the bed on larry no less run into a closet and <UNK> bow out of the group another problem is that <UNK> made nearly as many columbia shorts as curly did as a <UNK> but only one fright night which was his first short is shown his career was almost completely ignored plus lousy editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error <UNK> was born in early <UNK> and died in late 1955 that would make him how old at death well here's a hint it's not <UNK> as the movie states br br now for the writing which i think was flawed only because this movie was rushed out some of the lines are dumb and could be developed and or introduced much better than they were the one line that really got me was at the very end of the film when moe is showing the <UNK> how the is done br br that's how we do it make contact with the brow bone not the eyes looks real on film though this line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film it's meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh in <UNK> and i'm sure it did with some people but the very end of the movie was not the place for this line a better place you ask how about when they show up at columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine i know initially there was no sound for the but moe for instance could have said what about this and curly or larry jules white then says are you okay or <UNK> you do that there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out another one involves the origin of the name <UNK> although that one isn't as bad and so i will let that one slide br br what does this film do well it illustrates how the stooges were screwed by columbia which they were i'm not sure if moe was an <UNK> boy but that was the kind of <UNK> stuff that is meant to get the viewer <UNK> with them i know this film was a <UNK> i know not everything is going to be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect however some of the stuff they made up and the real stuff that they ignored were in serious conflict with each other for instance <UNK> stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life i know i know <UNK> but the purpose of <UNK> is to make real events more dramatic <UNK> stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie here's what really happened curly was sitting in a chair off screen while a scene was being shot they called him for the final pie fight scene but there was no response moe went to go get him and discovered his little brother head <UNK> half <UNK> unable to speak and tears <UNK> down his face moe then said babe and tried to help him out of his chair poor curly drops to his knees then the <UNK> was called br br all in all this movie wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't good or even ok this film portrays the stooges <UNK> and <UNK> and sometimes goes overboard with <UNK> there is a very very long list of inaccuracies in this film if you don't believe me check out a <UNK> named <UNK> list at the com news forum it is about a page and a half long some things in the movie i can let slide but others were unforgivable the three stooges were geniuses and a lot of today's comedy is based off of what they did don't believe me check out the simpsons and more so <UNK> <UNK> but this film fails to capture their genius it more so <UNK> captures their <UNK> which is important but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges it has to portray their <UNK> and originality more than anything
<START> on one level <UNK> <UNK> is a film using a familiar genre the road movie to tell a familiar story curious <UNK> explores the mysterious east but at its heart the film is about two people a young french beauty bent on experiencing life to the <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> driver <UNK> <UNK> with bollywood aspirations from vastly different cultures their slowly growing attraction for each other and the beautiful mad chaos that is india today the gap between them can never be <UNK> but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without <UNK> the story's <UNK> india and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative and except for the main characters the roles are played beautifully and <UNK> by locals <UNK> during the film's production while on the road between the indian towns and <UNK> that form the film's setting one major negative for this viewer a <UNK> <UNK> chase near the film's conclusion as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bent on collecting a gambling debt but the closing scenes where and <UNK> <UNK> farewell are poignant and unforgettable
<START> this is a by the numbers horror film starring richard crenna and joanna <UNK> as a psychologist duo who purchase and old mansion and invite a small crew of friends and patients to help clean the place up <UNK> to them the mansion <UNK> a <UNK> door the <UNK> to hell if you are in the mood for a clichéd horror film then look no further but if you want something inventive then this little film won't appeal to you br br violence rather subdued albeit the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw rather gruesome mind you fans of inventive deaths scenes will not like this as every character seems to be <UNK> in some fashion br br nudity nothing to speak of mary louise <UNK> adds the good looks but her character was underdeveloped br br story cliched but view worthy nonetheless this offers nothing new to the genre but the casting of victor <UNK> who is about as menacing as a department store santa seems to have attracted a few viewers br br acting the best performances are by crenna and <UNK> with the other actors simply <UNK> in their roles the screenwriter fails to develop any characters outside character and seemed to have forgotten about mary louise <UNK> animal house who disappears for about twenty minutes and only <UNK> to be <UNK> like everyone else in boring fashion
<START> the stuff dreams are made of a complete retelling of the play as a dream of vengeance will <UNK> <UNK> but will delight the open minded a superb effort great cinematography acting and script 11 stars
<START> this movie has to be seen for the music which is actually a wonderful composed by <UNK> obviously the original soundtrack is not exactly hi fi but there are many excellent versions available in classical music <UNK> the can be appreciated for itself but having seen the movie helps br br the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti german propaganda an amusing <UNK> is that <UNK> was later so eager to buy time by <UNK> hitler at the <UNK> of world war ii that <UNK> was to a german movie for a short while as <UNK> br br prince alexander <UNK> <UNK> as a saint by the russian <UNK> having earned his <UNK> by <UNK> swedish <UNK> on the river <UNK> <UNK> russian resistance against an invasion by the <UNK> knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would be <UNK> br br an interesting scene alexander sees a <UNK> of russians being taken as slaves by <UNK> soldiers and does nothing to stop this as the <UNK> knights are his <UNK> the historical alexander <UNK> paid tribute to the <UNK> <UNK> as his father before him while working to <UNK> his future independence
<START> the discussion has been held a thousand times is the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> i think it is isn't it unfair to always point out this little bit of in an otherwise great piece of art i think it isn't does this play <UNK> shakespeare's reputation as the world's greatest playwright i think it does does it play a role if he didn't do it on a particular racist purpose i think it doesn't michael <UNK> knew all this and this is why he added to his movie a prologue about the pitiful situation of the jews in renaissance <UNK> br br in vain for the play remains what it has always been and the new make up only gives a first but <UNK> hope that someone has <UNK> to set something right that remains a permanent outrage not because its degree of would be particularly shocking but because the play comes under the name of william shakespeare br br why spend so much time in portraying the hatred of a man <UNK> why employ a great and serious actor like al pacino if in the end everything is getting ruined in this outrageous but hey i'm not responsible shakespeare wrote it court room scene and now i'd like to be very precise just like <UNK> himself br br he's demanding his right according to the contract which the not very responsible christian antonio who always used to look down on him signed in full awareness of the consequences sure what <UNK> demands is cruel and useless but that's not the point what we see or should see is a man who has been <UNK> for all his life to the point where all what remains on him is his hatred i think it is certainly a bit inappropriate to lecture such a man on things like compassion br br but what the play the movie they are one and the same now does at this point is become a soap opera the cruel madman with his knife the horrified but rather short minded audience the poor victim tied to his chair true antonio accepts his fate but why can't he just say one word sorry i think we need not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young from it's a truly popular verdict not much different from what would be seen 400 years later in the show trials of the nazis from one minute to the next this jew is robbed of everything he owned sentenced to being <UNK> christian and kicked out br br isn't that outrageous obviously not the story moves on to the romantic <UNK> of the rings and its happy end br br what one can learn in jewish museum in berlin and similar places all over the world is that often goes <UNK> by the mass because what's so devastating for a minority or some individuals is <UNK> in the alleged greater good for the majority it should be exactly the task of everyone of us to develop a sensitivity to <UNK> and <UNK> such <UNK> br br i don't accept the excuse that this film was made to create empathy with the badly treated <UNK> it just doesn't work out i don't think that anybody can be forced to be <UNK> br br i don't recommend this movie in particular not for an oscar
<START> tom is about to <UNK> into a delicious jerry <UNK> when a huge bird of prey <UNK> down and flies off with his <UNK> not at all happy with having his stolen right from under his nose tom takes off in hot pursuit determined to retrieve his <UNK> <UNK> br br as much as i love tom and jerry i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker the story is rather mundane it introduces a badly conceived <UNK> character that lacks charm and it <UNK> the old <UNK> the cartoon character up as a <UNK> gag to death br br in my opinion rivals <UNK> <UNK> and in <UNK> for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far
<START> do you know that they want to the moon for real and in there is the <UNK> project that could lead to make possible time machine all i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future at the time of the movie projects but real hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie now about the movie itself i saw the original movie too and i also read the book the book i didn't like though but the movie yes i totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing unlike the 60's one that was very good with force this one was only a future of what is good movie
<START> john has made two one man shows o <UNK> and freaks and neither one has shown up on dvd john why do you this to me john put it on dvd john so the people can see they need to see john d just in case <UNK> keeping a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> while not the first movie i've purchased for myself this is almost certainly the one i've watched the most the animation is well drawn by the experts at tokyo movie and the animators frequently made use of clever techniques such as having the sun cause lens <UNK> having the camera get <UNK> and having the camera hand clean the lens etc while the film avoided becoming a an <UNK> gadget fest the <UNK> but generous <UNK> of such techniques gave the film a much more realistic feel than the typical cartoon br br the story has many plots which don't seem to have much to do with each other until everything comes together at the end in a manner even the writers self <UNK> admit is contrived each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme ranging from pop goes the <UNK> <UNK> to the love theme from romeo and juliet <UNK> johnny the transitions between <UNK> are slightly varied but consistent br br truly a wonderful film there isn't much original music though the new lyrics to spinning song are clever and enjoyable highly recommended
<START> first at all if you like watching movies i recommend you not to watch this one why afterwards you won't appreciate any other movie so easily anymore br br actually i don't wanna give rise to any excessive expectations but it is almost frightening how perfect intense and beautiful this work of is when in most movies there is at least one aspect spoiling the whole thing like good actors but horrible dialogs or a nice scenery but low budget cinematography  in of the universe there is nothing of this <UNK> really everything is just great even and not least the soundtrack with the magnificent <UNK> br br in this story about <UNK> a student that goes <UNK> after being dumped by his girlfriend especially the dialogs and monologues deserve some attention together with and sometimes in sharp contrast to the plot they range from depressing and <UNK> to the whole opposite of comical and totally absurd what is more they are often with quotes from <UNK> and shakespeare of such a poetic beauty that the movie almost <UNK> into a surreal <UNK> and is only saved to the real world by its incredibly authentic actors br br one of the other comments was already referring to another point this movie is no trivial entertainment for relaxing in the evening despite of several comical <UNK> in between it is largely disturbing partly cynical and bitter and most of all sad it is a modern poetry about a life of insanity with all its <UNK> rage and <UNK> br br finally when you've seen the movie  watch it again there are some great visual <UNK> and <UNK> in it that you realize only when you look twice and connect them with the of the story and of course read the book it contains a lot more of the small funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a bit better
<START> after a <UNK> the roads are <UNK> and the highway <UNK> jason adam beach comes to the diner of his friend fritz <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> his <UNK> that they will only be able to follow their <UNK> on the next day among the weird strangers jason meets his former sweetheart nancy rose who has just left her husband in los angeles along the night without any communication with his base jason faces and suspicious situations with the <UNK> and finds some corpses <UNK> that among them there is a killer br br the last stop could be an average thriller but the screenplay is simply awful most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never <UNK> and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests my vote is four br br title brazil trapped
<START> i was very excited to see rock star because i am a big fan of mark <UNK> i was surprised to have liked it more than i originally thought i would the script did leave something to be desired but the movie's performances made up for it there were a few moments when visions of spinal tap came <UNK> back and i can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a <UNK> but i <UNK> br br <UNK> continues to demonstrate his talent as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true he does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him but also make you really care about his character br br jennifer aniston who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point is surprisingly good as the girlfriend manager she shows more real emotion than i've seen in her last few movies combined br br but above all it's the music in this movie that really draws you in <UNK> with some 80's tunes let's face it bon <UNK> would have any 80's music fans <UNK> in their seat the movie really rocks with the original steel dragon songs and <UNK> performance of them br br i plan to see this movie again but first i'm going to rush out and buy the soundtrack
<START> <UNK> into <UNK> arriving within this new wave of asian horror films following such hits like <UNK> <UNK> on and the eye two of them with remakes and much more coming like dark water and tale of two sisters falls short of the spooky supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a tim burton or david lynch kind of way but in a irrelevant and dull way br br its start with a girl some other kid with a crush on her her best friend and his dad who's obsessed with everything that happens concerns people die and you see so okay it'll go along with it i'm kinda <UNK> by <UNK> myself characters don't seem to go anywhere but i'll play along we find out the town is cursed by people start screaming at and the point is are everywhere the movie is a disaster it doesn't know where to go except to show you the power of there are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees on her <UNK> but then there's another scene where she hears her husband from beyond the grave tell her that she also has in her ear the way they handled that scene was just laughable not even cheesy fun there are also some a little bit of cool visuals like the collection the father has of and the girl with the hair yep hair its out of context though its seems like it was taken out of a fruit <UNK> commercial where if you eat an <UNK> <UNK> its taste is so incredible your hair turns into now if this wasn't bad enough suddenly out of nowhere there are <UNK> men or <UNK> and you know why right because in their <UNK> they have that only left time enough for a crappy anti climatic ending and by that time i was sick of <UNK> here there sure look around you how many can you if you want to see a movie about <UNK> go see <UNK> 3 now there you'll find some pretty cool concepts in between the meaning of life and dark city has also a little bit of a <UNK> thing in there br br this movie could have worked as a music video it has already garnered a cult following and thats why i was compelled to see it but after doing so i'm not sure why people think it's great i was truly disappointed
<START> a very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in new jersey the story characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball still it's worth watching especially for the strong images some still with me even though i first viewed this 25 years ago br br a young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things tries to but these things keep going wrong leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being <UNK> off not a good place to be if you enjoy your health or life br br this is the film that introduced joe <UNK> to martin scorsese also present is that <UNK> screen wise guy frank vincent strong on characterizations and visuals sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish but a great story
<START> <UNK> deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets it's a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography but <UNK> isn't just this one scene every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an <UNK> told moral tale that set the scene for film <UNK> for years to come br br <UNK> and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me it's the final scene that holds the most power tony le <UNK> drive towards redemption
<START> this is not great cinema the film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original carrie the parallels with the original film are striking but with an added <UNK> about the powers being <UNK> br br i can't say that i disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours but these were passed as one would read an <UNK> book on a long train journey that book would not be great literature but would <UNK> one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable at least i think it is i cant remember much about it now
<START> i paid 2 00 for this piece of crap i want my money back it is a d grade horror movie that isn't so <UNK> br br there are many many floors in this film including the acting the lack of actual horror the lack of nudity which besides the starting nurse porno outfit and the still breathing nude corpse flash there is none br br the sound track maybe is the best thing because it has some upbeat sorta guitar <UNK> tracks br br there are your usual typical characters the jock the <UNK> woman the nerdy guy who looks more like a jock the rookie cop ranger who has the biggest gap in his teeth i wanted to slip a few dollar <UNK> into that gap or go for a field goal the mysterious <UNK> and the pure girl br br the make up was pitiful with side views of dr <UNK> showing a clear make up line and natural skin tones the cover art to the dvd is clearly <UNK> enhanced to make the cover more <UNK> as dr <UNK> looks like an old the <UNK> women that hang around dr <UNK> are not explained and or look convincing like the rest of this movie br br the plot twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad looking fake limbs was laughable what did they think um throw some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror film br br dr <UNK> himself is the most stupid character created i've seen in a while though original i believe that the creator of this film was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the rhyme doctor and <UNK> bike and thought <UNK> ill make a crappy movie about that br br i've seen worse before but this is just plain bad everything about it is bad the lack of suspense the lack of actual horror or character development the lack of a decent storyline the only thing good about this film was when it finished this film doesn't fall into the category so bad its good for me either br br overall 2 10 the director writer editor should know better
<START> this is a great horror film for people who don't want all that vomit <UNK> gore and <UNK> this movie has equal amounts of horror suspense humor and even a little light nudity but nothing big <UNK> <UNK> isn't over the top as she was in return of the living dead where she <UNK> naked on a crypt but she is still essentially the same <UNK> character cathy is a <UNK> and <UNK> character before going on to dallas and we are also introduced to <UNK> soon <UNK> <UNK> the sexy and sinister would be dark <UNK> of the house as she and <UNK> are possessed and take over the house they <UNK> the bodies of their dead friends to scare the limits out of the survivors i've heard a lot of people compare this movie to the evil dead but if anything this movie is a rival to that one the same way <UNK> <UNK> jason this movie series though is far superior to that one
<START> american made final entry in the blood island series of <UNK> horror films concerns <UNK> <UNK> reed hadley <UNK> of a fictional country he dies of cancer yet it's figured out how to bring him back put his brain into a <UNK> body the mad doctor in charge kent taylor puts it in a highly unlikely body the <UNK> <UNK> giant <UNK> named <UNK> john bloom a doctor friend of the <UNK> tries to <UNK> matters and put an end to the mad plans br br film making partners samuel m <UNK> producer and al <UNK> director <UNK> several actors they've worked with before including taylor sexy wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they tried to go for the feel of the previous blood island entries but one can tell this was made <UNK> while not necessarily a good film it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an <UNK> trashy whole a <UNK> dwarf <UNK> gory <UNK> a rather unconvincing makeup job on bloom the political intrigue subplot <UNK> full of <UNK> etc the narrative is actually pretty coherent with plot twists thrown in here and there i think it could have been <UNK> a bit some scenes drag but it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect br br for this kind of thing the acting isn't too bad both taylor and <UNK> are fun the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role is appealing enough and williams is o k in the heroic role in any event it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films br br absolutely nothing special but as a trashy b horror i use the word loosely none of this is exactly scary film it certainly <UNK> br br 7 10
<START> susan slept here turned out to be dick <UNK> <UNK> song as a performer on the big screen of course he directed some more films and appeared frequently on television until he died it's a pity he didn't go out with his performance in the bad and the beautiful br br frank <UNK> has done so many better films i'm still not sure whatever possessed him to do this one the premise is absolutely laughable br br dick powell is a screenwriter who's looking to do more serious stuff than the fluff he's been writing he had an idea for a film on juvenile <UNK> so two friendly cops in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 17 year old debbie reynolds on his <UNK> she's not a really bad kid and they don't want to put her in the system so they give her to dick powell at christmas time br br i mean is there anyone out there who doesn't see a problem the term comes immediately to mind additionally powell has a girlfriend the young and sexy anne francis why debbie reynolds is any competition here is beyond me br br susan slept here got one oscar nomination the song hold my hand sung by don <UNK> in the background was nominated for best song but lost to secret love br br powell and reynolds do have some funny moments together and moore as <UNK> <UNK> and les <UNK> as his lawyer also get a few laughs br br but it's not enough
<START> <UNK> was one of the very first movies that gave positive role models for both black men and women i appreciated this movie even more as i got older this movie shows that men didn't always turn away from responsibility an excellent movie i'd always recommend for anyone who <UNK> a good inner city love story
<START> as a new resolution for this year 2005 i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater 10 or in dvd 90 br br i must admit that dvd have <UNK> this habit for instance i can hear the true voice of the cast which is an essential <UNK> of the personality in my country non french movies are dubbed and we end up with <UNK> french voice is terrible very far away of its original tone the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices br br and well if everybody found my comments well in 2006 i will stop my reviews ah ah so enjoy them now br br my summary means that the story locations cast is not very enjoyable br br only br br sandra <UNK> is there she is a talented actress able to get the viewer to catch on the movie br br it reminds of a feminine the fugitive so if you look for a moment of escaping your life watching this movie makes it worse because <UNK> life is a mess br br she got nothing left to hold on to only her poor mother who is ill again the touch for depression br br in fact she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie has a <UNK> life throughout it to finally get back to it at the end what a happy ending br br maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a <UNK> life br br very far away from the best computer movie of all time <UNK>
<START> native <UNK> son is <UNK> accused for the death of his father the evil witch doctor orders to <UNK> him he then comes back as a murdering tree well what can you say about such a film if it was intended to be a horror film there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved and for a comedy it still isn't funny enough i don't know why people make films like this i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it or you might want to see the incredible monstrous tree which gives a new dimension to a slow death or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved ms or the dialogue and screenplay which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year br br shouldn't we try psycho analysis on that tree maybe its mother was afraid of <UNK> 2 10
<START> oh dear oh dear what were they thinking of terrible script terrible acting i don't even feel sorry for the actors they took their <UNK> to the bank and <UNK> happily br br since when did an air <UNK> from <UNK> cross pop out at bank why are vehicles crossing tower bridge going in towards the city when the <UNK> hit why is tower bridge not crowded when the city is being <UNK> how does <UNK> dive into a raging <UNK> and survive i could go on and on br br there is no real sense of urgency in the command room they might just as well be waiting for the england eleven to come back onto the pitch after the tea <UNK> at <UNK> br br it says something when i <UNK> the to learn more about treatment with eager anticipation br br totally <UNK> trash
<START> the whole movie was done half <UNK> it could have been a much better movie but that would have required a re write and different actors compared to traffic this was a wreck i am just glad i didn't have to pay for it br br spoiler br br what was the point of having crooked cops getting arrested to share the guilt of drug dealers and make them feel better <UNK> the parents were <UNK> driven by greed and didn't even consider the harm they were doing as pointed out by ice t br br 2 out of 10
<START> warning spoilers br br five young people ignore the <UNK> of forest ranger george kennedy and <UNK> up to the misty <UNK> mountains where they are stalked and butchered by a pair of huge <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> twins when only two are left warren and his girl connie they resort back to their animal instincts to stay alive the film ends with connie <UNK> half of her arm down one of the <UNK> throats <UNK> him to death a very powerful if somewhat overrated backwoods slasher flick thats effective use of lighting sound and photography make it a cut above the usual friday the 13th cash in lead by an attractive likeable cast especially deborah benson where is she now and <UNK> henry this nifty companion piece to director jeff <UNK> 1976 and blue sunshine 1977 shouldn't be missed
<START> well i'm not the world's biggest <UNK> fan so although i have the cast album and i've listened to it a few times i've never actually seen this show performed and i haven't seen the tim burton movie version either i felt like i wanted to see something more faithful before i see the burton one and give it a chance just as a movie this version isn't a movie at all it's a filmed play with some of the original members of the cast including most importantly angela <UNK> performance as <UNK> <UNK> this is one of those performances that's just like a <UNK> into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself she must have had so much fun with this role <UNK> todd himself isn't played by <UNK> who did it originally but by george does a fantastic job his voice isn't quite as good as but he seems to play it a bit <UNK> br br the only problem i had really was with the <UNK> character as played by <UNK> <UNK> and to some extent her lover anthony as played by <UNK> voice can't sustain high notes but i wasn't entirely sure if that was maybe supposed to be the point since i'm not hugely familiar with this play more importantly i'm not sure if the story of <UNK> todd really holds up enough weight to sustain some of the music but thankfully the whole thing doesn't seem to have been taken too seriously by its creators as a <UNK> and a bit of comedy in the vein of grand <UNK> it's quite enjoyable i don't feel like it's as significant a piece of work as company and into the woods or some of his other shows some of the music is quite spectacular but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show br br i won't say a whole lot about it here because this is a film website and this is really not a film but just a play that has been shot on film there were maybe 3 or 4 scenes where they moved the camera around but that was it people will want to see this because it <UNK> <UNK> legendary performance which deserves its legendary status because it's a hilarious and insightful performance george can be proud of his version of <UNK> as well this would be a good film to show children over the age of 5 or so to get them interested in musicals because the blood and <UNK> will really surprise them seeing a performance filmed so expertly and so <UNK> makes me wish that more efforts like this had been made over the years with musical theater because i prefer shows from the <UNK> through the 50s to these later era affairs <UNK> todd is an exceptional show from its era however miles and miles above the al <UNK> madness
<START> c'mon let's put aside the <UNK> humor that we can find in racism and be honest it isn't funny i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so <UNK> to race relations and i'm not referring to the obvious black white commentary in the movie but to the <UNK> towards other <UNK> such as betty <UNK> characterizations of the <UNK> should we just <UNK> up her <UNK> to do this movie as a sign of <UNK> is she too old to <UNK> comedy from stereotypical trash or is it the fault of the writers how about the third assistant makeup person nope the fault is with us for <UNK> this kind of crap in the <UNK> of comedy that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter we're all different let's celebrate that diversity not poke fun at it and promote <UNK>
<START> i am not sure who is having more fun the people that wrote the reviews or the director of the movie i could not go any longer reading this comments or watching this movie i had to say something br br i can see a low budget western film that is done with passion and interest on the detail but using a garage with art <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> colors actors that seem to be falling sleep because the script is so boring and the boom getting on the way of the camera every two scenes that is definitely not my definition of one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium br br please if any of you guys had friends in the movie just say it
<START> this is better than the early <UNK> horror films but nothing more than your basic what is real story the <UNK> theme has been told before too nothing original is left except the weird <UNK> atmosphere which is not that strong here with the amusing sexual references and <UNK> dark score the story never grabs your full attention it just flows forward event after event with boring pace rating 4 10
<START> i think <UNK> needs to be off the air and end the reality show once and for all i don't care what anyone says you can attack me or agree with me but its times like this that the show is just <UNK> out propaganda and the host of <UNK> joey <UNK> is a little bastard who wants to think that showing people on camera is effective and <UNK> no it just will show disgusting he is also the <UNK> and following of people by <UNK> <UNK> is illegal and a federal offense we are living in a police state like the soviet union and nazi germany rolled into one i am happy that there is poor reviews on this trash this needs to end soon or we are going to lose our liberties as a nation no wonder our country is going to hell its because of this and other filth shows i liked the older shows better from the 1950s 1980s i hope you all agree with me on that thank you
<START> the only reason the duke is tops one of several race movies made during the times of <UNK> would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a 21 year old singer named lena <UNK> she plays <UNK> andrews a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis ralph cooper in order to branch into the big time davis however has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she won't feel sorry for having done so he then teams up with doc lawrence for a series of medicine shows throughout the south meanwhile in new york her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the <UNK> act davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his <UNK> of other <UNK> acts many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here for his chance at the big time with <UNK> next to him guess what happens while the plot is the kind you've seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features i've seen during this black history month ms <UNK> singing is on good display here and it's interesting seeing her so young before her <UNK> takes full hold later in her career among other supporting players there's an <UNK> according to imdb appearance by <UNK> randolph annie in my favorite movie it's a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network as the woman with who complains of not being <UNK> after taking the <UNK> medicine before duke explains it's for the feet and as a longtime <UNK> resident i'd like to take note of two players from here in this movie joel from monroe as a <UNK> <UNK> and marie <UNK> from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax so for just lena <UNK> alone the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once
<START> <UNK> <UNK> isn't a film it's a <UNK> this nauseating <UNK> and almost <UNK> tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few <UNK> from george burns plays a little girl who is asked by <UNK> god to <UNK> an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again no really that is the story it's a <UNK> load of old <UNK> that has far too much self <UNK> religious <UNK> but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> this ain't suzanne <UNK> <UNK> a bit of life into this <UNK> <UNK> of quick setting <UNK> but the <UNK> headed script and rubbish performance by the <UNK> quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you know where
<START> the book the <UNK> children is a children's book published in <UNK> by edith an early british <UNK> who had very strong views about the importance of family values for the upbringing of children and the story it told was presumably intended to be contemporary somewhat surprisingly it seems to retain a significant appeal for today's children a hundred years later br br a film adaptation of an <UNK> classic children's story with the principal roles those of the children does not sound very exciting to most film goers in this day and age but a really great performance by jenny <UNK> who near the start of her long and distinguished acting career played the part of the oldest girl <UNK> bobby combined with remarkable work by the script writer and director lionel <UNK> and outstanding photography by arthur have made this a film that is still not to be missed and one which most of its viewers find quite memorable it is remarkable that this book set in the year <UNK> was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 four of them by the bbc for british television and all of these versions are not only still greatly admired but also very highly regarded something that user comments on this <UNK> will confirm even though this may seem almost <UNK> for a nostalgic period story designed to appeal primarily to children since i have not seen the four bbc tv versions these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 film version produced for showing in cinemas unlike most films of children's books 'the <UNK> <UNK> may appeal more to adults than to children the structure of family life has changed so much in the last century that many children may feel totally lost by the way in which it is depicted in the film whereas many older adults may find it has a considerable nostalgic appeal perhaps <UNK> for this the children featured in the film are full of life and <UNK> whilst the adult characters although well rounded tend to mostly be the story is a mature one which deals with love support and <UNK> it is not only timeless but capable of appealing to all ages it can fairly be described as sentimental and more than a little <UNK> but it is never in any way <UNK> and that rarely justified <UNK> fits it like a <UNK> br br spoiler ahead br br the film starts with its upper middle class <UNK> family celebrating christmas in a comfortable and fairly <UNK> london home when two unexpected <UNK> call and take father who is a senior government officer away with them mother has to move to a very small <UNK> alongside the <UNK> in a remote part of <UNK> and the children gradually build a new life mainly associated with the <UNK> and the few trains that pass this life proves quite <UNK> in small ways and the elder daughter bobby grows up rapidly as she takes over more <UNK> from her mother at one point she an accident to the train when her sharp eyes spot that a <UNK> has created a natural <UNK> father's story is never given much emphasis but he is never forgotten and it gradually becomes apparent that he is <UNK> and suspected of <UNK> finally these <UNK> are <UNK> up we are not told how or why and he <UNK> unexpectedly at the local station to <UNK> his family br br for many years this film was not available in any home video format in north america but anchor bay created a dvd from it three years ago so they clearly <UNK> that this quite simple film has not yet lost its appeal for anyone who has not got one already i would very strongly recommend <UNK> out to buy a copy of this dvd whilst it is still available you would be most unlikely to be disappointed unless you have become totally cynical or your minimum <UNK> for a film include <UNK> of blood and or intense sex scenes
<START> although it isn't half as hilarious as chicken run the new wallace and <UNK> comedy the curse of the were rabbit out of <UNK> more laughs than most live action comedies british director nick park who created the wallace and <UNK> characters and co director steve box rely on the old fashioned stop motion method of animation known best as <UNK> to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side splitting scenes about a <UNK> mutant <UNK> out to <UNK> every <UNK> in sight amusing as its whimsical storyline is the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which park and company have <UNK> constructed characters and gags out of a brand of <UNK> clay called <UNK> basically every shot that you see in the curse of the were rabbit required patient souls that made minor <UNK> in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that <UNK> into a <UNK> montage of <UNK> hollywood <UNK> <UNK> as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s before the industry turned its back on the complicated process <UNK> studio animators managed to <UNK> out a mere three seconds of <UNK> footage per day for the record the curse of the were rabbit took five years to make the <UNK> looking characters with thumb <UNK> clearly visible in their respective clay <UNK> look incredibly funny with their <UNK> <UNK> ball eyes and over biting mouths interestingly <UNK> emerges as the funniest character a lovable <UNK> with no mouth but an <UNK> <UNK> face who says more than most of the talking characters br br wallace and <UNK> are respectively master and <UNK> as the human half of the duo wallace is a looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to <UNK> machines that do some rather incredible things one of the funnier scenes shows master and <UNK> <UNK> by a system of <UNK> and spring <UNK> <UNK> that dress and feed them meanwhile <UNK> is the animal half the running joke is that <UNK> shows more common sense than his genius of a master as good as his ideas and <UNK> are wallace could not succeed without the loyal <UNK> giving him a hand our heroes run a <UNK> protection business called <UNK> ' essentially they must protect every <UNK> <UNK> for miles around using an <UNK> looking device called a <UNK> van <UNK> that literally sucks <UNK> out of their ground and into a huge glass <UNK> no wallace and <UNK> don't kill the <UNK> instead they keep them as pets and wallace experiments with an o <UNK> designed to <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> this frankenstein meets the fly approach <UNK> poor wallace into deep trouble when he <UNK> bits of his brain with that of a rabbit not long thereafter a mysterious <UNK> terror stalks the <UNK> <UNK> on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> contest approaches br br initially wallace and <UNK> appeared in <UNK> oscar nominated film school project a grand day out 1989 since then <UNK> has released ten other animated shorts among them wallace and <UNK> a close <UNK> 1993 and the oscar winning wallace and <UNK> the wrong <UNK> 1995 curse of the were rabbit <UNK> not only because it represents the <UNK> big screen debut but also it runs a <UNK> 85 minutes the first two thirds of were rabbit contain better gags than the last third but park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won't get but <UNK> grown ups will appreciate wallace and <UNK> the curse of the were rabbit is <UNK> raising fun
<START> art <UNK> life <UNK> art <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> into the d a in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who done it and how did it happen the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work <UNK> integrity and <UNK> with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again the music is driving but not <UNK> the pacing and visuals are such that there is no <UNK> the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience
<START> <UNK> <UNK> directs three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world in one of them is a sort of operatic <UNK> story where a rejected architect attempts to manipulate a group of people into <UNK> of happiness only his attempt misses it's only real target the woman that he <UNK> after in the same unfinished <UNK> he built a group of teachers search for love in a more modern story as one woman believes <UNK> in the role of romance and the cynical tries to teach her a lesson by setting her up with the biggest jerk in the group meanwhile a bunch of kids <UNK> a george <UNK> like adventure of a prince that saves a girl in distress from swamp creatures and then kills the evil king bringing upon the kingdom of love the two primary themes life is a fairy tale and life isn't a fairy tale br br which sounds better than the movie actually is <UNK> is the type of director where <UNK> the concept is good or bad but the exposition is what matters here the concept is great but the movie is downright painful to watch <UNK> off tune songs <UNK> characters without an ounce of dimension backdrops of sickening <UNK> instead of giving your inner child an ice cream <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it in a bucket of cake <UNK> add some french philosophy and you get a weird witches <UNK> one that doesn't bubble bubble <UNK> and trouble but just kinda sits wrong in your stomach until you want to <UNK> it br br <UNK> is a risk taking director and even in his worst you can see he's trying something that might not work with full clarity of action in i want to go home he manages to pull past annoying characters and <UNK> set pieces by showing some real change and having a moment few moments of quiet to catch his breath here he <UNK> directly into a fantasy that doesn't really reflect fantasy only its <UNK> room <UNK> reference the biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie more flamboyant than an 80s pop video and more <UNK> than golden era hollywood musicals the fantasies are beyond childish and naive but the movie with nudity and profanity is definitely aimed for adults a target he decidedly missed br br however he sticks closely to his theme and never if anything this movie is impressive simply because its <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> i <UNK> with the plight of the first man we see killed in this episode he reminded me of the <UNK> associated with being a lone security guard at night somewhere the type of work i did briefly about 20 years ago of course i was never in danger of being burned to a crisp as the colony chief lynch is fond of describing the monster in the dark here murdering members of a deep mining colony creates a scary impression in the first act we don't really see it in the early scenes and as many of us realize the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination <UNK> and is one voiced description but it actually turns out to resemble a big <UNK> <UNK> pizza along the ground like a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of the show's budget unfortunately this also shows in the latest <UNK> painting famous to trek fans the only way to convey a long shot of the mining <UNK> br br but the whole theme of this episode is about what's on the inside rather than <UNK> appearances anyway sure this a newly discovered <UNK> based life form looks like a mindless monster at first glance thanks to <UNK> <UNK> ability probably the best use of a <UNK> mind <UNK> for plot purposes we learn it's a highly intelligent even sophisticated creature besides <UNK> <UNK> use of his talent mccoy gets to his usual medical routine healing a creature resembling rocks or <UNK> he also gets to utter one of his most famous lines i'm a doctor not a <UNK> i found it very true to life in his scene where he in his success though he's unable to get kirk to share in his enthusiasm <UNK> too busy <UNK> results the episode throws unexpected turns in character motivation at the audience as the story progresses spock <UNK> the need to possibly <UNK> this discovered life as kirk takes his usual stand on <UNK> the deaths of any red shirts no half <UNK> as in the man trap but later it's kirk who for some reason holds back on firing a killing blast as if the heat of the hunt had worn off and he'd had time to reflect on <UNK> point i believe it was during this <UNK> filming that shatner learned his father had died <UNK> for most of the first season this has a happy ending the conflict <UNK> from the needs of basic capitalism such as meeting standard <UNK> versus protecting the natural environment and its inhabitants a space age version of protecting <UNK> from the <UNK> of modern <UNK> somehow despite many killings and a sense that everything could go to hell at any moment with one raised kirk and spock manage to <UNK> an <UNK> which <UNK> everyone i guess people and are more reasonable in the <UNK> century
<START> assault on <UNK> 13 is the absolute dumbest film i've seen since charlie's angels 2 the shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with br br spoilers i know they've said this movie is a remake <UNK> of <UNK> bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch <UNK> bravo besides the fact that <UNK> bravo is a western classic the premise of the film was that the sheriff john wayne had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being <UNK> by his brother and his gang no one wants to <UNK> anyone in assault on <UNK> 13 they want everyone dead so my first question would have to be why not just burn the whole place down from the start why assault the place at all i know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and or was presented properly if the veteran cop was in on it from the start why the need for this whole movie if the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege how did he even get the chance as soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point it's all just <UNK> br br what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police <UNK> complete with <UNK> and massive explosions but no one notices however as soon as there's a fire they have to leave before the fire department shows up how did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside police issue bullets in the walls bullet <UNK> <UNK> equipment usage and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of <UNK> men to be found how about those police <UNK> how could they possibly miss so badly so often i like the fact that when the two tried to run the <UNK> were <UNK> by two tiny <UNK> of snow as if it's not possible to shoot a high powered through a pile of snow br br the set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely no reason at all i know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one that particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt the conclusion remains <UNK> stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an austin powers like <UNK> instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured i know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of detroit city <UNK> but why did <UNK> character just wander off in to the woods in the first place he doesn't even look to see if the <UNK> with the secretary and his friend gets away they just cut to him <UNK> slowly in the woods pistol in hand i could go on but won't all i can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost
<START> just finished watching this movie i couldn't imagine watching this on vhs as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect even though the scene itself was in english br br visually the movie is pretty appealing the few cg effects were very obvious but the <UNK> creature effects weren't bad not perfect but photography and editing which were pretty good made up for a lot acting was generally bad though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldn't say having never seen any of the actors before the exception i think was m <UNK> she stole every scene she had a part in and not just because of a very pretty face but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had the writing could have been a lot better the plot was still <UNK> <UNK> and plenty of <UNK> details were written in but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue
<START> i don't know what it is exactly but the film is happily sitting on my shelf with no thought of ever leaving me fulci has crafted one of the most ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and well unique movies i've ever seen not sure what else to say about it but i love this movie the <UNK> scene is absolutely <UNK> and the whole nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious i'm not sure what fulci was trying to do but has anyone heard that based on this film fulci accused wes craven of ripping him off with scream cat in the brain is a must for bad movie lovers everywhere yes i'll definitely say it's not a good film but i guarantee certain scenes will stick in your mind forever this is an exercise in <UNK> people i guess if i were a serious critic i'd give it a 3 but on sheer <UNK> again i can't really explain my affections i'd give it a 7 really whacked out flick
<START> <UNK> of satan is one of the most underrated horror films of all times why it hasn't achieved a cult status is beyond me this is a chilling tale of terror and witchcraft which contains one of the most powerful and disturbing <UNK> in the <UNK> of screen horror in the small american town some children have disappeared and their parents been violently murdered what is the cause of <UNK> the film is really eerie some scenes are genuinely unnerving and definitely not easily forgotten the suspense never lets up the acting is really good and the climax is bizarre and disturbing check out this forgotten gem of satanic horror absolutely recommended
<START> i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip off cinema especially jaws rip offs but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark isn't very good all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema <UNK> <UNK> in the director's chair one of the best ridiculous cult actors michael taking the lead role and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale the fact that the <UNK> doesn't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida or rather somewhere in italy where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing it's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before and it's up to a <UNK> crew of various sea experts to catch it alive br br the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant although the fun element of films such as 'the last and <UNK> <UNK> is unfortunately absent for most of the running time the thing i love about lead actor michael is that he always seems like he's taking himself seriously no matter what film he's in although he only ever made four this is certainly the case here although <UNK> never really allows him to completely dive in and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters american <UNK> and it's not very fascinating although <UNK> does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining <UNK> of action as the central monster finally gets to <UNK> havoc upon its would be <UNK> overall there really isn't much to recommend this film for as mentioned i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions for hardcore italian horror fans only
<START> story wise this isn't among the best or most cleverly written columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made with excellent directing and truly fine acting br br especially the acting within this movie <UNK> the attention director nicholas did a great job with the actors in the movie <UNK> he allowed peter falk and john cassavetes lots of space to play with also since both are being credited on here as uncredited directors of this movie must be part of his directing style to allow the actors this much room it works out extremely well for this movie perhaps he did this because himself also used to work as an actor he is perhaps best known for playing the role of coach in the hit series cheers from the very start of it in 1982 until his death in 1985 br br so peter falk seems better than ever before in his role as lt columbo also veteran actor john cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant beside them the movie also features myrna loy a big star from the silent movie era and also pat <UNK> in a small early role br br but not just the acting directing within the movie is real good visually and technically it's also a really great made movie with slow long shots without the use of any cuts also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most columbo movies it really takes its time to set up things and tell its story the movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots of course all really fitting for the <UNK> br br but like i said before story wise this just isn't among the best columbo movies also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time it makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb like he didn't thought his plan over good enough while the character obviously is an intelligent man columbo this time also tries to <UNK> the suspect and other characters a bit more than he usually tries to do in order to solve the crime this and peter <UNK> different acting approach are a reason why his character might come across as different than he does in other columbo movies but different does not mean worse in this case br br the movie also features a quite good musical score by richard who after this became sort of the steady composer for the columbo movies br br a great columbo movie to watch br br 8 10
<START> i was only <UNK> <UNK> when renting all the boys love mandy lane as i instantly remembered hearing reading a wide variety of opinions  both positive and negative  in the short period of time between its brief cinematic release and the distribution towards <UNK> shelves supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years with non stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable plot twists for a change okay the basic concept may perhaps sound reasonably innovative but inevitably the screenplay quickly <UNK> to the same old and irritating slasher clichés and once passed that point even the nifty <UNK> <UNK> can't save the film from dreadful mediocrity the opening sequences are indeed terrific and literally bath in a <UNK> <UNK> ambiance which actually makes it all the more painful to witness the film sink towards the ordinary level of <UNK> slasher flick after the sublime intro <UNK> a drunk macho kid <UNK> his jump off a <UNK> in order to impress the titular beauty all the boys love mandy lane turns out to be just another <UNK> and uninspired horror movie about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before getting killed off by a not so <UNK> maniac the film's entire pretentious set up <UNK> faster than a <UNK> house of cards we never get a proper explanation why mandy herself behaves so <UNK> and <UNK> towards all her <UNK> because she grew up an orphan perhaps oh boo <UNK> the boys soon enough illustrate they'd settle for sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with the divine mandy and the final twist  albeit undeniably offbeat  is just plain senseless the middle section of is rather boring and doesn't even offer any genuinely horrific excitement shotgun killings please or authentic <UNK> sleaze my generous rating 4 out of 10 entirely goes to the grainy and unsettling 70's filming style with faded colors bizarre but beautiful <UNK> and the surprisingly marvelous soundtrack director jonathan <UNK> <UNK> for the classic bobby song sealed with a kiss to play during the trailer and end credits whereas i initially was convinced the film would inevitably feature barry cheesy love song mandy
<START> pink <UNK> a representation of <UNK> past br br pink <UNK> a film directed by john waters in 1972 is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life <UNK> johnson grew up in a very non typical home blatantly you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she <UNK> dog <UNK> was this film just some sick and twisted <UNK> of endless gut wrenching <UNK> or was it symbolic of something much deeper to side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented but possibly true the film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past every leader that we as people view as displays similar characteristics to those of <UNK> johnson <UNK> the terrible <UNK> khan <UNK> hitler and joseph all had <UNK> <UNK> johnson had a <UNK> childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned <UNK> that is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing however were her actions her own fault or <UNK> for letting her grow up the way she did furthermore each character in this film represents either a past leader or event another coincidence is <UNK> obsession with eggs with an open mind this can be tied into the <UNK> and hitler's attempt to <UNK> the jews some view hitler as a genius others a mad man john waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation edith was indeed mentally ill <UNK> son <UNK> and traveling companion <UNK> are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard slavery both names are <UNK> terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget <UNK> characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times our society in america was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social <UNK> in other cultures the chicken f king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong chicken is a 1970's <UNK> term for woman therefore it might be possible that john waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through <UNK> and <UNK> actions the antagonist family if a single antagonist can be determined in this film was the <UNK> is often mentioned in association with wealth therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever pink <UNK> is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its <UNK> political agenda that waters displayed so throughout its entirety
<START> european films may be slower paced and less plot driven than american films but this takes it way too far it also show a whole bunch of drawn characters doing inexplicable things it's not fantasy it's not even surreal it's just awkward and bad br br what's the message here that people in france are <UNK> and <UNK> a lot that they like to watch other people having sex they they <UNK> scream or touch a stranger on his neck do not wear a watch when seeing this film as you will be <UNK> at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time br br this is the story of a police <UNK> who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl though actually he seems troubled before then he is not merely upset at his own personal <UNK> but apparently mentally quite slow behaving very much like a learning disabled six year old child he stares <UNK> a lot walks with arms rigid like a little kid speaks in meek <UNK> tones behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions though no one seems to notice or care even when it is supposed to be police business he's not a troubled cop more of an picture andy <UNK> character on taxi but without the humor he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the <UNK> who scripted this thing the plot is clearly secondary do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered this not that important though the <UNK> of their behavior is sort of insulting the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either that leaves the long lingering close ups of fields <UNK> gardens people's faces etc the ending struck me as especially ridiculous totally <UNK> by the events leading up to it unless you think what's the worst way this film could end br br there is lots of sex and nudity which is supposed to mean something you want <UNK> you'll see <UNK> not to worry it's art it has deep meaning what i am not sure and the protagonist despite his innocent weirdness seems to have some sort of <UNK> neck or fetish br br finally the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background very hard to read many of them on the other hand there isn't much dialogue so this isn't a big problem there is also very little sound not even <UNK> sounds you would expect to hear in the film <UNK> to the <UNK> of the whole experience the old woody allen would have had a field day <UNK> this work br br that this is an award winning film is sad i would hate to see the losing films br br enjoy
<START> yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of <UNK> japanese films made before 1970 fires on the plain 1959 is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to and <UNK> all of these <UNK> who have such horrible taste in film it's still nearly impossible to <UNK> why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be <UNK> as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making <UNK> <UNK> standards like <UNK> acting camera work etc yet it always seems like the most highly <UNK> classics are most <UNK> in these very standards for example one of the <UNK> for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this <UNK> <UNK> to the extreme br br after a funny head slap the following useless dialogue <UNK> the viewer why can't you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to <UNK> <UNK> at we lost two thirds of our men our <UNK> was sunk in <UNK> we tried to reach <UNK> by crossing the central mountains but without <UNK> it was impossible the <UNK> <UNK> forced a across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah that's right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what <UNK> here br br such instances of poor quality movie making are <UNK> throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by <UNK> for <UNK> for example the lead character stumbles upon some <UNK> wrapped in japanese <UNK> instead of doing the natural thing like  oh i don't know  giving a depressed <UNK> the character <UNK> out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myself br br even worse this movie is <UNK> with over dramatic <UNK> the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the <UNK> boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape  a fact that is already clearly <UNK> with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous <UNK> super worn boots and notices  get ready cause here it comes  that his boots are super <UNK> worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super <UNK> worn boots behind but you see that's not all  because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super <UNK> worn boots and <UNK> them along with his own super <UNK> worn boots since both <UNK> suck he <UNK> them both aside and smiles as he continues <UNK> at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy <UNK> and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film making it's super <UNK> bad film making br br there are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket i'll also be the first to <UNK> the <UNK> performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential <UNK> for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head <UNK> back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his face br br the fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of 8 4 while a <UNK> masterpiece like a tale of two sisters 2003 only gets a 7 5 is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually <UNK> themselves into thinking that doesn't make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super <UNK> worn boots on its side

<START> this tv adaptation of sarah <UNK> novel was so lovingly done i can hardly find the words to appreciate it not since <UNK> the <UNK> also highly recommended have i seen such a performance by the lead actresses this time by sally <UNK> and <UNK> cassidy they acted with their souls and this is what gets across to the audience the supporting actors were well chosen too they made a great ensemble br br for those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship no this is only one part the other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love and the plot has some further surprising twists so the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me as well
<START> i'd first heard of this show in 2005 first online and then by viewing and of course buying the typically gorgeous bbc tie in book then i got the dvd it did not disappoint i'd been hoping for years someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the thrill of discovery rather than aliens laser gun fights and other hollywood gimmicks thank you joe also for your dr who work and the mini series not the crap movie of the same name what compelled me to write this now 2 <UNK> later was that i'd just seen sunshine last night and what appeared to be in the same family as space odyssey turned into about 2 <UNK> of the way in freddy krueger meets <UNK> that was when space odyssey really stood out as a positive example of how to do a real science fiction film more science less fiction odyssey like sunshine also dealt with astronaut shortcomings failed eva over on <UNK> the <UNK> with mission control and the sheer danger of exploring new planets with unfamiliar dangers the fatal radiation spike on mars i would've easily paid to see this in a theater i max anyone and to top it all not only were the space <UNK> jaw <UNK> beautiful but the characters were nicely drawn too i found their interplay more realistic than the wall <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> 2 crew <UNK> dumb name for a <UNK> mission did anyone read the mythology of <UNK> sometimes it takes a not so good film to <UNK> one to re watch a better film as an <UNK> astronaut i'd trade my passage on <UNK> for a seat on <UNK> any day in all fairness however the visuals of sunshine are quite stunning though and quite memorable which is why i was so strongly rooting for it to succeed as an honest to goodness sci fi film so even though this review is almost a back door review of sunshine i hope it's read for what it was meant to be strong support for a bbc <UNK> that succeeds where most big budget <UNK> cinematic <UNK> fail space odyssey a k a voyage to the planets here in the states the <UNK> for solid science fiction and delivers a <UNK> i very much enjoyed the pseudo documentary approach as well as for the time <UNK> light speed <UNK> they are addressed if you pay attention where sunshine <UNK> odyssey keeps its cool if you're considering going to the movies for another dose of sunshine stay in go for a true space odyssey instead
<START> yesterday i watched this tv production and i was very disappointed br br i didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending i felt it lasted for 3 hours but it was just me who was bored to death every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the turn off switch br br the movie is about a doctor dr who gets a lot of aids patients and most of them die during the movie it is hard for to live with so his family gets <UNK> with his <UNK> however this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we don't get much the difficulties to show more than one part of life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from andrews a man i hopefully can't see in any good future movies br br i believe it got 7 6 because of the subject taboo but i'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 3 10 br br
<START> to experience head you really need to understand where the <UNK> were when they filmed it br br this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up their inventive and comedic series sort of an american idol of their day took four unknown actors and formed a <UNK> around them br br this is their take on their <UNK> image and status as the 2nd <UNK> beatles they always felt they were in a box trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents br br it is also a hell of a musical <UNK> inventive i have the soundtrack and full of surprises br br see it with an open mind
<START> when this movie was made in 1980 i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience this was done at <UNK> the big letters spelling out at the top of the stands were covered up with a <UNK> in the movie the director would tell us to cheer <UNK> at certain points as if a <UNK> was being made st charles juvenile <UNK> center is a real place less than 30 miles from although i think it may have closed down recently during one scene they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game right below them you can see my sister head she was 11 at the time in the vhs version i can only see the top of her head but when i saw it on tv in 1981 i could see her whole head and my sister <UNK> as well br br i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie since there's already a description of the movie here i need not repeat it it's worth seeing at least once
<START> several weeks back i lost my beloved companion and friend of <UNK> years a golden <UNK> named <UNK> when i came home from the animal hospital alone after having made one of the most painful decisions of my life my teenage daughter sat by my side and we talked about this episode of the twilight zone i could be wrong but i recall a line that arthur <UNK> said when satan was trying to trick him into hell but his dog could not go with him and his dog in turn was <UNK> in <UNK> at the <UNK> who was trying to trick the old hunter to step inside that it would be one <UNK> of heaven if dogs were not allowed and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate of what they had thought was heaven to wander eternity alone what a <UNK> moment when they meet a good <UNK> country boy on that eternal road only to discover he is an angel sent out to find 'em and sure neighbor of course dogs are allowed into heaven br br i'll confess i cried as i talked about this with my daughter while we <UNK> the passing of our beloved golden rod <UNK> was truly a genius a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism hatred know and was a profound inspiration to me to become a writer this episode across forty five years carried a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend i urge you to get a copy the next time there is a one of the twilight zone <UNK> or purchase it there will be some tears but comfort as well as always thanks rod for all that you taught us even now
<START> anyone remember the <UNK> threads it's a drama documentary which shocked britain in september 1984 whilst not exactly wholly entertained by mick jackson's nuclear holocaust horror film i could respect it unfortunately i can't respect this <UNK> broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a <UNK> dirty bomb in the centre of london br br the problem i have with it is that director daniel <UNK> production values are far too good when in fact this would have <UNK> from rather cheap production values the cinematography is superb but in this type of <UNK> drama do we need superb and well lit oscar standard cinematography what we certainly don't need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly <UNK> out of the smoke neither do we need vaguely well known cast members did anyone else sit there asking themselves hey what was he in i know that face several times i know i did and it's very distracting br br perhaps the biggest production flaw with dirty war is that someone decided to make it a <UNK> with too much <UNK> emphasis on the drama in threads the action cuts away from the action in <UNK> <UNK> times and becomes an edition of horizon on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and threads is very effective because of this here the information presented <UNK> the drama which <UNK> in <UNK> and totally unconvincing dialogue the characters in the <UNK> aren't really characters they're just <UNK> there to inform the audience what happens when <UNK> material is <UNK> it would have been better for the action to cut to <UNK> to convey this type of information ala threads the worse thing is that director daniel <UNK> used the same technique as seen in threads a couple of years ago with his <UNK> about <UNK> he should have used the same style with dirty war br br i should also lay my cards on the table and state that while i don't consider most muslims are terrorists i am getting slightly fed up of tv productions like the <UNK> cell the <UNK> and dirty war having to point out this fact to me by me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of <UNK> pc attitudes in tv companies nowadays br br i managed to miss the studio debate that bob mentions here but i have also heard it discussed elsewhere and i can't help thinking it makes better viewing than dirty war itself with its <UNK> arguments between <UNK> <UNK> of the political spectrum if dirty war is remembered twenty years from now highly unlikely i know it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything
<START> i saw this stage show when it was broadcast on <UNK> in 1983 i was involved in local theatre at the time and had seen some pretty incredible stuff out of the <UNK> <UNK> players but bill irwin <UNK> me br br i was most impressed at how a man of his size he's quite tall and <UNK> could <UNK> himself up into a small box without so much as a pause for <UNK> and move across the stage at a dead run without even a <UNK> of sound from his feet if he chose not to make any noise br br most amazing for me though in this performance was the way he rose to his feet during the jack in the box <UNK> piece those who saw this show will recall that when he <UNK> from the box and <UNK> to the floor with his body limp and limbs <UNK> he pulled himself up by the top of his head as if by a string and rose not just to his feet but to a full ballet did it in one fluid seemingly <UNK> motion just consider the strength grace balance and focus such a series of movements must take in order to accomplish them the way he did add to his physical <UNK> his strong and believable characterization skills and there lies a <UNK> actor performer my jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke at the portrayal of a puppet who is determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box br br as to the unfortunate tragic would be a better word of this piece in home media form i have noticed that much of <UNK> works are not available on tape or dvd sometimes <UNK> shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately following a broadcast but they seldom stay on the market for long there are exceptions of course but these are mainly the science and history documentaries rarely does an arts piece remain in print for it ever made it into vhs dvd to begin with i don't know why this should be so certainly <UNK> could use the <UNK> from home media marketing of their shows but they don't take advantage of it much this is a shame there are many things i've watched on <UNK> that i wish to own but pieces such as the regard of flight are i'm afraid a one shot once in a lifetime treat never to be repeated on <UNK> again and never to be available for home media purchase that really sucks i'm lucky to have caught it when i did br br oh local library did get a copy of the regard of flight and was stolen
<START> this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen i say this without <UNK> and believe me i've seen a lot of bad movies it's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds thousands of spent so much time working on what the writers and producers must have known would be a <UNK> failure br br when a 90 minute film feels this long drawn out boring and incomprehensible you know that something went wrong somewhere also jamie kennedy whose work i've enjoyed elsewhere is simply terrible in this role he was obviously never given a screen test because no producer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in any way especially in the <UNK> of the mask simply awful br br personally i can't wait to see the reviews by the major film critics because i know they're do a better job than me at <UNK> this train wreck to <UNK> br br the producers of this film should be embarrassed and more importantly never be allowed to make theatrical films again
<START> this is without doubt the worst film in the hamilton saga and the worst actor to do carl hamilton peter <UNK> just cant pull it off with his psychotic looks and no style at all he may be good to do killers and psychotic <UNK> like in <UNK> or <UNK> but in this type of roles he is just useless br br lena <UNK> presence did no use for this film she <UNK> save it from being what it is an <UNK> copy of big budget action movies like <UNK> die hard 3 broken arrow etc this film has nothing swedish in it but the actors its clear that some <UNK> director with as model director has made this br br mark <UNK> presence is only laughable 2 out of 10
<START> hey the grudge 2 what up man i have a friend i would like you to meet the grudge 2 meet <UNK> worst of 2006 list <UNK> worst of 2006 list meet the grudge 2 br br what's going on here i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake if that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original this <UNK> doesn't even feel like a movie it's just a 90 minute soundtrack of the weird chick making that annoying <UNK> sound br br a sound on which i'd recommend you not get me started it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it but i've heard it about 12 times since 2004 so it's pretty much run its course and it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie sigh br br folks you're not funny so just shut up i promise you every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room which is approximately <UNK> of the movie somebody in the audience would start it up yes i know that's a horrible way to <UNK> the sound with letters but you get the <UNK> so then some dude in the audience would giggle and not to be <UNK> deliver his own rendition i was very close to just walking through the audience and <UNK> random people br br i told you not to get me started br br there's absolutely nothing about the grudge 2 that i can recommend there's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film there's not one memorable acting performance are you a sarah michelle <UNK> fan enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue are you an <UNK> <UNK> fan i hope you can deal with the fact that she's given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she's suffering from a <UNK> nerve can you believe the story if you can call it that is even worse than the br br at least the original was fairly creepy and <UNK> a few effective jump scenes i didn't jump once during this yeah i made the word up deal with it that's right not a single time the scares are so <UNK> and they are so blatantly <UNK> that there is absolutely no shock value once the <UNK> moment arrives watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess you're always four or five scenes ahead br br there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a <UNK> of milk and then begins to <UNK> it back into the <UNK> huh i say huh the audience laughed i <UNK> my head and <UNK> there was a lot of that during the movie laughing <UNK> head shaking falling asleep i did twice br br the movie even makes a 1 <UNK> hearted attempt at a plot twist wow it's so bad that i don't think we should even <UNK> it by <UNK> it a twist did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the <UNK> please it was as shocking as <UNK> john coming out of the closet br br and of course the ending goes the whole non closure look we might have another sequel route as soon as the credits rolled the audience <UNK> my sentiments exactly had the audience paid money for this turd <UNK> then things would have most likely gotten violent and i would've gladly led the charge br br we learned from the grudge that there's a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage then a curse is left behind much like a ben affleck movie it's a <UNK> that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred well in the grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a <UNK> on any theater where the movie shows br br the <UNK> br br if you're a total <UNK> and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares but i strongly recommend saving your money otherwise there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge

<START> the <UNK> adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980's alvin and the <UNK> have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll neither one of the <UNK> has any bad traits <UNK> really the star and has all the cool looks theodore is the lovable sensitive one then there's simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often a party i also like the a lot there's <UNK> who like alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular then there's <UNK> who like theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food <UNK> is the only who is not much like her counterpart she's very naive and really clumsy br br in the very first full length movie david <UNK> is going on a business trip to europe and he's leaving the boys with miss miller while he's gone while playing an <UNK> game alvin loses against <UNK> and then says that if he had the money he'd race <UNK> around the world for real <UNK> to the kids a man named <UNK> and his sister <UNK> who have been trying to come up with a <UNK> way to deliver <UNK> around the world in exchange for cash <UNK> this conversation and said that they'd let them race around the world for 100 000 alvin and <UNK> accept it and go on the race br br this adventurous movie has a lot of great songs off to see the world made for an appropriate theme song for the movie then there is getting lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie my mother is most likely the song in the movie but it always makes me cry <UNK> bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original then of course there's the boys and girls of rock and roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history br br i used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died i still watch the movie though this is actually a fun movie for people who are about to go on a vacation to a foreign country for the first time it'll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you'd expect out of world travel definitely one of my childhood movies and one that i'd recommend to 80's fans and alvin the <UNK> fans

<START> this show has shown it's true colors now that <UNK> are in power it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been <UNK> to think one way which is a scary thing br br comedy central moved this it's spin off back to an earlier time once the <UNK> took power for a reason because now when the <UNK> screw up which is just as often as <UNK> do stewart no longer takes pot shots at them that is why the ratings for both this the spin are dropping br br basically most of the humor now is either lame or lame sarah <UNK> jokes which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling the facts to back this up speak for themselves the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled the ratings for <UNK> conan the shows that follow them are down br br so emperor stewart is not alone trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the <UNK> <UNK> in power they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show <UNK> <UNK> leno were higher there br br has done one thing proved these shows have to be willing to take chances rip the folks in power if they are to <UNK> right now the daily show stewart are <UNK> but maybe they can get lucky have <UNK> elected as the first woman president in <UNK> then the lame <UNK> jokes will become ratings <UNK>
<START> left quite a noticeable impression in my head the story is quick paced and leaves you constantly absorbed and at many times quite tense its about five remarkable student doctors notably julia roberts and kevin bacon among whom one of them has <UNK> the <UNK> of remaining dead or getting flat <UNK> for a few seconds and then coming back to life br br the <UNK> is quite involving a <UNK> of medical <UNK> <UNK> electric <UNK> <UNK> masks and a variety of <UNK> medical terms i strongly suspect doctors <UNK> all these words so that they never need to get <UNK> off but <UNK> they follow the kiss original version for <UNK> keep it simple stupid extended version for doctors keep it stupid simple philosophy as well at the risk of getting <UNK> by some revenge taking doctor reader let me continue br br so the first guy who gets flat <UNK> hopes to find the answers to life which philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer he hopes to get it answered and become famous through applied science he flat lines for around two minutes and then comes back into our world left quite <UNK> during death he has a vision of an incident when he was young which left the strongest impression on his life he killed another boy when he was kid by accident and he still feels responsible for it br br with the success of the first flat liner the others follow suit each of them <UNK> their flat line time further and further to test the limits of how long one can remain dead and experience life after death br br meanwhile monsters from the past and future keep coming back to haunt them after their flat line experience the first flat liner is haunted by a young kid who <UNK> him when he is alone the second who camera ed all the women he took to bed sees television sets all over playing his videos the third is haunted by a young girl who he <UNK> in school the fourth is haunted by her suicide dead father for whom she feels responsible br br all of them are driven insane by these haunting and <UNK> and think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them the main focus on getting flat <UNK> is that your entire life passes through your eyes at the moment of whatever stage that is and you are left mostly with the strongest impressions of life in your mind since they didn't die these strong impressions have somehow <UNK> and have become the focus of their lives br br all of them somehow come to terms with and their past demons all of them except the first one who realizes the only way he can move on through life is getting flat <UNK> again during this flat line session he sees himself getting flat <UNK> the first time and also sees the boy he killed trying to kill him this time round the boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so has sought revenge for a few minutes in the movie one is left wondering if he gets to come back thankfully because most of us like happy endings the boy him of his past and he comes back to life again
<START> take an utterly stupid story couple it with <UNK> performances 2 bit graphics add ultra lame comedy bits and you get this film i thought the original was bad but at least that story was simple and straightforward though idiotic may nobody produce another in this series
<START> this was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention through to the very end maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject matter and that's why it's being <UNK> so much it could also be too deep for many of the viewers out there who give movies like the american pie series higher ratings br br jake <UNK> is a cia <UNK> not an agent who is to observe an <UNK> of an egyptian man by not <UNK> he's not supposed to be a hardened agent and so comes off as naive of the <UNK> techniques used this is more believable than if he were to come across as being an old hat at it br br the story jumps around a bit and can be confusing but it also makes you stay focused on whats going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place the supporting actors did a good job of helping to carry the movie i found the movie to be powerful and thought provoking
<START> absolutely <UNK> director arthur <UNK> and writer <UNK> <UNK> the american hospital system with this wicked comedy drama <UNK> the hospital depicted here is <UNK> with problems from <UNK> neighbors to <UNK> patients to a potential serial killer on the loose george c scott is the top doctor who on the brink of his own nervous breakdown gets involved with free spirited diana <UNK> and her wacky father <UNK> hughes alternately depressing and <UNK> the hospital features some of the most acid <UNK> dialog imaginable note how scott describes his love making session with <UNK> it also has a lot of great vignettes scott <UNK> head nurse nancy <UNK> after one of here <UNK> accidentally kills a doctor <UNK> <UNK> frances trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people scott getting <UNK> advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his <UNK> home life all of the acting is first rate scott and <UNK> are dynamite and hughes is a real surprise the movie is a masterpiece with script <UNK> a well deserved oscar over such stiff competition as <UNK> sunday bloody sunday the opening narration is priceless
<START> after reading about this documentary i rented it and watched it with my teenage children it was amazingly well balanced showing each <UNK> perspective and leaving many questions unanswered this is as it should be i don't watch a documentary to be told what to think i watch it to learn and to draw my own conclusions br br afterward we took a trip to <UNK> and visited the branch <UNK> at the site of the <UNK> this was a potent lesson in seeing for yourself and it drove home the basic underlying honesty behind <UNK> the rules of engagement if you just open your eyes and look the facts can speak for themselves
<START> i've waited 9 years to watch this film simply because i never saw it advertised on tv eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait it's much better than your over hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace with no drawn out <UNK> through the house to cheesy music scenes only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way what lies beneath over hyped and crap mute witness low budget not hyped at all and very good
<START> i first saw this movie in a <UNK> film festival 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether i needed help i was still sitting crying like a maniac the movie is cheesy it's bizarre it's over the top it's gay but it is amazing i do think that every character is plausible character is mean to a woman who only tries to help he brutally throws his terrible friends out he does have a temper he can harm a fly the fly that killed the love of his life <UNK> so bates is a miracle she is perfect just like a role a woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love i even understand max the husband he is bored with his life he's got a <UNK> crisis he moves out tries to lead an exciting life only to realise a that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b that he loves his wife i love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because i think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality for in the end he's her husband and he might not be as exciting as victor but he's real he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way i've watched it about 50 times and i do love this film everything about it <UNK> btw just read rupert autobiography and <UNK> is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made to me it's the best film he ever made
<START> i'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest <UNK> of the year following one of the biggest <UNK> in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation the sequel falls into many of the same traps the plot line was completely forced the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute and the action was contrived and far from the heart <UNK> brilliance of each monsters original films the best part of <UNK> is in fact the trailer which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about i gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude the movie played out like a color by number sci fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened because you'd seen it a thousand times before the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us but what drew people in when they released the <UNK> game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the alien trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from because to be honest seeing a waitress killed by the alien we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us lets take the series back to its roots learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a new <UNK> we liked the originals for a reason we want to see that again lastly the ending is the real wtf moment of the whole film spoiler after the big climax the survivors are <UNK> by special <UNK> soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying <UNK> were following and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into <UNK> then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking <UNK> into the heavens we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger i've ever seen with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie save the government dude then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci fi channel original movie <UNK> and turn up its nose so in <UNK> if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the earth skip the movie and do the other thing instead
<START> or is this another way below the bottom of the barrel masterpiece preferably both somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again nothing more needs to be explained asked or screamed out loud if you followed closely at my <UNK> about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk then you know what's in store with scream baby scream the title sounds cool it's just the weak script that should have gone <UNK> else even so this is hands down the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic <UNK> ever worked on film br br if you thought this is an early slasher which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment better luck next time the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie which supposedly tells of a blue faced psychopath out to kill and make some ugly facial <UNK> on his victims it feels like you're watching another early scooby doo episode my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in and <UNK> for an actress under the name for giving us the worst facial <UNK> ever 1969 has never been this bad but it is br br try finding this 30 year old <UNK> at a bargain basement for five bucks it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power bad fashions and trashy music interesting note scream baby scream is also listed in <UNK> film <UNK> on the <UNK> website only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s <UNK> gosh knows they need to plan 9 is history
<START> valentine a model in france is separated from her lover who is abroad they plan to meet up in england but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses one night after <UNK> a pass made by her <UNK> she hits a dog named rita the dog survives and she returns it to her owner a hostile retired judge who's is living as a <UNK> and listening in on the conversations of all his <UNK> she becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often often becoming part of his <UNK> games one conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife which we find out parallels the life of the man who is <UNK> upon them as we find out more about the couple the man reveals more of his story then continues his story and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate little does valentine know how her life this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become <UNK> together her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner allowing valentine to be the <UNK> of the young judge who is traveling the same path as her dear friend to prevent him from having such a grim future filled with loneliness and <UNK> it seems the old man's dream will come true after all and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days br br an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time <UNK> never <UNK> to <UNK> me he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome usually <UNK> with a subtle pause or late focus in a scene see if you can spot some i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything a work of art 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> shown on cable recently is a small movie that packs a lot harris done directs with style the screen play by mr done and diane fine makes a good thriller br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading br br the film is the story about a young l a doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten bad choice what thomas reed finds in <UNK> <UNK> is hell in the desert right after landing a job as a bar tender thomas meets a pretty young woman sunny who clearly is someone to stay away from the young doctor is called to help as <UNK> boyfriend randy is <UNK> down by a drug dealer br br we get to know <UNK> family his uncle dean appears to be ok but his brother owen is a loose cannon every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the <UNK> sunny br br the performances are fine vincent <UNK> is thomas the man who should have gone to his l a practice instead of making a <UNK> to the small town alexandra <UNK> is sunny a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings kevin <UNK> <UNK> henry brian austin play the men in the family well nicholas <UNK> makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer br br the film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film

<START> i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring
<START> the movie shows many feelings and emotions that are very strong and personal the atmosphere in the movie is very tense and sad you can really get a clear picture of what the main character is going through and how he is <UNK> to the world around him i think it is a great movie and that everybody should see it br br
<START> the promise of martin <UNK> playing jesus was quite honestly enough to get me to see the film definitely worthwhile clever and funny without <UNK> it the low quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring and the ending sounded more like a <UNK> program than hartley still too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it <UNK>
<START> this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era <UNK> and <UNK> meet up with the monsters later in <UNK> and <UNK> meet it was a somewhat <UNK> yet fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the wolf man <UNK> monster and dracula one last time br br i say <UNK> because in the previous film house of frankenstein both dracula and the wolf man are killed according to how the vampire and werewolf legends say they should be dracula by the <UNK> and the wolf man by a silver bullet yet somehow they return in house of dracula with no explanation this movie could have played as a kind of prequel to house of frankenstein if the frankenstein monster plot wouldn't be continuing <UNK> into house of dracula from house of frankenstein and if the wolf man didn't get <UNK> then <UNK> be no plot holes but since this is not the case the plots of dracula and the wolf man make no sense br br however ignoring these plot holes house of dracula is a classic atmospheric horror film that's fun to watch it has many high points especially seeing the wolf man get <UNK> i know i just said that this shouldn't have been included but it was nice to actually see him get <UNK> after all this time and the scene with the lady playing <UNK> on the piano then all of a sudden playing a haunting melody when under <UNK> spell was very eerie dr transformation into the dr mr hyde type character was also done very well br br and it's great to see dracula frankenstein and the wolf man together one last time br br out of
<START> what a <UNK> br br it must have been made for tv or cable br br look forget the screenplay forget the bunch of forgettable actors excuse me continuity the <UNK> whatever or whoever he is an agent takes off in an <UNK> is shown in an <UNK> his guts up and later the aircraft shown is an phantom <UNK> wish that i could be so <UNK> br br apart from the male actors the women are <UNK> blue eyed and long <UNK> and eventually get to cry about the heroes who save them even when a solid <UNK> could save most of the <UNK> <UNK> the blond drops the <UNK> tool duh br br as an sf movie one out of ten as a movie per se 1 2 that's a half point they should have <UNK> the space station and headed for mars br br major <UNK>
<START> sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror if you can just toe tap your way through the slow paced early scenes sometimes a real gem will present itself this unfortunately was not the case with <UNK> whip br br written and directed by jason <UNK> whip attempts to drag us along on a boring <UNK> fest of a film with no real pay off at the end i'm guessing that the black white and blue cinematography must have been for a reason however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on the story in itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic this combined with the slow pacing and lack of any real red gore made <UNK> whip one to forget quite quickly i will give it a 4 rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time
<START> even if i had not read anne <UNK> queen of the damned from the vampire chronicles i probably would still have thought this movie was just awful br br it was tasteless plot less it made absolutely no sense at all i sat for a while <UNK> the plot from the book and the longer i thought of it the worse it was to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie let alone the book the bare few ideas taken from <UNK> genius in the vampire chronicles were butchered and <UNK> br br it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being last film truly it's an insult to <UNK> fans as well br br possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics good as they may be it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie as a matter of fact i signed up for this <UNK> for the sole reason of <UNK> to people bothering to look at this film 7 years after the release as it may be to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment
<START> i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish but i honestly can't seem to come up with much i can't even come up with many of those so bad it's good kind of moments devil fish is just plain old bad the plot is completely derivative jaws anyone the acting is wooden the characters are uninteresting the special effects are beyond bad and the score is annoying add to that the seemingly inept direction of <UNK> <UNK> and you've got one stinker of a movie i think however that the film's biggest sin is its lack of a budget it doesn't appear that <UNK> had much to work with by 1984 the italian film industry was in full decline  especially as far as genre films go the funding available to <UNK> was most probably very <UNK> film's like devil fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good it's not the only italian film to suffer this fate there are a number of italian movies made in the mid 80s whose ideas and concepts far <UNK> what anyone could realistically have expected given their <UNK> limitations br br however having said all that and noting the film's many weaknesses i can't bring myself to rate devil fish lower than a 3 10 i've even considered rating it higher but can't because i realize how bad a movie it is why don't i rate it lower well that's hard to explain despite the many problems found in the movie there's something about devil fish that i inexplicably enjoy it could be as simple as my love for low budget cheesy italian movies maybe my taste in movies is horribly <UNK> but i enjoy what i enjoy br br the mystery science theater 3000 treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable i rate devil fish a 4 5 on my mst3k rating scale the guys do a fine job of <UNK> fun at the movie's many flaws one very <UNK> observation comes very early in the commentary when tom <UNK> notes just because you can edit doesn't mean you should  <UNK> yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in devil fish
<START> look this film is terrible the plot involves twins who are neglected by their self absorbed parents and left in the care of a succession of and <UNK> all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious eventually the kids engineer ex convict beverly <UNK> to be their new <UNK> do you care why and <UNK> watches a tv talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins and well oh you don't want to know it's all very unpleasant and not at all funny in fact the <UNK> <UNK> this film before it came on the tv channel i was watching just don't bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash
<START> it is clear this film's value far <UNK> the cost with which the format mini <UNK> implies in fact the filmmaker <UNK> the format and <UNK> it so <UNK> into the storyline that i forgot the fact that i was not seeing the typical 35 <UNK> film it has the core appeal of indie movies like <UNK> the work of robert rodriguez combined with a fantastic new take on the romantic comedy genre this is not a film is an honest film with honest portrayals and it is a superbly paced narrative there is not one point in this film where i felt a scene could have or should have been <UNK> on the contrary the director pulls amazing performances out of truly gifted actors and does so in extremely <UNK> circumstances from page to screen this film is a worthy and relevant story that hits on so many levels creative technical or otherwise i highly recommend it for all who enjoy cinema or those looking for a little charm in an otherwise devoid of charm medium
<START> i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out they showed clips every week on <UNK> tv and everyone was excited it <UNK> opening weekend at number two behind indiana jones and the last <UNK> then it did a <UNK> critics hated this film i don't remember seeing one good review everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque i didn't know they meant back then but now i do since the movie makes references to gay bars women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar <UNK> with <UNK> lol when i was younger i didnt care for that it was brother br br now i find this pretty bad but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with which has a better storyline first off hulk <UNK> acting skills just aren't great he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring and actually rip and hulk are not to far off from each other kurt fuller is a good actor but he is not good at playing the bad guy he is better at comedy and nervous drama characters he is just not believable as there isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of randy brother and charlie the <UNK> in wrestling its <UNK> of a <UNK> a wrestler to the ring lol tiny <UNK> plays <UNK> the way its supposed to be played so there <UNK> any problem there joan is passable and for all you <UNK> <UNK> she does have a <UNK> scene lol by the end you figure what's the point br br for this one as with other wrestling films or films that feature <UNK> as the main star turn your brain off you'll enjoy it more if you do
<START> i love this movie one of my all time favorites ann <UNK> as sally is sweet and trouble free she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles the sub plot of the <UNK> bad man to get her father's property is funny and clever her brothers are what kind of brothers any girl would love to have also look for aunt <UNK> as her mother a strong irish woman who won't leave her house that she brought her family up in they don't make them like this anymore that's for sure
<START> i enjoyed this film immensely i'm really into films where females kick lots of butt so this film already had my hopes up for some decent entertainment my hopes were met and <UNK> less than 20 minutes into the film the action humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time it had sam jackson and his <UNK> screen presence <UNK> davis as i've never seen her before demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you don't want to give it br br <UNK> plays samantha caine an <UNK> desperate to remember something about her past but quickly realizing the more she finds out the more she wants to forget and eventually becomes consumed until finally samantha is so more and <UNK> is all that's left but now can <UNK> and sam two completely different women possibly exist in the same body we have characters that pop in and out of the film that <UNK> each side of sam <UNK> like sam jackson and craig <UNK> craig is also irresistible as timothy the sexy bad guy with no conscience br br this film was perfectly casted and perfectly acted over the top and wonderfully entertaining you watch the impossible happen and applaud when it does so worth your time watch it you won't be sorry
<START> warning contains spoilers br br this is one of the best italian sleaze films i've seen br br the plot has a teenage girl who is interested of <UNK> and has supernatural powers her mother is a member of <UNK> group and is afraid what influences it'll have on the girl no need to worry the girl knows just what to do and there's no return she belongs to satan br br during the film odd things happen in typical <UNK> way there's not too much logic but that's only good thing it's amazing how entertaining these films are on the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other nude off course and doing some mysterious <UNK> you might guess who wins the films final pictures leaves your mouth open and wandering why can't there be more films like this br br there's superb music through the whole film and the actors are quite good better than usual in these type of films specially anne <UNK> looks and acts good it also has some unusual camera angles and stuff like that so it's not boring at all my rating is 10 br br hopefully someone releases this on dvd
<START> the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant <UNK> and i thought it would be interesting to see brad and <UNK> phillips team up together again since bully unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie <UNK> plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time phillips but <UNK> likes one of the boys from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them and of course like all other movies things are good or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids br br the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and <UNK> it is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it you feel you could have done anything better some scenes the ones with parents don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it at all br br all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode <UNK> barton and rachel <UNK> from the <UNK> br br the only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a one rating from me is phillips they needed more scenes with her in it just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully and for <UNK> sake the title is <UNK> change the name
<START> two great stars and a legendary director created a magnificent <UNK> love story that is memorable and moving on so many levels br br henry king directed jennifer jones in her first hit song of <UNK> and he again directs jennifer jones in this film and miss jones is perfect in this role and gives a edgy beautiful performance that captures the conflict in the character and bill <UNK> who hit home run after home run in the with a series of smash hit films beginning with sunset <UNK> <UNK> 17 born yesterday country girl <UNK> and of course river <UNK> is superb in this role hard to imagine anyone but <UNK> in this movie i loved the ending and cry every time i see it for anyone who has ever loved and lost you will understand for those who haven't you won't
<START> i've loved this movie since i was a little kid i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me i loved it and i still do i think it's very funny and original there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie lou is also a surprisingly good singer the actors that portray prince arthur and princess <UNK> are okay too but <UNK> and <UNK> are the best former <UNK> boxing sensation buddy <UNK> also brother of former <UNK> champion max <UNK> is good in this movie as the cop and the giant he's a better actor than boxer he had a natural talent the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou <UNK> keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy <UNK> the slapstick in the house is good too i especially like the comedy in the castle my favorite parts are the part were lou is climbing the and they're all singing as a farewell jack is singing back to them that he'll return lou <UNK> is a very good at singing my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an <UNK> they keep exploding <UNK> and <UNK> are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time this is only one of their great movies that i will love and <UNK> the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why this is a very good <UNK> and <UNK> movie i also love how lou <UNK> comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around very good movie
<START> i was lucky enough to see this at this years <UNK> film festival i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was director <UNK> dunne has done a great job <UNK> this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and <UNK> the main story involves the family and it is very thought provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene the film as a whole has credibility and integrity yet still has that commercial edge an indie movie for the masses if you like the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the <UNK> diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated early days i know but lane acts her <UNK> off here
<START> don't let the rating of 5 9 as of this writing on 12 8 <UNK> fool you this is one excellent film br br i cannot <UNK> how this got such a rating considering being so solid at all levels the direction acting cinematography all good the story is interesting and original and my only <UNK> as far as understanding why the rating is such sits in the fact that it is probably the type of movie that people rating might not normally see br br i <UNK> it to playing modern rock for an 80 year old you might be young brought up on it and love it but he or she has not been and as a product of a different time and taste doesn't care for it br br if you like films and can handle movies based more on real people versus those comprised of mindless action enormous flashy budgets and mediocre talent give this one a try next time you see it on br br
<START> this film is a powerful commentary on family life in north america today the story is so well constructed it almost feels like its happening across the street right now if you are connected with your family and community in any way this film will grab you and transport you to the home and not allow you to leave until the credits are done br br our imaginary heroes through a <UNK> of innocent circumstances often <UNK> lead us down a path of sorrow confusion and isolation the travis family after a terrible tragedy invite each of us father mother brother and sister into their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just doesn't quit we see all of the above and eventually the joy in powerful performances by the major players and the rest of the cast making this film a movie goers absolute treasure br br in a film so well done as this it is usually difficult to to find something special but <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of sandy travis was outstanding i would be surprised if others didn't recognize it as such br br clearly a 10 well done
<START> i watched death machines as part of <UNK> <UNK> drive in cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets i am growing to love many of crown movies especially the creepy erotic psychological thrillers br br death machines is not one of them br br after seeing movies like <UNK> beach the <UNK> terror and the pink angels it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made but it doesn't have much going for it br br no plot really no story to speak of br br the acting isn't evident  only the actor responsible for the terribly played tony with the thick fake italian accent made any attempt to get into character br br the score is annoying and <UNK> br br the only thing about this movie is why what compelled the film makers to make this film br br did they think the story of 1 three ninjas 2 two competing crime bosses 3 an <UNK> bartender karate school student character and 4 his pitiful love interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made br br this is a complete waste of time and money for you me the producers writers actors and the director
<START> michael jackson is amazing this short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and no one will ever be able to out beat this <UNK> of <UNK> masterpiece it shows michael turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography the story is great the scenes are marvelous the music is fantastic and overall the clip is fun eye popping spooky and is a real spectacle today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with dancing and film based story lines which he <UNK> this ground breaking video is the <UNK> of mtv and will forever be remembered for what is the greatest music video of all time
<START> i rented this obscure aussie <UNK> a few years ago to show at a friend s place and it was an instant success the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly <UNK> 70 s australian twist the acting <UNK> t exactly shakespeare society stuff here but later mad max star bruce <UNK> is a beautifully understated scarecrow and there are some <UNK> comic turns by gary and robin <UNK> as a deliciously 70 s camp fairy <UNK> father character also note the musical contribution from ex daddy cool <UNK> ross wilson on the title song in a similar vein to later day aussie comedies such as <UNK> queen of the desert good fun
<START> this movie was amazing never before have i seen such a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use quite like this one there is no <UNK> sugar <UNK> or <UNK> heroine this movie shows the true struggles pain and loss people go through when dealing with this drug good film decent emotionally packed acting and a great storyline a much watch br br
<START> this movie was to me a fairly enjoyable watch i mean it wasn't great but it was one of the better horror movies of late it seems to have been low almost state benefit budget size but it has it's charms like the lovely ladies in it the atmosphere was good also which is what is missing hell of a lot of horror movies these days the acting was your typical 80's low budget affair that being in case you don't know is that it is dud acting but that is what lucio <UNK> movies were full of they like this movie had atmosphere what they were lacking in storyline and money etc they more than made up for in the horror gore atmosphere for the movie it's self br br it is just a typical low budget horror movie that is watchable i watched it all the way and i love horror movies i've seen movies where i just turn off within 10 to 20 minutes or sit and fast forward it if it's on video or skip <UNK> on the dvd this movie didn't make me want to do that i sat and watched it all the way to the end without wanting to skip parts br br i would have liked it however if the zombie type folk in this were a little more scarier as they were about as scary as having freddy <UNK> as your babysitter not but seriously though if they were a little better it would have been low budget perfection maybe br br the music in this movie was top notch stuff ideal horror music so it was i've seen horror movies where the music is good or average but it could have been better thank goodness though this movie didn't have <UNK> of the metal music in it br br i've been a die hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music <UNK> it the movie <UNK> atmosphere a lot when any type of music other than a score is playing so i'm glad there was no music in this movie other than just your typical score which was rather creepy well done br br it could have use <UNK> grace <UNK> of <UNK> dreams on it though as it is keyboard music no <UNK> no nothing except really creepy keyboard tracks like track one forever sleep you hear the wind blowing all the way through it and some <UNK> <UNK> inducing keyboard music that follows it ever track on that cd is the same ideal horror music at it's best it would have suited this movie perfectly br br the only unattractive chick in the movie to me was the one who got killed or so we are led to believe and hung up as a scarecrow only to get free and try to escape later every other woman in the movie was lovely indeed a big 9 out of 10 for them all except the one i mentioned above br br i wish that hollywood mainstream side of things would give money to romero and the guy who made this movie as giving it to them for movies is way better a decision made than giving it to a <UNK> muppet called paul anderson of the resident evil <UNK> br br well done guys it is not bad not bad at all i loved the part at the end credits when they kept showing you clips of them making the movie behind the <UNK> not many movies do this kind of thing which i thought added a little to the movie as it also showed you some <UNK> of sorts and that's always a good thing if you ask me br br rating for this movie 8 10 rating for the lovely ladies in the movie 9 10 rating for the atmosphere in the movie 9 10 rating for the score for the film 9 5 10
<START> it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film the story is predictable when not completely laughable it's all a matter of <UNK> gestures which as presented here carry absolutely no conviction yes the mgm production values are gorgeous and yes ms <UNK> was <UNK> beautiful but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no chemistry together and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released the passage of time has not improved it
<START> to <UNK> my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites <UNK> plot inconsistencies <UNK> loose ends and other ridiculous aspects of this movie i found the story trite to the point of <UNK> and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the <UNK> <UNK> still locked in the <UNK> cream <UNK> from jurassic park 1 the editing was poor and none of the characters <UNK> any sort of sympathy or feeling in short this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpoint br br even the new dinosaurs were few and far between although i really enjoyed the <UNK> we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action br br as a scientist and former childhood <UNK> the lack of any real scientific content not that it had to be realistic but <UNK> formed i e how they built the <UNK> in 1 and chaos <UNK> was disappointing as well br br in short the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to <UNK> <UNK> back on the scene to make some money i hope that movie goers don't fall for this trap again although i did apparently
<START> <UNK> the big risk is a french gangster movie that doesn't try for style that's why it has style because the movie is so <UNK> and so matter of fact it becomes more and more involving and because <UNK> is played by <UNK> <UNK> we wind up emotionally invested in this <UNK> tough killer who loves his wife and kids has an encounter with customs agents on the shore near nice at night that neither he nor we expect and who proves just as willing to shoot a cop or a <UNK> with as little emotion as <UNK> off a bit of <UNK> we first meet in italy with his wife and their two small boys one about 9 and one 4 br br this man was <UNK> sentenced to death in we're told on the run for years he had watched his resources <UNK> even as his anxiety kept him on the move with the italian police closing in each day france was again his best bet maybe he'd been forgotten br br was a top gangster in paris who took care of his friends that was several years ago a heist to give him money to return to france goes very wrong now he's hiding out with his two kids he calls his friends in paris to help him out he and his kids need to get from nice to paris but the police are hunting him and they've set up for two best friends time has passed and they've moved on they don't want to put themselves at risk and for what <UNK> gives may to caution so they hire a young thief eric stark jean paul <UNK> to pick up and the children in an <UNK> then to drive to paris with heavily <UNK> and the children hidden we're on a journey where <UNK> are increasingly limited where he must find ways to have his children cared for where he realizes there are no more ties of friendship where betrayal seems likely and where quite possibly his only friend left is eric stark br br this somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without about there are no <UNK> <UNK> with pulled up <UNK> no <UNK> with the melodrama of the gangster code so many french directors have loved <UNK> gives us <UNK> a man who once was somebody who now is <UNK> down to be nobody and who <UNK> with violence and <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the movie yet when he is paired with jean paul <UNK> a curious chemistry happens <UNK> as is grim and worried about caring for his sons he is <UNK> by his situation he is a tough man who sees killing someone if needed as just part of the business he's in <UNK> as the young thief who initially is sent to be an <UNK> driver and winds up being a friend to count on provides the <UNK> that keeps the movie from being just one more ride down the elevator <UNK> was 27 and looks younger his unlikely star power as a lead actor broken nose under jaw shines right off the screen he makes <UNK> a match for <UNK> when they share a scene and <UNK> scenes with sandra milo the young woman who becomes his girl friend <UNK> charm and good natured sex appeal the ending is bittersweet fate and without a <UNK> <UNK> in sight we hear say gone there's nothing left it would be well worth watching <UNK> to learn what he means br br there are many fine french gangster films i'd place this one right there with <UNK> <UNK> and bob le to see one of <UNK> <UNK> finest performances watch army of shadows
<START> spoilers in this review despite a few highly improbable scenes including the boys in <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> in a contest and the few obligatory teens trying to get laid vignettes this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done it achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends gary dave rick as smoking drinking ever on the <UNK> teens but also <UNK> on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their <UNK> tested this film is a <UNK> of the time when childhood ends for the shy romantic gary when he sees the lovely karen for the first time he falls instantly in love the awakening emotion in gary is <UNK> large on the screen and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is <UNK> by her lover this love for karen <UNK> the end of <UNK> innocence as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested and broken over the course of the story the confident ladies man rick is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were handsome cool and always has the <UNK> beautiful girls in a <UNK> rick turns out to be a <UNK> but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old he <UNK> and makes a bad decision from <UNK> perspective the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams a bad <UNK> and then at the end <UNK> the look on <UNK> face as gary walks in and sees karen kissing rick shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman as in real life you don't bow out because your friend has an <UNK> love this is the tragedy of the film rick is no villain and constantly through the film he reminds gary and dave that they're his best friends the <UNK> quality of <UNK> performance however is the heart of the story lawrence is a beautiful loser he does everything right his <UNK> in the right place and he's consumed by love for karen yet karen in the end is not moved by <UNK> devotion and kindness karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back who exist in a <UNK> of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they <UNK> on others this film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship but that's what makes it unique among teen films it <UNK> being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her will understand the <UNK> <UNK> of high school are every bit as real as the emotional <UNK> of <UNK> and this film will remind you of that in bold <UNK> <UNK> final <UNK> as he drives away with the <UNK> is as poignant a moment as any in cinema one feels after watching this that it's really made of two movies the first part is a silly teen <UNK> film and once the story begins it's a strongly affecting drama a terrific movie it should also be noted that the soundtrack was <UNK> in its selection of many rising stars including the police the cars <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and phil seymour
<START> poor action films are the <UNK> for aging martial art stars in such films they struggle to maintain that dangerous demeanor that made their early work successful but they all end in failure seagal is too old for this type of role but he wont let go no matter how silly he looks some hope his current work will somehow bring back the magic but there is no magic left the late '80s and early <UNK> <UNK> to steven seagal and his work made me a fan i could see him fit nicely in a <UNK> on the sopranos where his overweight body features and <UNK> attitude could have found a home i wonder what the return is on his run of direct to video films since he produces them i'm assuming the is more than satisfactory if this is the deal we will be subjected to poorly done seagal action films well into his late 60s and 70s
<START> so real and surreal all in one i remember feeling like <UNK> heck i remember being <UNK> this was a beautiful <UNK> of a relationship ending i especially liked the <UNK> <UNK> it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being <UNK> over the head with it if you get the chance to see this take it it is well worth the 30 minutes
<START> i am coming out fighting here because this film was so well shot and so well cast that i am twice as angry about its de evolution than i would have been with a lesser work without revealing too much of the plot i can only say that part one of my 2 vhs set was an unnerving unfolding delight of bizarre but plausible plot developments the lead character was suitably <UNK> like but also intelligent and very very open the events that he is rapidly forced to come to terms with are the <UNK> of his parents the culture shock when his <UNK> roots <UNK> with a complete breakdown of english society in the sixties his father's dubious transformation into the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and the turning of his cousin into a feminist <UNK> as his best friend suddenly becomes an icon of the <UNK> punk movement in the seventies among other things br br what made me so angry was the amount of detailed work each actor put into creating and establishing their characters in the first part only to have the whole thing <UNK> into very bad porn episodes in the second part far too many to justify plot development and far too explicit to even seem erotic my biggest pet <UNK> is when directors let their private <UNK> <UNK> with the truth of their movie and this to me was a supreme example br br i felt a bit like i'd been invited to a party of very clever funny strangers only to have the doors locked and the guests not allowed to interact and all of us forced to watch bad seventies <UNK> films instead what an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors why not just make a <UNK> flick to begin with and why cast a great lead character who can actually act and then cut away from him whenever he is building up to a great performance i almost felt as if he too was growing tired of the endless sex scenes where all he did was lie there <UNK> his for yet another <UNK> naked actress br br bottom line part one is minor genius part two is second <UNK> soap opera <UNK> i know the book is quite explicit but i felt that these fine actors were as exploited in real life as their characters were in the movie and it made me quite angry and very uncomfortable only john waters can pull off such a dubious <UNK> of actors and plot and have it seem artistic my suggestion is to only watch the first part toss the second in the proverbial rubbish heap and you will love the <UNK> forever score a f 0
<START> this was pretty inevitable this movie borrows from the core and from the film it borrowed from <UNK> and the films it borrowed from and so on except this time there's luke perry too this films version of the familiar save the world plot involves super <UNK> beginning in the pacific <UNK> and <UNK> too the whole ring of fire its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed so the military and some scientists build one of those high tech <UNK> machines to go inside the earth and fix things it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet there's even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space like the one in <UNK> it's a sci fi network movie so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie there is in fighting between scientists and military guys there are rock melting <UNK> people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all and above all there are weak cgi special effects not original and not all that entertaining this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do particularly if you've got beer
<START> it looks b grade and you will probably think there is no reason to rent this film but do i expected nothing from this movie just something to pass the time but i was hooked from the start two interesting premises a bank robbery gone wrong a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life how will these two stories <UNK> just when you think you know what direction the movie is headed it does a <UNK> and you are left blown away by the great twists in the plot it has a great but unexpected ending and you are left wanting more always a good sign rent it or even buy it you will not be disappointed
<START> <UNK> machine is clearly a burt reynolds vehicle designed to allow the star room to <UNK> his talents and he <UNK> paints the machine the film plot with colors from other films and other styles offering a variety of <UNK> within a <UNK> story br br made in 1981 at minutes lengthy for the time period the film did well with box office at <UNK> <UNK> 000 it had a lot going for it burt reynolds actor and director a solid one two punch a william novel adaptation and the south land of <UNK> georgia at this time a land of opportunity for film production out of hollywood br br <UNK> tom <UNK> falling in love with rachel <UNK> the hooker with a heart of gold is here <UNK> as it was in <UNK> when he played opposite catherine <UNK> and that film also had a corrupt politician at its core but with downbeat ending not the hollywood happiness in <UNK> machine br br the story is pure detective <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> detective up a bust of a drug dealer causing the killing of some innocent <UNK> and gets literally transferred <UNK> to vice to deal with <UNK> and other m that cops consider <UNK> duty his new <UNK> offers him the chance to meet many equally <UNK> officers who are doing the dirty jobs no one else wants when some attention is pointed toward a certain <UNK> <UNK> looks over some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute rachel ward is being <UNK> by police forces and political forces and <UNK> sets himself up a 24 hour <UNK> force to watch her during the time he watches he learns that the current <UNK> <UNK> earl <UNK> is visiting as is a slick italian gangster victor <UNK> <UNK> before the police can build a case with the evidence billy <UNK> brother a coke <UNK> <UNK> henry <UNK> shoots through the door of apartment seemingly killing the beautiful but when <UNK> discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate <UNK> wells <UNK> confronts victor and tells him that he is going to have him arrested <UNK> is captured by some ninja killers lead by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and is tortured for information to lead to but <UNK> <UNK> them and <UNK> the <UNK> and in a <UNK> chase kills billy after he has killed victor br br reynolds wants to exhibit the inner <UNK> of a hardened policemen falling in love but the police story plot <UNK> with noir element and reynolds ability at cinematic development tends to slick over the dynamics of the relationships br br we come to learn something about some of the men and this leads us to reason why they are working towards their <UNK> in vice instead of fighting real crime this element of the film seems <UNK> under <UNK> off handed direction and performance br br there is always <UNK> to a reynolds film he likes to hire stars either character actors or others and then allow them to <UNK> sometimes with varying results br br with his crew in <UNK> machine he gets some fine moments and sometimes some overblown but always a sense of ensemble and good natured <UNK> with reynolds as auteur it works br br reynolds the actor auteur always seems to be <UNK> at himself and the viewer as if to say it's all fake but good fun br br great line in the scene with victor when <UNK> throws down the <UNK> you're <UNK> all over people like you own 'em and you wanna know the worst part you're from out of state this seems to be the greatest insult the officer can throw at a criminal br br reynolds made the film in <UNK> at his career point have shot himself reading the phone book and would have surely targeted and <UNK> br br the film did mark the appearance of rachel ward who was nominated as new star of the year in 1981 by the golden globe br br reynolds has always had presence and star power and has chosen to make films close to home georgia br br i got my dvd from half com for 7 99 and unfortunately it doesn't contain any commentary or making of features which is a shame maybe the next generation will have them br br the movie is still a lot of fun and both reynolds and ward are great looking actors in their prime
<START> i saw <UNK> 2 a few months ago and <UNK> t get to see the original <UNK> <UNK> a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel okay it s not a million miles away from the plot of seven but it s still compelling much of my praise has to do with ken s performance as red <UNK> a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret it d be easy for to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way likewise the murders are very shocking but unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out <UNK> in a rather <UNK> manner there s actually little violence shown br br my only criticisms are that the red <UNK> was too obviously a red <UNK> which meant i <UNK> t taken in by the shock twist and you would probably see the shock twist coming so i won t bother with a spoiler alert and that when the real murderer was revealed it seemed both slightly far fetched and caused a few plot holes to appear in the story if i remember correctly the sequel had similar problems once the murderer was revealed so maybe it d be a good idea not to make <UNK> 3
<START> i agree that this film wasted my time and my money the poster <UNK> me to thinking it was a different type of movie i should have known given the <UNK> look of the poster someone should sue for false advertising
<START> this was one of my favorite shows when i was a kid it had it all music stories a talking <UNK> and <UNK> daisies i wanted to be one of those hippie chicks singing and swinging on a swing i'm 35 and i grew up in south jersey but we got three new york channels with our cable hook up and i think it was on channel 11 they just don't make shows like this anymore i know that makes me sound really old and it blows my mind that i grew up with only 9 channels on our tv but i could always find something cool to watch i've only talked to one other person who actually heard of and watched this show she's three years younger than me and she grew up in north jersey i would love to see this series on dvd so i could show it to my 5 year old daughter and she could see what silly but great stuff her mom used to watch i just found a vhs tape of a few episodes and a music cd from the show on ebay and i bought them right up even though they were a little <UNK> i can't wait to get them to re live the great memories

<START> a man is <UNK> accused of killing his friend in an aircraft plant fire and must travel cross country to avoid the police and discover the true sinister nature of the situation at hand a plot line that was later used to fuel hitchcock's classic north by <UNK> <UNK> benefits from some very good performances as well as some masterful suspense sequences from the master himself br br for any hitchcock fan the plot is a bit too familiar but he was always able to <UNK> the story with its own memorable supporting characters and here the likable and charming robert <UNK> is the lead and soon finds himself visiting many strange and quirky characters not <UNK> a <UNK> of circus performers a rich businessman with hidden motives and a blind loner who shows him the best way to judge someone br br in terms of sheer originality and quality this does lack in some areas particularly the motive of the <UNK> however there is some nice chemistry between <UNK> and his lead lady the much under appreciated <UNK> lane as well as a truly moving performance as the blind man by vaughn <UNK> the best part is the final sequence which perfectly mirrors what hitchcock would use later in north by <UNK> only this time the climax is <UNK> a statue in new york certainly not his best but the master of suspense gives us some great moments to wait for
<START> i really enjoyed this movie yes there was <UNK> throughout the movie but bruce willis learned from the kid that there is more value in others and his life of <UNK> needs to change this movie was a refreshing change from the trash that hollywood is trying to <UNK> down our throats there are some very good lessons to be learned in this movie i really believe this was one of <UNK> best even though a couple of things could have been left out i was impressed with the lack of swearing and lack of sexual it isn't perfect but much better than most everything else out there
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is seldom a favorite of mine said that everyone should see this film as it is something that can help <UNK> the world br br it is one of the most poignant movies i have seen and delivers on comments i have read many comments and while they range from good to average to comments on the choice of actors the fact is that it deals with one of the most extra ordinary events in our world the truth and <UNK> <UNK> for the first time a country has <UNK> to air it's horrific history to find a way forward and to create a way for people to <UNK> br br while the movie starts out with the white policeman being offered a chance to <UNK> himself for brutal crimes and the black guy is trying to ensure that he does not get away with it it <UNK> into the humanity of the people and the enormous need for healing that we all need br br definitely a thumbs up to everyone involved once again i am proud to be a south african br br an interesting comment can be found here http www <UNK> community com article <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the thing is john carpenter's best movie <UNK> his talents for tension building and shocks with decent production values he turned out a perfectly crafted sci fi horror movie br br by filming in truly difficult conditions he creates a very believable isolated research base which sets the tension before anything has even happened the ensemble cast work well together with kurt russell proving a charismatic leading man even under all that beard br br by building the tension slowly with moments of gory horror courtesy of effects <UNK> rob <UNK> currently directing freddy vs jason carpenter creates a movie that has rarely been matched considering this came out the same year as et it could not be more different br br worth a watch <UNK> 9 out of 10 br br p s the dvd is excellent lots of extras plus the best dvd commentary going with carpenter russell plus <UNK> in <UNK> digital for even scarier sound effects
<START> some years back this film had been <UNK> for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  but what they actually showed was the <UNK> remake my brother had watched it and in <UNK> it followed the original pretty much scene for scene even down to the set design  though no classic he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly <UNK> earlier br br this being the first collaboration between <UNK> and bela lugosi i had high hopes for it  but these were <UNK> when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the film's main concern was to <UNK> the still novel sound technique and consequently the result is <UNK> and extremely static the thriller plot isn't exactly exciting either even less <UNK> is the <UNK> british indian setting with the characters' affected accents and upper class demeanor  not to mention the over use of corny <UNK> <UNK> such as i say rather and now look here  rendering the whole <UNK> more than anything else br br apart from this there are a few <UNK> <UNK> margaret as a fake medium <UNK> with police inspector lugosi if anything his <UNK> screen presence is already evident to give her some time to <UNK> who the <UNK> of the double murder really is the evidence points to her own daughter played by <UNK>  she hears a <UNK> and is <UNK> into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with <UNK> then lugosi enters the room and in his <UNK> accent straight tells her i knocked twice  you didn't hear me at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in <UNK> of laughter the editing is really sloppy too during one high angle shot of the main set a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range  and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks off screen ostensibly into the next shot to another part of the each shot is held on the other actors for an <UNK> long time so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few <UNK> br br the <UNK> chair marks the third non horror <UNK> <UNK> that i've watched  even if both this and <UNK> for sale 1939 deal with murder and <UNK> and could therefore still be linked to the genre much has been said about the director's apparent with the coming of sound however flawed though they may be the 4 straight horror films he did throughout the 30s are infinitely better than the rest  which i've always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that <UNK> wasn't as much at sea during this period as has been
<START> during the making of this movie i once caught a statement on television about it something like is now taking off <UNK> br br so my <UNK> of this movie was from the beginning to get a notion of <UNK> when recently seeing this movie in the tv version i had this <UNK> before me and it wasn't difficult to see this br br strangely enough i haven't met this way of <UNK> the film ever since i first heard it br br these are the things i found in four shades of brown in all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster br br 1 the worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them in the room in dealing with death and fire it's almost like a cheerful game to him the seriousness of death and fire is not <UNK> by the father and his boy <UNK> in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that <UNK> his father severely br br possible lesson the importance of showing the young adequate emotions when they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good br br 2 the magician <UNK> his wife like an invisible <UNK> just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand reaching for personality integrity and joy he pulls hard and she is back in <UNK> and despair br br their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste the real problem he is carrying within is far from <UNK> to him his fathers behavior passes on when <UNK> his own wife in his <UNK> environment br br possible lesson <UNK> <UNK> bondage br br 3 the father who was abused as a child passes on <UNK> to his children when he <UNK> them on their inheritance he <UNK> them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance br br possible lesson when no love given you cannot give any br br 4 the fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless with sadistic <UNK> here the ice cold nazi <UNK> becomes very obvious in physical violence it gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young head behavior when <UNK> others br br possible lesson can <UNK> take birth in a <UNK> home br br can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life in the long run be that room is given to sadistic <UNK> br br very seldom does a movie contains so much it reveals little by little as i <UNK> on it i consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb especially the nice seeming bloke played by that turns out to be the worst of all
<START> in the mid <UNK> <UNK> dennis hopper as daniel morgan <UNK> to australia seeking a share of the gold instead mr hopper finds himself <UNK> and thrown in a <UNK> prison there he is gang raped upon release hopper <UNK> up with <UNK> david <UNK> as billy with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic bill hunter as sergeant smith jack thompson as detective and others eventually vengeance becomes <UNK> hopper is admired and <UNK> by the common people and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities <UNK> <UNK> human performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film mr <UNK> heads up a strong supporting cast the <UNK> involved in mad dog morgan make it not only worth a look but also a huge disappointment br br mad dog morgan 1976 <UNK> <UNK> dennis hopper david <UNK> bill hunter
<START> this film was not about stereotypes nor dance moves nor pickup lines really this film was about the vulnerability of <UNK> hearts it was hard to believe that kevin james could play in a convincing role that will smith could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way i don't intend to sound overly <UNK> with this film it wasn't groundbreaking in any sort of way but it was a film worth seeing was it believable no new york couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the of <UNK> sure there are bar <UNK> but not ones that can get any chick at any time <UNK> those <UNK> in seven figures of course the thing that worked best for this film was its true focus on the dramatic side of things not just on the comedy it was a funny two hours no doubt but it was also two hours that made you sit in your seat become immersed in the characters and smile
<START> i had high expectations going into this film but alas i feel let down i bought it for 5 bucks at a used vhs place and the version i bought was the english dubbed version the dubbing is awful so beware lola just wasn't as good in this film as in run lola run and the bad guy just kinda came out of nowhere and lola starts to catch on to what's going on the second she gets to the university seems unrealistic to me i was also wondering if in the original version there were american songs in the soundtrack they seemed extremely out of place too bad for this film i really thought it was going to rock
<START> this feels very stilted and <UNK> to a great extent the whole plot is extremely forced especially the <UNK> effort to save the college from ruin and the <UNK> <UNK> especially by the leading lady <UNK> a bit br br but there are one or two comic moments that do help <UNK> the boredom and the dancing is quite fun especially for alleged amateurs ha ha br br the shop <UNK> and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles <UNK> and ronald coleman as well
<START> this is the most overrated show on television i believe people continue to watch it because they feel they should because it has become somewhat of a cool show to watch and talk to your friends about the next day at work or school rarely does it actually <UNK> anything more than a chuckle and never <UNK> any sense of irony or thought from the audience every joke is <UNK> with <UNK> that seem to be drawn out of a hat the complete lack of originality combined with the even somehow <UNK> spin off it has <UNK> see american dad makes me question the of an audience that continues to keep this horrid show on tv i award family guy no points and may god have mercy on its soul
<START> john travolta was excellent as michael in the movie by the same name i don't think a better portrayal could have been done the movie was funny yet touching michael is a very human angel if their is such <UNK> <UNK> is superb in her role as a reporter as she goes from disbelief to belief bill hurt and robert <UNK> are great as fellow <UNK> each bent on proving the <UNK> of the angel on earth each of the supporting cast is wonderful especially the older woman i do not know her screen name who plays michael's mother one of the <UNK> movies i have seen in years i could watch this movie dozens of times
<START> such a <UNK> movie it's just some stupid anti russian propaganda with a completely <UNK> plot not in any way related to the book br br it looks like the production team got more money from the people who ordered the movie than they will ever be able to get from selling the movie the plot of the movie includes references to some of the real recent events in russian and other parts of eastern europe but puts them in such way that has nothing to do with reality it looks like the movie is a <UNK> <UNK> which helps to portray russia as a place populated by evil people that always dream about killing someone br br an of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes like using the map of <UNK> instead of russia when running news reports showing a crowd with <UNK> <UNK> and commenting that it's russian <UNK> etc br br also there are many bizarre episodes i e a character runs though the red square in <UNK> and in a second he is in downtown sophia <UNK>
<START> the end of <UNK> neatly <UNK> many of the concerns with the coming peak of the world's oil supply as the world population grows so does demand for oil and power as we <UNK> oil and power we come to a peak in production more oil is <UNK> less oil is generated the inevitable outcome is conflict and major change br br this film will be disturbing and <UNK> if you're new to the topic you may react at first with anger and denial because the <UNK> are so grim it should be required viewing beyond politics beyond optimism the <UNK> is <UNK> br br <UNK> is the focus because our suburban living areas will be the <UNK> most <UNK> when the price of energy <UNK> while <UNK> logic would tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a time of crisis the spread out nature of <UNK> will make it difficult if not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles to transport us br br peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by and backwoods <UNK> this issue will be at our <UNK> sooner than we think this film is a <UNK> coherent look at it
<START> this movie was absolute trash the director and stars should be <UNK> from making movies forever the paper thin plot concerns a sleazy director played by the sleazy director now thats acting advertising on the internet for women to star in a snuff movie br br there's no horror at all the girls look strung out and bored the direction is pointless the music is misplaced heavy metal in a library scene and the lighting is awful the director should have <UNK> in a couple more shopping <UNK> full of <UNK> <UNK> and gotten a script sober actors and a few light <UNK> as it is this is one disgusting nasty worthless mess of a movie
<START> <UNK> <UNK> called <UNK> for short works at an auto body <UNK> shop in what has come to be known as the iron triangle a <UNK> twenty block stretch of auto junk <UNK> and sleazy car <UNK> dealers close to <UNK> stadium in queens new york here customers do not question whether or not parts come from stolen cars or why they are able to receive such large they simply put down their cash and hope that everything is on the up and up sleazy <UNK> like these are not <UNK> in the tour <UNK> but iranian american director <UNK> puts them on vivid display in chop shop a powerful indie film that received much affection last year at cannes berlin and toronto a follow up to his acclaimed man push <UNK> spent one and a half years in the location that f scott fitzgerald described as in the great <UNK> as the valley of the <UNK> br br for all its depiction of <UNK> chop shop is not a work of social criticism but like hector <UNK> a poignant character study in which a young boy's survival is bought at the price of his innocence shot on location at point in queens makes you feel as if you are there <UNK> in a hot and <UNK> new york summer with all of its noise and chaos the film's focus is on the charming street smart 12 year old <UNK> who lives on the edge without any adult support or <UNK> other than his boss rob the real life <UNK> of the iron triangle garage performance is raw and slightly <UNK> yet he fully earned the standing <UNK> he received at the film's premiere at cannes along with a hug from great iranian director <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> into a tiny room above the garage together with his 16 year old sister <UNK> who works <UNK> food from a lunch <UNK> <UNK> is like one of the <UNK> spare parts he deals with while he has dreams of <UNK> his own food service van in the city that never sleeps he knows that the only thing that may make the top of the heap is another <UNK> in this environment <UNK> and use any means necessary to keep their heads above water while their love for each other remains constant and they still laugh and act out the childhood that was never theirs as <UNK> <UNK> says in his book dreams from my father the change may come later when their eyes stop laughing and they have shut off something inside in the meantime <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> by selling candy bars in the crowded new york <UNK> with his friend carlos carlos <UNK> and pushing <UNK> dvds on the street <UNK> while does tricks for the truck drivers to save enough money to buy the <UNK> <UNK> van in which they hope to start their own business br br though <UNK> is a good boy he is not above stealing <UNK> and in the <UNK> stadium parking lot events that camera <UNK> without judgment in chop shop has provided a compelling <UNK> to the underdog success stories <UNK> out by the hollywood dream factory and has given us a film of stunning <UNK> and respect for its characters similar in many ways to the great italian neo <UNK> films and the recent iranian works of <UNK> <UNK> and others while the outcome of the characters is far from certain makes sure that we notice a giant <UNK> at <UNK> stadium that reads make dreams happen leaving us with the hint that in phrase the drum of the realization of that promise is beating
<START> music and lyrics written and performed by charlie daniels <UNK> said just don't be expecting anything along the lines of devil went down to georgia ol' charles sorta talk sings through one song early in about the <UNK> mountain duh and that's it for lyrics hey though fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the <UNK> montage my second hand copy is classified as a family film and who doesn't love interminable scenes of <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> the box art made the movie look a hell of a lot <UNK> than it was with the promise that you can lose your life or your mind but mostly it's two couples <UNK> through the sticks and acting natural love that <UNK>
<START> doesn't this seem somewhat familiar oh wait that's right 90 of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series what's the point in repeating yourself you may ask is it for the benefit of the americans who haven't seen the programme did the <UNK> run out of inspiration or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of <UNK> and forgot they'd covered this ground already either way for someone who has sat through the first three series this was just really boring i had to turn it off during the that turn your water <UNK> part yes it is very funny but give us something original for goodness sake actually if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard take on saturday night fever you can forget it br br the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is a <UNK> alright but not half the actor personally i would <UNK> the role as a mark of respect to him or better yet not bothered making the film at all and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself but no they couldn't do that not as long as there was money to be made sad really 4 10
<START> i first saw this mini series as a child and though i am a child no longer i still love it professional copies are hard to find however when it's on dvd it's mine br br great casting marvellous plots and plenty of action romance and even quite a bit of well placed comedy i'm not a <UNK> by nature but i love this masterpiece of historical fiction
<START> i'm usually disappointed by what the media <UNK> lesbian movies these days murderous psychotic murderous lesbians women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end ridiculously good looking women who only get w each other to turn men on etc br br thankfully is on a very high <UNK> above this garbage it is a credible love story acted <UNK> by every cast member down to the least of the supporting actors aside from having a very engaging central conflict the romance between the <UNK> is well developed and believable thanks to cassidy and <UNK> br br i have also seen <UNK> the <UNK> but is far superior to the former both in character conflict development and the quality of the acting br br is both satisfying and enjoyable to watch offering lesbians everywhere a great follow up act to bound
<START> the actors cannot act all was plagued with bad accents and loss of character <UNK> <UNK> never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ever br br the story is nothing new at all some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from you got served and save the last dance i'm not saying that those movies were any good either but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table br br and the dancing there were only 3 dance sequences in the entire movie and 2 of them were taken straight from the commercial perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer but maybe thats what needs to be heard <UNK> <UNK> is not by any means a b boy his little solo in the parking lot had little style technique or any wow factor all of which are part of a street <UNK> <UNK> all of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable <UNK> but nothing more the <UNK> finale left me thinking ok now they're gonna get serious all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen br br i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie but step up is no exception to the rule you got served with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect save the last dance was garbage and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years although i was impressed with <UNK> <UNK> look to center stage for ballet look to beat street for hip hop
<START> the final part of <UNK> trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the <UNK> and <UNK> nature of the cinematic image in red imagery is paramount as well as the obvious but clever color <UNK> however rather than <UNK> to empty aesthetic <UNK> based on the <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> red is a multi layered <UNK> plotted <UNK> on the nature of fate and love in red love and fate are <UNK> but complex notions <UNK> as much by the <UNK> of human beings as the invisible parallel <UNK> that seems to pass us by you sense red is really an allegory a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> gestures in the <UNK> yet it is more than its story appears red demands countless viewings and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already <UNK> plotted structure br br although red stands alone as a <UNK> from <UNK> it's best viewed as part of the trilogy elements of blue and white are <UNK> in red which knowing viewers will enjoy
<START> i wonder how many mini cooper <UNK> were sold thanks to this movie it couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car which is featured in this film along with an attractive cast br br this is a very very entertaining heist and chase film it features a cool cast with mark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> edward norton seth green and jason <UNK> br br the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in <UNK> italy the film doesn't <UNK> the violence has a pretty intelligent script with a few short exceptions features interesting characters and is nicely the cat and mouse game between norton and <UNK> characters is suspenseful and fun to watch br br once again however we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as the good guys how many times has this happened since the days of butch cassidy and the sundance kid in the 1960s it's twisted hollywood for you in here one of the criminals norton stole and killed the leader and father figure donald sutherland of the gang so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain also <UNK> character is in the typically overblown feminist mode of hollywood in which women can do all things including driving a car better than a man a third minor <UNK> is seth <UNK> smug smart ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool br br despite these <UNK> it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex and yes those little cars are cool everyone i've talked to who has seen this film enjoyed it
<START> i watch many movies but <UNK> my genre number one is asian horror i have just bought this dvd and i initially found an intriguing but confused film since i had not understood many parts of the story but i saw in imdb board a message titled explanation of a masterpiece all your questions answered faster load written by and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story i would like to <UNK> for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers br br in the end i agree that is a great korean film but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of i would not be able to understand the story as a whole i intend to see this movie again in a near future my vote is eight br br title brazil fear
<START> the over riding problem with this film is that it can't possibly use bill murray to the best of his abilities simply because of the co star br br if this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue as it stands murray is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter essentially it means that murray is talking to himself and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to <UNK> off br br kids would enjoy this movie simply because of the elephant but anyone wanting to watch bill <UNK> biting delivery and enjoy an excellent script needs to look somewhere else
<START> i have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie and i understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about whether it be the story line animation dialogue and so forth and i believe the most simple way i can answer to this is that it's a movie for a much much younger age <UNK> an age <UNK> much younger than that of <UNK> my neighbor <UNK> br br being a miyazaki fan like the majority of the surfers on this site i expected the wonderful animation music composition complex story telling the great steady development of characters how the story <UNK> with today's society etc etc etc of a typical miyazaki film that we grew up with and to tell you the truth i didn't quite understand what the hell this story was supposed to be about or what the hell was going on until an hour and twenty minutes with twenty minutes left in the movie that this movie is not for the deep <UNK> and hard core <UNK> but for the <UNK> and and happy go lucky japanese people also i believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation straight up grass roots <UNK> studios style br br the fact that a villain is not present really surprised me other than the father and maybe that crazy ass <UNK> but other than that this movie is just plain fun to <UNK> a young one's mind and to make happy good time feeling that's all br br the animation goes back to the old school mid 80s early 90s era of miyazaki's films where very specific detail wasn't a big focus unlike <UNK> princess <UNK> and the latter i admire the simplicity which kind of created some small nostalgia when i first watched <UNK> movies like <UNK> when i was a child the reaction and movement of the children are all very similar to that of kids and a lot of studio body language is very noticeable studio <UNK> added some creative moments and <UNK> that they can only do with it's wonderful animators but it probably won't take the ritual <UNK> <UNK> in awe br br the japanese dialogue also sounded very child friendly and a lot of scenes and dialogues are very very relative from what japanese kids and mothers would say and act the music if very <UNK> and <UNK> i guess you could say similar to <UNK> from beginning to end even the darker scenes didn't seem <UNK> br br in the end this movie is one of a kind just about every aspect of this movie is for children and i waited a whole 80 mins to realize that quite frankly i have never seen a movie told or shown it the way miyazaki did it's refreshing to see that studio <UNK> can still tell a story for a wider and much different scale of audience and still keep that trademark <UNK> impression
<START> the <UNK> woods young happy <UNK> a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure the ingredients are there for a horror delight and director co writer jeff does an adequate job at achieving it it's formulaic <UNK> horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a <UNK> sense is effectively told in certain realism maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone <UNK> but <UNK> makes up for the <UNK> flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a <UNK> atmosphere created by brad very <UNK> lingering score whenever that very creepy <UNK> was <UNK> in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop <UNK> dean m and joel king do a striking job too there's plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the build up is slow <UNK> at times the pacing can become a stop and go affair it's not particularly violent but there's still a mean streak evident even if some of it happens of screen the latter chase scenes and <UNK> fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with its <UNK> killer s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn there's a likable bunch of performances deborah benson makes for a strong dashing heroine <UNK> henry chris lemmon ralph seymour jamie rose mike and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable <UNK> the final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you <UNK> is that it br br a well <UNK> backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm
<START> a beloved and devoted priest from a small town <UNK> for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire br br physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life br br the one time priest falls deeper in despair and <UNK> as things turns for worse he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity br br the vampire movie should have really been <UNK> now thanks to the poor efforts of the twilight and underworld <UNK> but the director <UNK> new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspective br br these vampires have <UNK> and no <UNK> but still feed and die the same making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts the priest primarily <UNK> to make himself better but when he meets his friends <UNK> wife <UNK> instincts set in br br what makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple <UNK> for the first time they are experiencing something they have never before forbidden passion which makes the scenario all that more sensual br br chan <UNK> adds some much needed humour into the film but this is only realised in the final third of the movie we see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone and when she realises her own strength just puts the chair down and carry on hilarious br br and the final act wouldn't be out of place in a carry on film or even the three stooges as the couple fight for survival death respectively br br cgi is subtle and fantastic and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so <UNK> you could be watching ballet br br the vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this but more importantly has the <UNK> and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days it's violent but from the director in question i wouldn't expect anything different br br a really interesting story with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography
<START> a really awful movie about a 30 <UNK> long shark bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete a <UNK> of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost even if u liked jaws which i <UNK> did don't see it even if you have interests in don't see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors corny plots during corny tv time do humanity a favor and do not i repeat do not <UNK> your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci fi animal thriller still some people gave it a ten <UNK> don't know if they were serious or not but sincerely expect they weren't
<START> corey <UNK> plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant <UNK> and <UNK> hit man michael <UNK> with a 30 30 and <UNK> bombs which plays plausible considering <UNK> oh and he also <UNK> his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story corey <UNK> is terrible of course but the movie's sheer momentum as well as <UNK> <UNK> presence make this at least a <UNK> effective film still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been <UNK> if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore at least it's something different also it's fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making <UNK> bombs br br matt bronson 2 5
<START> this film brought a whole new meaning to that well worn phrase <UNK> watching paint because this was <UNK> watching paint dry in the middle of a br br i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of <UNK> which i have visited it is a <UNK> beautiful place and the black and white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty that was the only good thing the story was <UNK> banal and frankly you have to have some story br br a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait well a wait is a wait i can wait for a number 15 bus on <UNK> street in <UNK> i can spend hours on a remote <UNK> station in the middle of nowhere on cold <UNK> sunday afternoon however a wait is boring and yes this wait was boring too br br so the leader goes off to america to with the film <UNK> who <UNK> him for not making the whole thing in colour after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerly <UNK> end finally arrives and not before time br br yes i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of <UNK> of colour film so that i can <UNK> them at the screen
<START> this is an enjoyable movie its very realistic to the wonderful world of music i've been there and done that it shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect these amateur musicians weren't all that bad players <UNK> character marshall tucker was played very well marshall was no saint himself here he was getting paid to do a job and he's giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there you don't bite the hands that feed you i do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has claims he does not know any of the tunes he has a tremendous sense of <UNK> <UNK> changes to tunes he does not know not common but not <UNK> of either he delivers a true and harsh message at the end of the movie when he tells the <UNK> player its not a religion devotion is not enough on that level he is correct although i think the <UNK> player could have handled the job he was practicing his butt off and vocal <UNK> music is not that hard to read very enjoyable movie
<START> i have watched two episodes so far i really like it even though i am no longer in college it makes me miss the wonderful college life i wish that i spent a little more time <UNK> i kind of identify myself with rusty when i was <UNK> a <UNK> my big brother was not like at all i wish that i had a big brother like him so if a show like this can actually make people to identify themselves with the characters then it is a pretty good show br br it is more realistic than american pie with less explicit sex jokes can we also call this a younger version of desperate wives some of the writers must be <UNK> themselves the story seems to reflect somewhat of the real <UNK> and <UNK> life it was shot in high definition and they actually filmed outside instead of inside of studios so the picture quality is very good they could easily make this a good film unlike a movie which can only last a few hours i can have about 45 minutes of fun watching it free on tv weekly br br the casting is excellent the actors are about the right age and they are new and fresh so that makes them more real this show practically is about everyone there are asian and black frat boys and <UNK> girls in the show as well it is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two guys in the <UNK> had sex in first episode then tried to hook up again in the second episode i don't think that i have seen anything like this on tv before this show somehow reminded me about a warner tv show of teenagers called young americans which got canceled in early 2001 in that show a girl who dressed like a man <UNK> a guy and that guy thought that she was a male homosexual br br greek life can be fun but on the same time students have to study for <UNK> etc by the time when people actually have some free time in their lives there is no <UNK> of <UNK> for them to join any more i don't know how long this show will last sooner or later those people will have to graduate college too maybe they will find some new actors for another 4 years of fun college life
<START> bigfoot movies tend to be bad so i'm not inclined to watch them however there were some good commercials on the sci fi channel so i decided to watch a climbing expedition heads into the pacific <UNK> to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the <UNK> leader played by lance and have brought a revolutionary <UNK> <UNK> that could be used to prove the existence and it actually <UNK> some suspense at first the sasquatch is unseen but sees the mountain body heat like the alien in predator and i did wonder when it was going to strike the acting is passable as is the background music the dense <UNK> location is well used and when the creature is finally seen the costume is not bad though nothing great but as the film <UNK> on it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd most of the characters are unpleasant people rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity except for lance character so that it's impossible to care about what happens to them and their behavior become increasingly stupid one man shoots the creature not <UNK> then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark one female <UNK> puts on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> before <UNK> into her sleeping bag then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch without getting her hair and make up messed up then the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the <UNK> <UNK> machine and will let them live if they leave it behind a creature knows what threatens it obviously the instinct doesn't apply to these actors or they wouldn't have appeared in this movie and the ending is so stupid you'll want to kick the tv screen if it weren't for the script it would have been a decent horror film
<START> spoilers cash crop goes something like this down on their luck <UNK> grow pot to make ends meet <UNK> agent blows into town <UNK> hide the pot <UNK> agent leaves town end of story br br this flick features solid performances by some second <UNK> actors mediocre direction and a so so screenplay but it ain't got no story and since the story is the foundation of every drama cash crop is an utter failure too boring to recommend
<START> i had to read i know why the <UNK> birds sing in my english class and we watched the movie after finishing it after watching the movie i regret seeing it completely took away any of the impact the book had the scenes made no sense in their sequences the acting was horrible and it seemed as though the screen writer never actually picked up the book but <UNK> for the cliff notes instead i was <UNK> at how the movie ended almost half of the book was cut out and certain aspects were extremely important to <UNK> growth as a person if you have read <UNK> birds this movie will ruin the experience of the book so i warn you not to see it
<START> this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect <UNK> hilarity truth fun talent and <UNK> that make for magic br br from creative musical numbers to off the <UNK> comedy that <UNK> actors at their very best if i hadn't have known better i would have thought there was an elaborate script here br br what you get a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own <UNK> br br peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately the rest of the cast is also phenomenal there are no small parts only small actors and everyone involved here should be <UNK> on the back taken out to dinner and be considered for an oscar br br well done
<START> the fact that this <UNK> series could <UNK> dozens of comments much less hundreds of speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization br br read <UNK> you morons or at least dave barry or <UNK> and <UNK> br br chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes <UNK> hours viewing this poor <UNK> <UNK> the boards and <UNK> lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service br br please don't watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells
<START> tiny and sly the sneak are locked up in <UNK> for a train ride to who knows where swinging <UNK> begins <UNK> out an <UNK> song as soon as the train leaves the station so lets hope that <UNK> tad gets him this time sly tries out a couple of funny hand tricks but spoil sport conductor man puts the bird in a <UNK> place amongst the <UNK> the <UNK> next attempt has him ending up in the coal <UNK> of the steam engine and the chase is on of course there's a <UNK> too and silly sly just cant keep his big mouth shut br br next up the <UNK> <UNK> tries the old <UNK> of the <UNK> bit twice producing a payoff <UNK> <UNK> would be proud of unfortunately for <UNK> that <UNK> seems to be everywhere he even displays a talent for shape shifting and producing enormous <UNK> from his back pocket not even ability to <UNK> a <UNK> train can save him when he is thrown off silver streak style several times in a row arriving at <UNK> new place <UNK> <UNK> population <UNK> the <UNK> final attempt involves cross dressing but you know what happens to men in dresses they always get more attention than they <UNK> for br br 7 out of 10
<START> this movie is like so many biopic tv movies i have seen formulaic <UNK> poorly acted and most importantly happening too soon br br what i mean by that is the movie was filmed and for that matter aired before michael jackson's <UNK> from his child <UNK> charges which i think was one of the most significant periods of jackson's life and career so far it probably would have made a great ending to this <UNK> drama however this movie already bites off more than it can chew <UNK> too many details in this overly ambitious project br br it's no doubt that michael jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician let alone modern day pop star to date and his story would probably take six behind the music <UNK> to tell accurately this movie tried to tell too much in three hours and needless to say it failed br br <UNK> alexander did what he could in playing jackson but he came off more like an snl caricature by the likes of tim meadows and amy <UNK> it would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays jackson without meeting with the king of pop himself and studying his methods of madness on a <UNK> budget though one can only depend on what they see in the <UNK> and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation br br furthermore the director's efforts to make alexander look like jackson are completely foolish the <UNK> makeup on <UNK> face makes him look more like a reverse <UNK> show and everyone who has been in a <UNK> store knows that jackson's nose is not as big as <UNK> it's also amazing to me that the film documents jackson going under the knife to get <UNK> surgery yet in the next scene alexander still has the same size nose this kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can't hold up to tv viewers in the 21st century br br it was even more distracting when footage of the real michael jackson i e the time he hung his <UNK> child over a balcony in germany was interspersed into the movie in real time it was a nice try but it just didn't work br br if this movie as it is was released into theaters it would gain a profit only because of its <UNK> it even <UNK> in comparison to <UNK> <UNK> and that's saying a lot above all this was a movie that was probably rushed into making like many tv movies that aren't on hbo it could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of jackson's life even if it just covered the child <UNK> <UNK> it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing
<START> a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn't accepted by the <UNK> american academy after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the <UNK> express under the <UNK> to name only few for these he was nominated for the oscar the <UNK> is arguably his highlight yet br br i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses and the oscar goes to jeremy <UNK> daniel day lewis anthony hopkins emma thompson glenda jackson etc and they all deserved the award why they always left sir finney with empty hands br br on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei in cousin <UNK> i don't know should i laugh or cry br br if you have seen the two leads in the <UNK> you won't forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves art br br i give 9 10 for this excellent film 1 point missing for non cinematic material after all it is just a theater br br note my <UNK> is much stronger than this on imdb 10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should could last forever
<START> it takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it o brother does that and then some the first time i saw it i have to admit i had never seen anything like it then i wanted to see it again and now i'm up to double <UNK> with this great movie the <UNK> <UNK> finest movie they've ever done with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> coming in a tight second and third for me br br george clooney gives the performance of his career playing <UNK> everett <UNK> a fast talking know it all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all tim blake nelson and john <UNK> are the perfect <UNK> for clooney particularly nelson and his portrayal of <UNK> a loyal albeit <UNK> fellow <UNK> john goodman is my favorite bit character as big dan perfect it reminds me of his part in raising arizona he's just a perfect actor for this role <UNK> <UNK> favorites holly hunter and charles <UNK> also provide memorable performances br br joel and ethan <UNK> are masters of their trade it's not like they try to win academy awards every time they make a film they just try and tell a story that they want to tell and it's entertaining it's a loose adaptation of the odyssey and i mean loose for all of you homer fanatics it's just great br br the most amazing part of this movie though is the <UNK> i've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and i am still in awe just thinking about it the <UNK> does become an important part of the movie great great movie
<START> first of all no one with any law <UNK> experience not er or but real law <UNK> takes this show seriously walker would be <UNK> out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally <UNK> tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex <UNK> loves him shows just how dumb <UNK> really are and is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why <UNK> is treated as a <UNK> always is the subject of <UNK> jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never <UNK> walker who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more <UNK> than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the <UNK> kid and wild bill <UNK> though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker <UNK> is just as insulting and just plain silly
<START> if you have been to the east of europe or even in their armed forces you might find this movie interesting i don't know why calls this a comedy sure there are a few funny moments but it is not a good movie if one of the <UNK> officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of <UNK> on a christmas dinner and the officers in general act like funny <UNK> the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night and surprise surprise one of the girls is the daughter of the commander the east german army was known for its abusive and <UNK> service of its <UNK> men and the comedy was basically not filmed on the <UNK> or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east german army and their time now gone by despite this some of the actors and actresses tried to act well but it came out only in the roles they're known for from east german tv and some small films i would not recommend this movie to anybody it was basically boring and very cheap made
<START> its been years since i have seen these shows i have been searching years for anyone else that has seen these or know anything about them i thought i made them up the one i remember most is the soldier and death i'd ask movie fanatics if they had seen these mentioning its a jim <UNK> and people still didn't know these are great <UNK> i was very young when i was these not even 10 and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs i would recommend anyone to watch these just remember they are from the 80's so they don't look like the movies today just give them a shot jim <UNK> was way ahead of his time and died to early
<START> i had already heard of ali g in <UNK> music video music i always think he's funny in fact he really is just last year i always thought of buying a <UNK> of ali g that's why some months later i bought it cheap and i started watching it br br but the movie surprised me my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh out comedy it turns out that is just a stupid piece of garbage it was really really bad it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor it also didn't made me laugh even just a big smile we definitely hate that movie oh by the way i have plans to sell it br br ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows in such a negative way maybe he wasn't really well focused and enough serious to make this flick just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious because sometimes too much isn't that laughable anymore for the first time ever i was disappointed at him that really made me sad rather and happy br br i gave this movie 1 over 10 actually i really want to give it a 0 rating it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible
<START> all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other <UNK> this is city of god meets happy days the of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a <UNK> commercial is completely unconvincing you can approach it in one of two ways 1 a gritty realistic movie turned sappy or 2 a sappy abc <UNK> special with profanity violence and animal cruelty either way it just don't fly do it why then has it received so much praise as others have implied it gets the conscience vote from the west show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our <UNK> double wide theatre seats and <UNK> oz <UNK> and we'll applaud in a <UNK> but oh don't forget to candy coat it because the bitter <UNK> of reality <UNK> as it is is hard for us to swallow br br i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and <UNK> especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there all i can say is beware of any film that receives awards hollywood oscars sweeping <UNK> tripe cannes film festival beard <UNK> <UNK> propaganda to find the real gems you'll have to work hard at it
<START> i know the girl who did the figure <UNK> for the lead girl she once dated my brother and she was always really nice i also live in b c about 15 or so minutes from <UNK> steele haha i used to go there for field <UNK> when i was in <UNK> school it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting now i totally wish i did this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay it never came out here which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here so i was excited when it came i really loved the story line and the bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about <UNK> steele just ask away
<START> i get really fed up with sitcoms you feel you always know what is coming so it <UNK> to be funny on the other hand hi de hi you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny i have just purchased the second set of the series series 3 4 and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all again i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors or the many unseen crew members because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves <UNK> and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi
<START> this an extremely horrible movie and if your thinking you've seen another horrible movie exactly like this one before you probably have you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003 yes thats what i said brian the director stole the movie idea and not only did he steal it he actually might have been able to make it worse i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie which will never work
<START> i went to see glenn i sell the dead in it's north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn't quite know what to expect of this film especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation br br i'll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis without giving away any spoilers br br this movie is about arthur blake how he became a grave <UNK> and the interesting and supernatural <UNK> that both he and his mentor discovered br br the costume and set design in this film were excellent i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york the costumes were very accurate to the time really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time this movie works just as well as a period piece as it does a horror comedy br br the interaction between the two leads was very fluid they played off each others acting with ease the dialogue between the two was very well written with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations br br the story is very <UNK> and the ball gets rolling from the very start i'd compare it to a visual page turner always wondering just what will happen next the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself br br all in all i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour with a bit of horror mixed in br br 9 10
<START> a friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched however i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he  or for that matter michael elliott  was the film is a hybrid of house of wax 1953 and the texas chain saw massacre 1974 indeed i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the <UNK> did so we have a remote and <UNK> wax museum of incredibly <UNK> <UNK> guess why that is with its apparently harmless <UNK> a hammy chuck <UNK> being by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers among them <UNK> roberts he also has a mad brother  shades of psycho 1960 <UNK> for good measure down to the self same twist  who is supposed to be a mechanical genius <UNK> in a <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> the first murder the film does benefit from a <UNK> <UNK> score but being so derivative and not especially well made to boot essentially ends up merely a redundant and fairly muddled genre effort
<START> a quite easy to watch tale of 2 thieves with that love hate type relationship between them walken stars and is very good as the silent rogue with a <UNK> bigger than he's letting on
<START> i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years i doubt this one will make it to the realm of <UNK> classic as the other one has if you have not seen the version you might like this one but i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten <UNK> i was kind of looking to see how they told the story and the writers did not do a good job with this one
<START> i cant put it any simpler than that this is a terrible film i've worked in the industry and made several short films myself so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously i absolutely hate this film i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others it is a piece of sh t the writer director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager the characters are unrealistic the lead woman doesn't think of taking the <UNK> pistol yet is <UNK> enough to <UNK> a <UNK> cocktail please and not even likable hell i hated her and <UNK> when she died i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient <UNK> t with no real thought behind it to me this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year <UNK> you now rank up there with such <UNK> as micheal bay in the <UNK> <UNK> be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film club i hope you read this i really do and to the <UNK> idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and <UNK> you
<START> i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to <UNK> from <UNK> ill with two of his high school <UNK> he seemed like a normal enough guy though he had a lot of artistic <UNK> within a few years he jumped into post punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere although it got him a lot of action including a <UNK> with <UNK> love in her <UNK> <UNK> days he seemed to think his musical <UNK> were good enough to move to san francisco then n y c br br i was surprised to hear that he got a <UNK> deal in <UNK> after the band crashed and burned <UNK> <UNK> name seemed to be the <UNK> i have no idea how the movie came about especially with this cast but i doubt that gus van <UNK> was involved anyway the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer or artist or something but doesn't have anything to say like <UNK> without the <UNK>
<START> people criticize because it is a low point in bond god sean <UNK> career and because it is <UNK> may contain spoilers first of all this movie is better then any other bond film featuring any other actor then connery all sub par <UNK> in my book sean connery is the only real bond no one comes even close to his <UNK> good looks and sex appeal yes this movie is a low point in <UNK> bond career but it is still the best bond film of the 80's sean connery is the only bond actor who is good at an older age he did not become a <UNK> mess like moore but kept his good looks and <UNK> but gaining some gray hair so what hes still the only real <UNK> and he is as cool and tough as ever sean connery is the one and only <UNK> and this movie is <UNK> worth seeing no matter what anyone says no gun barrel opening but you can't have everything can you great theme song though
<START> hard to believe this was directed by fritz lang since he mostly directed crime dramas and mysteries this movie has a cast that includes robert young randolph scott dean jagger and john carradine scott plays an outlaw who tries to go straight and leave his old gang and winds up saving <UNK> life jagger works for western union a <UNK> company that plans to have <UNK> out west jagger hires a lot of men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about indian attacks and <UNK> scott is in charge of the men and young is a <UNK> expert who can't shoot a gun but can ride scott meets up with his old gang who want to stop them but scott can't tell anyone it's a pretty good western and lang should of directed some more westerns
<START> this film was the one of the first of the 70s women in prison film genre this movie was incredibly violent with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates the film takes place in the <UNK> which looks like a horribly ugly country no doubt the producers used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were in br br <UNK> movie queen pam <UNK> has the starring role in this movie she plays <UNK> a <UNK> who gets thrown in the vile women's prison on <UNK> up charges her boyfriend played by sid <UNK> tries to rescue <UNK> he and <UNK> are part of a political <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> was <UNK> by the corrupt government br br pam <UNK> and sid <UNK> stand out amongst the otherwise lackluster cast the film itself put way too much emphasis on violence <UNK> against the prisoners their <UNK> just used them solely as objects of their <UNK> this got boring real fast this movie could've used more interesting plot lines and subtlety this is not one of roger <UNK> better pictures the many women in prison films that followed this one were much better all around i'd recommend the big bird cage only to pam <UNK> fans
<START> wow i just watched this movie american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as all indian films have dances songs and a love story its pathetic how far away from the truth that is this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films horrible acting horrible direction horrible cinematography and all this by a hollywood director most indian films today are much more content driven realistic touching and meaningful than this piece of crap indian cinema not just hindi also cover a variety of different subjects just like most other hollywood films these days this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country where truth is thrown out the window this is a highly not recommended movie instead watch good hindi films like black friday <UNK> gangster don <UNK> sholay mother india <UNK> those films are what real indian cinema are all about
<START> a year after her <UNK> first special my name is barbra barbra streisand with her production team to produce this follow up cbs tv special in then revolutionary color first broadcast in march 1966 color me barbra follows a similar format to its predecessor three segments the first two with unique concepts the first takes place in the after hours <UNK> of the philadelphia museum of art where dressed as a period maid she <UNK> the <UNK> and becomes part of the artwork through song in various <UNK> streisand expresses a variety of <UNK> from the comedy <UNK> of the minute <UNK> to the melodrama of non <UNK> <UNK> in a painting to the <UNK> style frenzy of gotta move set to abstract art my favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead <UNK> of queen while singing a haunting rendition of rogers and <UNK> where or when br br opening with another comic monologue full of silly non <UNK> this time in french the second segment is back in the studio for a <UNK> colored circus <UNK> where she <UNK> with animals including her beloved <UNK> <UNK> she finds an appropriate context for sam you made the pants too long with a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> her profile to an with we have so much in common as with the first special the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some <UNK> any place i hang my hat is home where am i going and starting here starting now among them also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 ironically dressed in all white when the special was first released on vhs the <UNK> of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special and a 23 year old streisand is in peak form
<START> just saw this at the cinema i haven't read the books there is nothing new about this film at all br br the bad guys seem to die with a couple of <UNK> no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same ish there are several action scenes but they are very fake filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to <UNK> a fight scene they just move the camera up close move fast and turn the music up this leaves me feeling <UNK> yet again br br i admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal hollywood cheese but i'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably the characters are 2 dimensional we hardly get to know them or feel for them at all the lead has a charming <UNK> accent <UNK> though it seems he hasn't got much to say br br don't bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters
<START> this remake is a complete disgrace so mediocre cheap and <UNK> it wouldn't deserve more than a couple of <UNK> lines br br it's also a cheat with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish acting you're always aware there's a set a camera a fake no direction no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story br br the claustrophobic <UNK> tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original japanese masterpieces <UNK> on 1 2 is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces br br but worst of all the moral <UNK> and unbearable suffering which both <UNK> a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly <UNK> <UNK> is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie man style scares br br if american audiences aren't willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common <UNK> <UNK> to swallow this kind of <UNK> <UNK> instead they fully deserve this pathetic curse the movie itself
<START> once in a while one come across a movie that forces one to <UNK> about <UNK> reaction to people who <UNK> from its definition of normal br br having suffered at the hands of elements left all alone to cope with her tragedy <UNK> into her <UNK> world one which according to her is the real world br br surreal world <UNK> itself on the real her family br br suffering from <UNK> forces us to <UNK> our <UNK> about trying to <UNK> like them are we right to drag them back to our reality when all we have to offer them in <UNK> is pain and suffering what right have we to <UNK> them of their source of happiness what right do we have to take away their joy when we are unable to help them in their sorrow 15 park <UNK> is one of the best movies on social issues showing us the need that any patient needs empathy and not plain sympathy
<START> it was very sensitive very deep it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie susan sarandon made her role as <UNK> mind actress and she realized her role she deserved the award she convinced me with for being a nun the music was very impressive and sensitive really i liked this deep masterpiece
<START> all right guys here's the deal with this movie it's not the best but for all of you 80s kids out there it'll bring back fond memories of your childhood personally i love this movie i still love <UNK> and the care bears so in my opinion if you aren't a kid now or were a kid that loved and or loves <UNK> you won't like this movie at all
<START> first there are some plot holes in this movie we see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game but who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game how did the driver place the package into the <UNK> when he was <UNK> to the <UNK> wheel it is not like he was mr fantastic wow that in just the first 15 minutes the actors are second rate take the bad guy played by patrick <UNK> who exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on tv and some secondary roles in poor movies like this one so most of the acting is like tv dramas i can live with that but the graphics or special effects are horrible the <UNK> game voice sounds like a poor clone of hal from space 2000 what they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from planet of the apes the aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies in most cases the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going the story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage
<START> of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it br br the script seemed to be based on a willy <UNK> style story but it just didn't have anything to it br br if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad br br they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don't think it is possible
<START> amateur camera work aside i thought this movie was very different and unlike all the <UNK> and <UNK> i have read i got something totally different out of the ending than others the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church how they must <UNK> to all the rigid rules and <UNK> but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language yet she <UNK> a lot as does her family then one day they are headed to a church <UNK> and are in an accident from there the parents and her brother change what with being knocked out and saved by jesus warning major spoiler alert or so we are led to believe i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we the audience thinks is an actual <UNK> with the parents and son is in fact all a dream and from the daughter's <UNK> this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son which were totally opposite of how they lived before especially the sex and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder etc look at how perfect that pie is but go back and look at the cake betty makes that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents laying there in each others arms and her brother all whom of which seemed to die very <UNK> even if being <UNK> fits with a dream sequence
<START> out of this movie br br sorry to say this showed at the cleveland international film festival our copy did not have subtitles so i asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the print received not so i was told the director wants it this way br br again sorry to say my french is barely high school <UNK> level more than 3 decades ago much of the initial dialog is in french so i'm sure i missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words br br i've rated this a 1 primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles <UNK> to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an american audience excuse me even if most americans wouldn't know where europe was on a map not even a film festival audience should be assumed to know the native language of a given movie even if a few of us don't know <UNK> i would still expect subtitles for the few <UNK> who aren't sophisticated enough to have expertise in the <UNK> different languages presented i'll put up with this ego from david lynch not from
<START> sherlock holmes and the secret weapon starts in switzerland as the world's foremost detective sherlock holmes basil <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> manages to <UNK> a brilliant scientist named dr <UNK> william post jr out of the country to the relative safety of london but is london as safe as holmes thinks dr has <UNK> a revolutionary new bomb sight that will change <UNK> <UNK> forever he has agreed to give it to the british government but those <UNK> want it just as badly holmes arch enemy professor <UNK> lionel <UNK> plans on stealing the secret of the bomb sight selling it to the <UNK> add the bumbling inspector <UNK> denis of scotland yard dr love interest charlotte <UNK> <UNK> mysterious scientists a puzzling <UNK> message holmes has his work cut out to keep dr alive so he can deliver his bomb sight br br directed by roy william <UNK> sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was the fourth in a series of <UNK> holmes films made between 1939 1946 to feature <UNK> bruce as holmes watson the script by edward t lowe jr scott darling edmund l <UNK> is based on the short 'the dancing <UNK> by sir arthur conan doyle isn't the tradition holmes murder mystery as it's more of a wartime adventure story to neglect what holmes is all about the solving of complex crimes mysteries is a big mistake as far as i'm concerned the involvement of the <UNK> the war as a backdrop to the story feels out of place awkward just didn't sit too well with me the dialogue isn't great professor <UNK> feels almost like an <UNK> as if they couldn't come up with a villain for it as a whole it's far less engaging than other's in the series however at least it's short br br director <UNK> does his usual efficient job but you have to cut it a little slack bear in mind that it was made over 60 years ago it has no real style or imagination lacks both atmosphere intrigue as well br br technically the film is ok if <UNK> the black and white cinematography is fine although i understand that a computer <UNK> version is also available the acting is alright bruce do their usual comic relief turns <UNK> <UNK> in this looks ridiculous i'm glad he changed it for later <UNK> br br sherlock holmes and the secret weapon was a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent entries in the series there is very little by which i can recommend it everything that made the other's so good seems to be missing here leave this one till last watch some of the better ones first for die hard fans only
<START> the basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so i won't bother i'd like to first <UNK> the producer cast directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a <UNK> budget a small <UNK> of standard hollywood fare that doesn't look cheap these people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it this is essentially art for <UNK> sake i know i know some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine i for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge dollar <UNK> br br now to the criticism i feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point it's wonderful when everything works out and the hero heroine saves the day and <UNK> well that ends well what gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength br br when lee was attacked but not severely injured somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide then miraculously his loaded revolver is still in his <UNK> and it actually works after some cleaning and <UNK> finally when lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water once again the croc fails to kill her she ends up with her hand in his her mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger ultimately to blow the <UNK> brains out literally br br i came to the conclusion that having lee go hand to mouth with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph based upon what i have seen the <UNK> attack and continue to hold on until the prey stops struggling <UNK> will spin around and around to <UNK> and <UNK> the prey that happened to the first 3 victims but not to lee she had teeth marks but they were not deep br br i think that the ending would have been better had the croc won frankly thereby proving his <UNK> of the his territory for millions of years but then how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn't get out alive
<START> the blue planet series is without a doubt one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean for five years filmmakers worked <UNK> on the series getting footage that has never been seen by anyone i e in the title the deep br br i highly recommend you watch this series to see the fish outside of the small pictures shown in <UNK> is truly a treat but only a <UNK> in the vast <UNK> of the sea that blue planet covers from the open ocean to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the deepest darkest part of the ocean itself the bbc takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean br br i have to admit one of my earliest dreams in life was to be a marine <UNK> and after seeing this series the dream was <UNK> i have studied the <UNK> of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries on <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and but in all no one has managed to capture the life beneath the waves quite as well as this group of people br br watch the <UNK> <UNK> series in it's entirety i promise you won't regret it
<START> by the acting in this movie it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be <UNK> passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed
<START> perhaps i'm one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent <UNK> of asian <UNK> is so over hyped films like <UNK> or the the eye  which are praised all over the world  simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than frightening well this blunt opinion doesn't go for the south korean gem a tale of two sisters this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror tale that really gets under your skin the plot based on a local <UNK> tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all time greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tension building surely <UNK> feelings of great respect this is one of those few films that are impossible to label the events in two sisters qualify as mind <UNK> horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait besides a mesmerizing story a tale of two sisters also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music good acting and innovative camera work the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger <UNK> behind every door several sequences like the dinner with relatives or the <UNK> appearance in the girls' room are pretty much the ultimate in <UNK> they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i've seen my share of spooky horror a tale of two sisters is a terrific movie adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics a little warning for people with a short attention span though this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time it's also a film that requires repeated viewing even though no one will never really get it for a full 100
<START> the first time you watch this movie you may hate it but the 2nd time you see this movie i guarantee laughs all around the owners of the dogs are so that you can't help but look at them and laugh from the <UNK> toy <UNK> to the <UNK> everything will make you laugh and you may learn every single nut there is
<START> what a lousy movie took me 3 times to finish it the thing i disliked the most was the <UNK> sense of humor jokes made by a 10 years old child not funny pretty annoying actually for example when the detective cant get a place at the bar he yells she's taking it all off and then they all run fast slapstick <UNK> rush so stupid and also a guy sitting at the bar <UNK> fruit to work out his post traumatic stress disorder on the bar and the bartender is <UNK> him with more and more fresh fruit thats supposed to be funny and i mean i love good ol' exploitation gore flicks and saw a lot of terrible movies but his one is plain bad and also the gore is not that exciting don't bother i wouldn't recommend it
<START> this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid notable for its <UNK> of <UNK> stars most of whom had never made a horror film in their life fred astaire melvyn douglas douglas fairbanks jr john <UNK> and patricia <UNK> it deals with the long <UNK> past crime coming back to haunt them it takes the form of a ghostly dead <UNK> for the girl they all loved alice <UNK> but whom they were forced to <UNK> of after an unfortunate incident when she <UNK> their <UNK> fairbanks who was the one responsible for the deed has twin sons craig <UNK> and so <UNK> directs her revenge upon them as well soon one of the latter fairbanks himself and even douglas and <UNK> all wind up dead therefore the remaining <UNK> and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to <UNK> with a couple of sinister <UNK> who somehow do <UNK> i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs douglas died before the film had even premiered though by that time he had already completed another role while it proved own <UNK> <UNK> song but ghost story went through too many changes of mood â while maintaining a <UNK> pace throughout and <UNK> overlong into the bargain â to be anything but a failed <UNK> having <UNK> of sex including full frontal nudity from <UNK> and gruesome make up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old fashioned <UNK> inherent in jack another notable of long standing cinematography
<START> i see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies because it really doesn't hold a candle to the 70's and 80's gold era of horror this is of course where personal taste comes in br br this movie just falls into the category of new generation of slashers in my book the cast is the typical ones 18 24 years and potential models i'm personally quite tired of that image in horror movies the old movies at least had some variation in people one or more fat people and <UNK> in general just plain looking persons of course having a couple of good <UNK> is fine they always been there but when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice <UNK> and <UNK> it's getting silly i mean ok yeah i like to watch hot chicks but not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knife wielding maniac you expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street i think there are of course a few movies with just good <UNK> that is perfectly alright but they aren't many wrong turn is one example of the better ones br br next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about in this poor movie all you get to see is 2 3 frames of sudden high pitched sound scream and music in <UNK> and that's it the little you do get to see isn't very <UNK> at all not for people who have seen some horrors during the years the old school slashers compared to this had much more and better death blood and gore not to mention the killers in those movies who <UNK> the one you'll get to see here br br as for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the that pops up the killer in this one doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion i have to agree with what someone previously stated as well the cgi is something i hate to watch personally i the <UNK> in that sense i'm conservative unless the cgi is really well done but most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to get into the movie a good background story is one very good thing also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of <UNK> that adds very much of the mood and doesn't give you much to think about just as an example keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases i mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail then it's not much content left over for the viewer at all to <UNK> about that's like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime br br why the old school slashers still works at least for some people is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard the exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course i have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies so there are of course not a right taste for horror movies br br but for people out there that might share my opinion here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick
<START> i saw this tonight with <UNK> expectations if <UNK> films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that's generally a good sign however i'm not normally a fan of julie <UNK> generally <UNK> her comedy roles sorry to any fans but it's a personal thing i just don't find her funny in comedy br br this was magnificent though a great performance by all but and <UNK> are exceptional plenty of laughs plenty of pathos great timing and a wonderfully paced film such a coming of age film wouldn't normally be something i'd expect to like so much but i can't recommend this highly enough and watch rupert as he <UNK> into a fine fine actor
<START> the film is about the battle of <UNK> for those of you who don't know anything about it it was the worst battle in the second world war over 1 million people died in the course of the battle this is the only film that i've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between russia and germany what i really liked about it is that the two <UNK> <UNK> and communism were nowhere in the film unlike most american films the germans are not seen as blood <UNK> murderers but what the average german foot soldier was a person br br the film revolves around four soldiers fighting in <UNK> they were transferred there to try and take the city the film follows these men from august of 1942 to early 1943 during this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle br br through the entire film one feels the desperation of the entire battle unlike enemy at the gates the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual <UNK> of the battle this film may be fiction but it conveys what happened in the <UNK> battle in world war ii
<START> this is a good enough movie and you probably won't be disappointed but it again has roy <UNK> right after he did french connection playing a cop with the name they also use the same too memorable from <UNK> at first you'll think you've seen the car chase before if you have his face still in your memory the car chase is a great one but as in many car movie scenes it has some technical and editing errors check puppet on a chain and french connection ii for some other good long intense chases
<START> this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen on a par with blair witch and just as annoying the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that should take <UNK> as there are moments with <UNK> that makes this movie even more annoying i think if they had been <UNK> they might have found a way out then when you think the geek might come up <UNK> even he <UNK> to a nervous breakdown oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something she can really hear something one of these guys must have at least seen scream where they draw your attention to such things it is also a big let down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back
<START> i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed this can can is an authentic explosion of <UNK> de <UNK> like stanley <UNK> and gene kelly musical but in french way and a jean <UNK> nice tribute to his time his friends lovers music and dances it is at same time a show business <UNK> of that age full of affection and french mood it is too a clear tribute to the <UNK> people who likes <UNK> <UNK> will like this picture it is particularly a tribute to <UNK> <UNK> and of course to jean <UNK> father pierre <UNK> you will find hear a <UNK> and splendid colored recreation of some <UNK> master work excellent casting scenery sound effects and music even it tell us about the creation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> obviously it is a fiction story and not very original by the way as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on but the jean <UNK> production is great br br
<START> having previously seen this short on vhs tape with the feature summer stock i just <UNK> every sunday on the tcm site it marked the film debut of 15 year old deanna durbin and of 14 year old judy garland outside of her two older sisters these two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from deanna of <UNK> <UNK> then one from judy of <UNK> with a swing before the two climax with <UNK> the slight plot of this 11 minute film concerns the possible <UNK> of <UNK> real first name which is the way she's addressed here <UNK> <UNK> job at the park because of low <UNK> with the two girls' help you can probably guess what happens from there <UNK> are marked not only with <UNK> and <UNK> musical choice but also with their height <UNK> and movement despite all that they perform quite well at the end and it's almost surprising that m g m chose garland while durbin was already <UNK> at universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut three smart girls was in the early preparing stages judy herself would make her first feature parade at 20th century fox as m g m was deciding what movie she would next star in that would be broadway melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number dear mr gable you made me love you but back to this short every sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them
<START> apparently this was an award winner apparently someone had a gun against his her head and was force to <UNK> <UNK> the movie br br or this must have been a mistake br br this is the most unwatchable movie ever made the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie two little girls get lost in a <UNK> and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask the little girls run into their hero dad and then runs away from him w t f the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this br br the girls obviously weren't trained actors and had no common sense to them they were so annoying and so <UNK> in the movie it not even remotely comedic hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left you can't even listen to this movie without nearly going into <UNK> br br i can <UNK> a better award winner than this garbage
<START> superb silent version of the story of <UNK> although remade in the thirties as if i were king with frank lloyd directing preston <UNK> scripting and ronald colman starring this version is even better barrymore with a <UNK> of comedians plays the comic fool and the wine depressed with a <UNK> that colman could not match the photography is startling in its beauty and <UNK> and the supporting cast particularly conrad <UNK> in his american premiere the incredibly beautiful day and the supporting comics slim <UNK> and hank mann steal every scene they are in br br it is a shame that barrymore did so few first rate comedies among his sound films only his lead in <UNK> century and his supporting role in midnight can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice in this silent movie barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously <UNK> as the king of the fools and <UNK> as in love he even gets to leap around in the <UNK> style of fairbanks most convincingly he also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory <UNK> in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era br br finally a brief word about alan a director known today only for directing the first talking feature the jazz singer in the same year this was released was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his best known work will be your introduction to his other talents if so you could do far worse
<START> i really enjoy this particular production of the the producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences for instance as some day it may happen the little list song is completely updated and a few lines are ad <UNK> throughout the play liberties were also taken with the setting the costumes are not japanese but rather 1920s english although some of the girls wear <UNK> inspired this production is well choreographed with some 1920s dance styles and there are some extra dancing <UNK> and <UNK> to keep your eyes as well as ears entertained during the songs if you're a gilbert sullivan <UNK> these changes may bother you but i think they're fine and i love the costumes br br <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely hilarious all of her scenes make me laugh out loud one of my favorite add <UNK> is when she first makes an entrance the dancing <UNK> annoy her with their antics so she <UNK> at the top of her voice stop it all of the other main characters do a fine job as well i particularly like mark richardson as <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> br br you must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations <UNK> there is no change of setting although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest if there is one draw back to this production it is that the stage makeup wasn't <UNK> for close up shots with a camera foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> everywhere i've seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays and it's a little jarring at first however i hope you'll get used to it and enjoy the for what it's worth a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic
<START> this is a pretty silly film including what may well be the least erotic come on ever to make it to the big screen the heroine <UNK> v 8 all over herself and invites the hero to <UNK> it off <UNK> and yet it also features the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in what is far and away her most erotic performance in those long ago days women even action <UNK> with real <UNK> were a <UNK> and i can still remember the way my jaw dropped when <UNK> took off her shirt revealing the most <UNK> built female back and <UNK> i'd ever seen <UNK> beauty and <UNK> carry the film she could have been a female <UNK> if anybody had had the vision to promote her
<START> i have in the past loved tim burton i loved ed wood edward <UNK> and even mars attacks but i hate this movie the costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done <UNK> things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago then there were all the head cutting scenes which just left me cold and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something i would think yes there were some nice bare trees and <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless
<START> <UNK> is the best sci fi show period for one main reason everything the show attempts it does very well from a technical aspect the music is original and perfectly <UNK> to the show the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv the acting is also great too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said wow where did that agent smith come from its the same feeling that you get watching <UNK> black anthony virginia hey and especially wayne these <UNK> are great and it comes through in this great show br br the plot is second to none the next closest thing i can think of is <UNK> 5 during the shadow wars episodes but this tops even that its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes <UNK> again the <UNK> of the <UNK> relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining i am always <UNK> for the next show br br the comedic episodes are funny the drama episodes are touching and the action sequences are tense the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing <UNK> something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park or seinfeld the drama is even harder whether <UNK> is meeting his mother or the characters face <UNK> <UNK> all is done with heart and intensity lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops this is sci fi br br if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest if you enjoy good television at all if you like good <UNK> plot you owe it to yourself to watch <UNK> br br oh and ben <UNK> owns
<START> i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival in twelve brief but exquisite minutes leonard takes us on a life changing journey as he <UNK> one of the most controversial contemporary social and <UNK> issues facing our society the film <UNK> elegant direction moving performances and a heart <UNK> story <UNK> garner and lucas <UNK> <UNK> as the two lovers and in his first venture into dramatic narrative leonard proves to be a director with a <UNK> future i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film it's difficult to describe talent but as this debut film demonstrates you know it when you see it
<START> beautifully filmed acclaimed director hugh hudson <UNK> of fire creates a story that brings the entire legend of john <UNK> lord <UNK> and tarzan of the apes to life with <UNK> and dignity and with a scope not <UNK> seen in tarzan films christopher <UNK> makes his starring debut as the young lord raised in the wild by a female gorilla after his parents die in africa later returned to what is to him an alien world that of class and <UNK> he feels totally out of place once he learns what has happened to the apes that raised him and their world he realizes that he must go back a sad but <UNK> story told against a background of fantastic <UNK> this is one of those films that is a must for every collection
<START> a terrific b feature a virtual two <UNK> and set over the course of a day you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play and although only <UNK> minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps <UNK> <UNK> trapped in her own home both are superb especially the under rated <UNK> whose initial independence and self control soon <UNK> before <UNK> unhinged intruder today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry <UNK> much better known as an art director only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock
<START> menace is not funny it tries hard too hard but rarely brings a smile there is no acting just <UNK> one of the main characters wears a stupid <UNK> on his face the entire movie no doubt as the less talented wayans brothers starred wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent br br menace consists of a series of unfunny one joke skits the punchline can be seen a mile off but you have to wait until it all unfolds no <UNK> one liners or snappy dialogue here just one scene after another building up to the joke the jokes themselves are juvenile <UNK> dog the one with the <UNK> <UNK> talks to a beautiful woman but then she has bad breath and then she picks her nose and then wait for it remember you must always w a i t she <UNK> how funny is that ten year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before <UNK> if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing the challenge will be getting drunk enough to <UNK> your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out
<START> not being a particular fan of westerns i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an i love lucy or lucy show type of role here she plays christine <UNK> owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in who's about to be married to the <UNK> local indian agent dean jagger <UNK> performance was ok nothing really more than that she didn't blow me away it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i'm <UNK> to seeing her in there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout a typical funny line there's two ways to deal with women and no one knows either one of them i didn't find the story all that compelling although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent there's typical shootout action and a lot of horses your typical western in other words as to christine we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up it's just a question of how she's going to get there if you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in if you're not big on the genre this will be lacking i'm not big on the genre 3 10
<START> the film is partly a thriller and partly a public service <UNK> when seeing the events through the perspectives of politicians terrorists and of course victims in this smart drama lessons are given about <UNK> and surviving chaos while meantime the <UNK> look at the way crisis is managed <UNK> viewers to <UNK> <UNK> and to be scared by <UNK> the film originally aired on bbc gets to <UNK> effectively doubts on official performances are proper understated though never terrific the flick is just a beginning a provocative start leading to a larger discussion but it gets to work in my opinion giving the right thrills and causing the audience to reason and to ask itself questions
<START> they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie that sounds about right br br this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen <UNK> it's not as bad as <UNK> but that's like saying <UNK> <UNK> wasn't as bad as <UNK> hitler br br tom has been living in france with his french wife and 13 year old son he has been pretending to be french all this time he reveals to his wife that he is actually american for some reason this comes as an earth shattering reveal for her despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent also their son remember he was born in france and never knew his father was american speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie br br the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to <UNK> youth in new york city during the 1970's as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france his best friend as a boy was <UNK> a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams i assume duchovny thinks that retarded is someone who is just sort of dumb because <UNK> comes off only mildly slow at times while other times he comes off as just robin williams yes williams actually fits in his tired <UNK> <UNK> although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow br br <UNK> mother played by <UNK> wife tea <UNK> is a <UNK> popping nurse who is <UNK> over the recent death of her husband <UNK> does a good job but she mainly just <UNK> a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important the script didn't give her much to work with tommy also befriends a lady whom he calls lady who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window this house of <UNK> is called house of d for short thus the title tommy has no <UNK> yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this <UNK> <UNK> can offer him advice and he does so many times without care br br i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as well bad real bad real real bad near the end of this train wreck the script gets <UNK> and <UNK> and ends with a laughably crappy ending br br critics <UNK> house of d apart and rightfully so i can't believe some people actually like this movie it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards not from emotion but from how terrible it was
<START> <UNK> the movie is the real life story of ryan <UNK> and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend 1 a <UNK> <UNK> who lives for nothing and 2 a trying to be funny scientist which doesn't really work played by <UNK> and br br the film <UNK> the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by <UNK> and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to br br the films also stars girlfriend jennifer who plays <UNK> girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a k a <UNK> played by which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring but worst of all is character the voice sound like a <UNK> who basically has throat cancer also i think he could have been improved overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character br br to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time br br towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan <UNK> although a lot of the attention is on <UNK> and brandon br br in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music 7 10
<START> <UNK> in her <UNK> movie br br she <UNK> the femme fatale role in an astonishing way while in the same time she manages to appear a super sexy woman while keeping the sweet girl stand and not being over wicked like other similar movies e g femme fatale with rebecca br br until this movie lord of the rings was the only movie i ever saw her im hooked on with lotr br br point by lotr i had shaped an opinion that the role of the pure sweet woman was the only role that <UNK> could interpret but when i saw one night at <UNK> cool i absolutely changed my mind she is the <UNK> woman ever br br therefore as a film is a mediocre common comedy with a confusing plot
<START> i finally rented this video after searching for it for many months initially i only wanted to see it because i'm an out and out neil <UNK> fan patrick boyfriend of <UNK> the lead however the movie stands up very well without neil although he handles himself very well in this movie he is overshadowed by the three main female characters it's an eerie intense movie the sort the brits do so well definitely a chick flick the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost <UNK> heights aura the movie is full of tension and the ending shocking yet somehow inevitable i'm glad i watched it it was worth the wait
<START> let's see cardboard characters like muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug <UNK> on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped you'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for <UNK> get their just <UNK> turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world the world of religious fantasy complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of <UNK> <UNK> everybody gets dragged off to hell except for one poor <UNK> who goes to heaven where he can presumably spend eternity with the <UNK> that created this masterpiece of the absurd i think i'd <UNK> for <UNK> myself go see something else unless you are stoned in which case you might actually like it couldn't hurt
<START> the <UNK> version of enchanted april manages to be simultaneously tedious br br and <UNK> it is difficult to show the <UNK> magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to <UNK> the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is <UNK> in the cut from the first day to a week later rather than develop the screenplay <UNK> a switch and the br br characters are different br br the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their <UNK> and or <UNK> br br jessie ralph has the most fun moving instead of entirely chewing up the br br scenery and <UNK> alexander has some poignant charm out of her br br husband's shadow and away from his hideous <UNK> ann <UNK> is br br <UNK> here with the production code being <UNK> she had an br br appropriate line in an earlier pre code movie when ladies meet you're br br not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you but in enchanted april can only look hurt rush out and <UNK> to her <UNK> husband
<START> just after watching the first one and it is very dumb i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the <UNK> hour the <UNK> hour should be embarrassed br br it is so weak stewart introduces himself as a government scientist no mention of what kind of scientist just general stuff in a program about <UNK> they bring a caretaker who was paid to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to a church and made him <UNK> before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on now thats science at work br br there is a dumb not good dumb bit where <UNK> <UNK> at a tv that <UNK> skin scream that makes you look younger shouting it's a lie as his randy female assistant gets <UNK> by the local hot <UNK> next door br br the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady named after daddy in order to move the clunky plot along waves at <UNK> from the street as she gets in a taxi <UNK> is one floor up and he looks out a window <UNK> going she got away he could like try to run down or maybe ring the cops or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending br br pity it's so stupid at one point a <UNK> father is convinced by <UNK> that even if a <UNK> clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul yes that's right folks the general scientist <UNK> against <UNK> on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone br br although the general scientist <UNK> finds <UNK> a bit <UNK> he's all up for <UNK> cell research and goes as far as to say that <UNK> will <UNK> humanity if it isn't allowed he has a pretty <UNK> rant about how important it is of course he doesn't mention a single example that kind of sums up the show buzz words and
<START> this cartoon is not right lol i totally disagree with a lot of things it portrayed however it ended on a positive note but as for me and mine we will not be viewing this in our household mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon just <UNK> what most white people feel black people act like br br the comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious he was white that really offended me that's not something we as black people take lightly conscious is a state of being that black people achieve when they realize their true ability
<START> james cagney the <UNK> <UNK> dandy boy was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys <UNK> school which is being run by corrupt the <UNK> school inmates are <UNK> from the streets of new york like the east side kids who were poor and for during the great depression in the final scenes there is a trial held by the <UNK> school boys with <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden i noticed that they did let the horses out of the <UNK> first this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why
<START> i have to admit i am <UNK> about my vote on this film but i have strong reasons as i know some of the true history that was given the hollywood treatment here <UNK> <UNK> novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can't be used in a way this film is all smoke mirrors even though it was released in 1946 it was filmed shortly after casablanca ingrid bergman is at her most <UNK> in this movie as a brunette br br she plays a beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get a rich husband today that is a gold <UNK> but in this social era she is <UNK> the kind of woman who makes all the men want her all the old <UNK> society types talk of her avoid her while wishing they were her ingrid is at her best plays this role well br br some sympathy for character is raised in the new orleans section of this film as she manages to get a decent <UNK> tomb for her mother as part of the <UNK> by her relatives to get her to leave new orleans the <UNK> family of relatives there are so by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town br br gary cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging a bit to play a dashing <UNK> bachelor <UNK> he pulls it off well considering that <UNK> which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking <UNK> as <UNK> maid got nominated for an oscar as supporting actress in this film jerry austin as was over looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film does it well br br when the film moves to <UNK> it depicts accurately how important <UNK> was in that era i like the sequence when bergman walks to the spring to get some of the <UNK> water which everyone considered so healthy then when she drinks some she forces herself not to make a face and comments how good it is that she must have more br br the real history is the <UNK> battle which really occurred on the <UNK> line in tunnel new york which is the actual <UNK> <UNK> the film title is derived from this battle actually happened in between agents for andrew j p morgan the line was the economic key to the country in connecting coal country the east coast the references to it are throughout the film are very real there is even some dialog describing as a <UNK> though the reference is vague unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle br br the <UNK> line the <UNK> tunnel in tunnel new york <UNK> code still exist although the film was shot in california the real tunnel is about 1 mile long it is still part of a key <UNK> line today years after this occurred i grew up there gary <UNK> line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right it is still mighty pretty country
<START> this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their <UNK> year in <UNK> which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location br br the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere there are some clichés about the countries but most of them are true the characters could not better represent their different countries br br having experienced <UNK> on myself during my <UNK> in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic i had many experiences which were similar to the characters except i didn't get laid as often the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies br br finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life br br 9 10 i may not be very objective though
<START> <UNK> from <UNK> is a delightfully compelling film br br within the shifting <UNK> of values in middle class americans from 40 years ago to the present day the plot <UNK> the concerns and hopes of an interesting range of damon characters br br their struggles with moral <UNK> on what might have been ' hopes to yet fulfill youthful dreams romantic <UNK> and hit it <UNK> combine to make a most entertaining film rather than relying upon in your <UNK> sexual <UNK> the <UNK> relationship between <UNK> and mac <UNK> is <UNK> subtle but clear his the <UNK> in her at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is outstanding br br the <UNK> crisp writing is <UNK> interpreted by an outstanding star and supporting cast one of the few films i have ever to see twice in its opening run <UNK> from <UNK> definitely <UNK> national distribution br br conrad f
<START> i was a little afraid when i went to the cinema to see this movie indeed it is always tough to make a movie from a comics and the first episode of the adventures of the french two greatest heroes was good but not fantastic finally it is very funny from the beginning to the end with unexpected gags some cartoon scenes no great fx a great cast great landscapes great everything br br however i wonder how they will manage to translate all the french names in english or german because it is certainly funny in french but how will it be in another language
<START> this odd little film starts out with the story of bruno alex <UNK> in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday he likes to wear dresses and his <UNK> mother angela who is a doesn't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes angela complains to mother superior kathy bates but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they're car they are <UNK> by the other kids and are <UNK> with eggs <UNK> father <UNK> gary <UNK> is divorced from angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically <UNK> him bruno meets a new student at school named who is a free spirit and dresses like annie <UNK> with cap <UNK> angela has a heart attack and <UNK> grandmother steps in to take care of him when <UNK> refuses br br the film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved angela has a great deal to do with bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him <UNK> was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help bruno when he needs it the catholic school that bruno <UNK> is very <UNK> and all the kids run rampant and even call the n word once shirley <UNK> steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented so to speak spoiler alert the ending after the spelling <UNK> is incredibly contrived and feel good <UNK> and cheers for bruno as <UNK> follow him and take his picture for their papers all the while shirley <UNK> is acting like the tough old broad who <UNK> at everyone there is one thing about <UNK> character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the <UNK> nature of her i think the character of helen might be a lesbian she's very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of <UNK> with bruno and <UNK> a <UNK> at the same time i don't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all this is why i think her character might be gay lots of other good actors appear in the film as well joey lauren adams jennifer <UNK> brett butler <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on i guess when they heard that <UNK> was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it very difficult to feel any <UNK> or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to the actors are not bad but what exactly was <UNK> aiming for tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression we get that in the first 10 minutes the rest of the time i was trying not to cringe
<START> this movie is awful beyond belief it's a low budget badly written piece of pointless garbage but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television the badness of this movie is epic maybe not ed wood epic but close the premise is hysterical men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in <UNK> football <UNK> the pseudo dyke culture is laughably bizarre there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service <UNK> and the last man of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show i didn't get to see the end of it which i have to assume was so dripping with <UNK> what have we all learned from this nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth but everything in the first two thirds was so <UNK> bad even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy stupid brainless sci fi b flicks
<START> i loved this show but then i don't remember ever not loving anything he did starting with <UNK> of emily a town sheriff who keeps trying to steal the town blind and ride off to mexico gotta love it like everything he does it has a tongue in cheek flavor that <UNK> it as a garner product james plays the same character in lots of his shows and movies but somehow it never gets stale br br p s re killing off the main character br br if i remember right the good brother was killed off and replaced with the evil twin in an effort to increase the ratings i e make it more like every other western on tv at the time i think this show was too far ahead of its time and i still miss it tv without a jimmy g show is missing something
<START> spike <UNK> books and plays have defeated film makers over the years and <UNK> is sadly no exception the novel set in <UNK> concerns the of ireland in particular its effects on a <UNK> community the of the title due to a <UNK> <UNK> half the village is now in northern ireland the other half is in the republic locals go to the <UNK> at the bottom of their gardens to find a <UNK> wire fence <UNK> their path <UNK> crowd like into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper <UNK> a dead man has to have a <UNK> made out in his name before villagers can reach the to bury him br br is a sort of irish <UNK> milk <UNK> with comic characters and surreal happenings <UNK> the lead character dan <UNK> <UNK> in the film is played by sean hughes and has conversations with the narrator richard attenborough also in the film is milo <UNK> rhys jones david kelly from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jones joe <UNK> and elliott <UNK> br br interviewed for the <UNK> of documentary writer director <UNK> ryan expressed <UNK> admiration for the book it shows on screen but alas like the ill <UNK> film of 'the <UNK> guide to the <UNK> a good book does not necessarily make a good film the trouble with is that like <UNK> other books they simply do not work on the big screen is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot br br no way can the film be compared to train <UNK> like <UNK> lives of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> vampire <UNK> but then neither is it as good as it should have been the last half hour involves a lot of running around by the police the british army some locals who have <UNK> <UNK> in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through <UNK> decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film br br the other problem is the total absence of charm had this in <UNK> while the <UNK> <UNK> television series was funnier by far spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it his daughter jane has a cameo as bride br br the highlight for me though was the <UNK> at the beginning i don't mind dying said spike i just don't want to be there when it happens
<START> i'll not comment a lot what's to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about reality awful <UNK> en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some music it's beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the <UNK> you'll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it it's the rap sing in the final credits pathetic doesn't it etc etc it has been a long time i haven't seen a movie so bad
<START> i thought this was movie was great richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have great chemistry in this movie <UNK> character plays a women who has fallen head over <UNK> in love with richard <UNK> character they end up getting married and everything seems perfect except <UNK> <UNK> wants a baby more than anything however she has a hard time trying to <UNK> richard <UNK> will do anything to make her happy and will go to extreme <UNK> to make her happy i thought the acting was great in this movie and it keeps you guessing it shows how naive one can be when they have fallen in love <UNK> <UNK> is a good actress in this and i wonder why she never made it further in her career richard <UNK> is very impressive as the <UNK> husband and plays the evil part very well i wonder why certain actors make it and certain ones don't all and all a great movie that i would recommend
<START> they did it again ripped off an old show's title then destroyed the nostalgia with boring re imagined stuff the <UNK> cartoon was one of the funniest of its time a good natured satire of super hero comic books the character was drawn as 1 2 way between animal and human the way mickey mouse is here they use a real that's about the same as making a mickey mouse watch with a real rat br br most of the clever <UNK> that made the original show funny is missing from this film instead we get a clumsy ex police dog who's even dumber than <UNK> and some pet owners who add nothing to the story cheesy effects the dog talking animation is embarrassing poor scripting a stereotyped dwarf playing simon bar sinister the <UNK> noise box guy they hired to voice underdog is painful you'd think they'd at least gotten a voice <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> distinctive voice for underdog but no there are at least a few <UNK> references to the source material such as the <UNK> lines which lift it to a 4 br br only small children that love dogs may enjoy this everybody else should get a dvd of the original cartoon series watch this only in desperation
<START> i really don't think it's necessary that i write a review on a movie with a title as <UNK> as snake island but even in the abstract confines of its own genre this hit a new low so my anger must be known the only reason why i even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because i knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night i could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for <UNK> it became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful but it <UNK> below even those expectations br br the movie was directed and written by wayne crawford who also stars in the movie as a tourist guide on the african river who ends up having to <UNK> his team on a remote island called snake island until another boat comes down to pick them up they hang out get drunk and then become subject to the <UNK> of <UNK> snakes who are on a mission to <UNK> their island of human beings br br if your jaw dropped at the last sentence of my second paragraph don't bother to <UNK> it you got it right the first time frankly i prefer my creature features when the creature s just attack the dumb humans out of <UNK> not because they have some kind of a mission these aren't mutant snakes they're not giants like what you see in <UNK> they're just ordinary everyday african snakes like and they have the brains to form <UNK> take up causes work together to trap people understand our language and even dance did your draw drop again well it's going to drop further amount <UNK> through this awful b movie about the part where i'd already given up the human characters start drinking around a <UNK> and then all of a sudden they break down into some kind of an orgy and while they dance nude and such the snakes hunting them all of a sudden stop and start <UNK> along to it the combination of this scene and the scene where we discover that snakes some the most <UNK> creatures on the planet have formed an alliance against human beings for some oddball reason proved just too much for my poor brain and just when i though the filmmakers couldn't take it to an even lower level the snakes started to sing br br the people in the movie well let's just say that never before have i <UNK> for the creatures to kill everybody off so quickly i just could not stand it any longer br br i really don't think i need to keep going on you get the picture if there is anything that makes snake island any different from its other rivals it's that it does dare to try to be even dumber and that's not a <UNK> achievement continue to subject myself to these really bad movies i guess i'll never really know but snake island hits a brand new low it's a cheap trashy excuse for a motion picture that makes <UNK> a brainless snake movie look as brilliant and sophisticated and thrilling as steven spielberg's jaws you have been warned
<START> in this tv special jon is the one who needs a life the highlight of his day is counting the on the ceiling and <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> not content with this forever jon takes garfield to a self help group in order to meet people how many people will be interested in a loner 20 something who's best friend is a cat br br after several failed attempts at getting a girl including one <UNK> dance scene that rivals david <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> hammer in the office dead says jon he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself br br naturally they get on but garfield is worried that john will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat fortunately <UNK> new girlfriend is <UNK> to cats br br with <UNK> animation than past tv <UNK> this feels like a longer episode of garfield and friends
<START> my goodness and here i thought that there were no directors worse than uwe boll br br imagine the number of decisions necessary to produce a motion picture <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dialogue editing casting set and prop design location selection acting timing cinematography lighting music sound and video editing direction br br now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong br br result dracula 3000 br br for a film supposedly set in the this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap <UNK> flick of the 1970's the set is ridiculous for the period the dialogue is atrocious the timing of each scene is ludicrous the acting is beyond abysmal everything stinks br br let's just take props for example if you have a movie set on a space <UNK> built in how likely is it that it will have the exposed <UNK> and <UNK> doors of a 1960's era oil <UNK> what technology hasn't changed in <UNK> years the uses a standard <UNK> keyboard and radio shack to <UNK> the computer what they haven't figured out voice control yet of course the <UNK> is <UNK> to a wheelchair with <UNK> even though you know they've got <UNK> <UNK> but apparently not even a <UNK> wheelchair much less a floating one or <UNK> legs or something and apparently this <UNK> was carrying an <UNK> of <UNK> how convenient then there are the weapons the crew carry standard late 20th century <UNK> in a ship in the <UNK> of space where one would kill them all nice planning there prop department br br oh why go on
<START> this film could have been great but wasn't amongst the <UNK> of talentless no <UNK> and friends of the film makers who wanted to help out there are some mild <UNK> of talent the main star of the film plays a good lead role he is convincing and has those scary italian eyes however he is teamed up with the worst rejects of actors anyone has ever come across the opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing it looks like gay porno fortunately no one stripped off the rape scene that keeps being mentioned is rubbish the prison sequence was the best part of the film although irrelevant the movies soundtrack if you can call it that sounds like a teenage boys first attempt at using and some <UNK> <UNK> it is boring repetitive and extremely lame in fact the whole film is lame get out while you still can
<START> the beauty the terror the poetry the horror the innocence the guilt br br maybe that's just about all i should write in this comment for a tale of two sisters the best thing is to just watch this movie without knowing anything about it i myself didn't even know one single thing about the history of the two girls when i went into this movie i just took a look at the nice cover art didn't even read the synopsis on the back and popped it into dvd player i only knew that it won several <UNK> on festivals around the world and that it came highly recommended br br the dvd cover read the most frightening film since the ring the grudge and dark water though the frightening part might be right you can forget about the rest because the only thing a tale of two sisters has in common with those movie is a ghostly <UNK> with long black hair it's even a bit unfair to compare it with those famous japanese movies because this korean movie has a lot more to offer and is in fact a bit more complicated and intelligent than those others br br this movie simply is a small masterpiece and here are some reasons without telling anything about the plot the movie itself caught me off guard at least two times with clever surprise twists and just when you think you've had the conclusion whether you get it or not that's irrelevant for the moment and you think the movie will end this movie goes on a bit longer the cinematography is amazing using bright colors during the day and dark shades at night the camera work is excellent with the director sometimes choosing impressive if not <UNK> angles some shots are pure poetry e g the top shot with the two sisters at the lake it all looks very stylish there are only four main characters but the intrigue surrounding them is intense the story itself starts a bit slow but there's a lot of variety in tone and emotions to keep it interesting there was even one scene when the girls took off towards the lake that suddenly had me remembering peter jackson's heavenly creatures but when the horror kicks in it's quite effective there are also a few successful surprise scares in it damn i jumped right up from my <UNK> the musical score is great and at times when it's not supposed to be scary i couldn't help but <UNK> that it had sort of an italian feeling to it a bit strange for a korean movie but nevertheless a great score so much care went into every detail of this film including a perfectly balanced surround sound br br i also think that calling a tale of two sisters just a horror movie is giving it not enough credit it's more a mysterious horror drama that works both on a psychological and supernatural level no matter how you look at it this is asian horror that ranks way up there amongst the finest it might not be gory but it gets pretty scary at times and the subject matter is pretty disturbed so if you haven't seen it yet then find a copy pop it into your dvd player go with the flow and make sure you give this movie your full attention for it's <UNK> minutes running time br br there i hope i did a good job <UNK> it without spoiling anything
<START> the role of <UNK> in the <UNK> north american market must have always been <UNK> in the <UNK> of the <UNK> creation persons and <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> works <UNK> surely realized the opportunity of the north market with the purchase of fuel and number of <UNK> purchased per household this type of economic <UNK> <UNK> the concept of speed <UNK> br br after the new <UNK> of japan the <UNK> of the isolated island nation of japan must seek opportunity once again via economic with its global neighbors this also helped spark the economic opportunities in the european and north american market if not the global market br br speed is a young avid driver who without knowing any better is driven by his demanding father pops <UNK> who has challenged himself his whole life to make a better machine better at winning races it was in fact pops <UNK> who drove his first son rex <UNK> to the brink of destruction with his <UNK> of how to best use the technology he developed as a mature <UNK> rex finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels <UNK> to his younger bother speed br br the exact relationship of rex <UNK> to persons such as the inspector are never really clear but put into <UNK> rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known speed was in trouble or the fact that the situations involved some types of illegal activity were his <UNK> knowledge is against an evil plot this brings a level of cloak and <UNK> romance to speed <UNK> br br the mixture of <UNK> innocence with and <UNK> <UNK> brings a level of comic human nature this concept is a good form of <UNK> to balance the themes and plots as they are played out from episode to episode so instead of a dry detective story the thrill of international race car driving romance of cloak and <UNK> and comedy of human nature is put into one story speed <UNK>
<START> like its near <UNK> the great race and those magnificent men in their flying machines i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year on new year's day we'd visit my <UNK> and after lunch while the adults talked the kids would watch tv where <UNK> one of these three crazy race films would be on br br for that reason alone i really wanted to mark <UNK> <UNK> or bust well but i fear i can't the child not being father to the man on this occasion by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally in truth i really wanted all the <UNK> to get to the end of the race long before they actually do br br of course it's dated by its stereotyping of <UNK> and woman as the weaker sex and i also didn't much care for one or two stray admittedly mild <UNK> which occasionally <UNK> more than that though the cast despite <UNK> it up outrageously just don't sell the film enough tony curtis in a trial run for his <UNK> abroad turn in the tv series the seems too old to be playing the young <UNK> terry thomas just isn't <UNK> enough eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirty minded <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> as an overdone <UNK> is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was <UNK> best villain <UNK> if anything the come off best susan <UNK> is at least engaging as a bright young thing suitably <UNK> as a posh <UNK> and although <UNK> to the <UNK> of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types although even then the carry on team did this so much better in carry on up the pass br br director <UNK> tries everything to evoke the golden <UNK> with <UNK> of slapstick mistaken identity <UNK> <UNK> up camera shots would be dramatic stunts and some light romance but there's no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race off at the end seems like another br br actually i'd have given it another mark if they'd stuck to the alternative title those magnificent men in their <UNK> but in truth the animated series wacky races did this so much better
<START> i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters much in the manner of <UNK> than on the life of victor herbert but in the 1930's would that have been a box office draw instead of the life of <UNK> perhaps it should have been the music of <UNK> there is an abundance of this br br for me the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when <UNK> foster sings land of romance it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local <UNK> <UNK> theater at first the audience was stunned then it burst into spontaneous applause i remember the <UNK> running up and down my spine my trivia memory <UNK> the information provided to an <UNK> public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's <UNK> note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c ' br br she may not have had four <UNK> a la but the then teen <UNK> certainly had a range
<START> i adore this film as much as any one <UNK> viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth this film is forever <UNK> in my brain for someone who didn't grow up around this film you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid 90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem cool this is as my <UNK> was <UNK> up on better off dead before i saw this of which i raped loved and no one no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies because with all the <UNK> of slow mo the current soundtrack the new tech i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots this is the teen comedy yes
<START> i'm not sure who should be blamed for this <UNK> in truth the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made for disney movies have been the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type the acting is more than a bit two dimensional but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with br br however it's <UNK> in my book to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a <UNK> pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life if the girl can't sing have someone who can record the music br br this actress is a terrible singer she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key
<START> i usually don't <UNK> a moving as boring i am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be <UNK> during a movie in fact i enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line unfortunately this movie has none of those characteristics diane lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting none of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience i guess the scenes where the <UNK> are <UNK> somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill space the scenes appeared choppy and incoherent there were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach which were beautiful
<START> remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old vhs <UNK> the fallen is just a bad executed remake of those movies the story is terrible the direction is terrible the editing is terrible the music is terrible and all together make an unbearable nightmare br br it is also terribly slow very slow i tried to sleep while watching it but i couldn't do it because i had nightmares of it br br please don't watch this movie it is that bad ten lines is a lot so i don't know what else to say br br press the <UNK> button now and you wont regret it
<START> being a science fiction fan from my early childhood long time since i always hated implausible plots it's a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience i always suspected them of thinking children are to dumb to realise so we don't have to <UNK> the writer of science fiction 2002 is no exception the story is about a boy who is <UNK> by his new friends to spy after his parents because they think that the parents are aliens as intriguing the idea sounded to me as much was i bored by its <UNK> it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by <UNK> it into a dark stylish and <UNK> slow atmosphere the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish and then bang they did not even try so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents go and watch 2002 instead
<START> get <UNK> was an excellent film it was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot be cool is like some cheap knock off trying to pass for a sequel john travolta as <UNK> <UNK> seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob he plays it like he's a bored movie <UNK> rather than a bored movie <UNK> who used to be a <UNK> uma thurman great in nearly every role she's ever played comes off as strained and confusing is she supposed to be <UNK> or clever the chemistry between her and travolta is strained and uncomfortable other than that just add every movie cliché you can think of a well educated rap producer by cedric the entertainer an inept gangster wannabe in andre 3000 the girl with heart soul and a good set of <UNK> in christina a <UNK> black dude wannabe in vince vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by stephen tyler the only funny part was the rock who <UNK> his own new cliché as a gay <UNK> bodyguard actor wannabe probably the biggest crime is the plot it makes no sense get <UNK> was clever with <UNK> playing one group against another and coming out on top but this film tries that with about a million different characters and even <UNK> doesn't seem to know what's going on fans of get <UNK> be warned this is a very different very worse movie
<START> this is a <UNK> that you can safely avoid childish plot and poor acting from cameron she really shouldn't take on these serious roles they don't suit her besides she looks most <UNK> lets face it great in <UNK> angels and she was superb in there's something about mary the <UNK> wouldn't be a good president of the usa and vice versa my point being that there are some actors actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and cameron is most <UNK> for this serious housewife type there are a dozen other <UNK> would have done a far better job the movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot did i spell right i noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given the box a 10 rating who was <UNK> in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell i mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't c'mon <UNK>
<START> i was also disappointed with this movie for starters the things that happen to him don't seem too terrible to me sorry male <UNK> <UNK> as is <UNK> said by one of the lady <UNK> most men would pay to be in your position to which he replies but this is not my choice ok ok fair point so how bad was it really please let us know but now the <UNK> he does not let anyone know until after the movie end unseen not his girlfriend not is mentor not the police not anyone in <UNK> he comes up with the brilliant plan of f <UNK> <UNK> every girl he knows so he may recognize the <UNK> or something of one of his <UNK> i thought he'd just had enough unpleasant sex during the 12 days of his <UNK> isn't it time to take a little break from all that for me his to put it mildly ill advised actions broke the suspension of disbelief of the movie i took out a book while watching the last half hour out of the corner of my eye
<START> <UNK> the movie is well written well directed and well acted there are many laugh out loud moments and some terrific <UNK> scenes featuring the scenes of west <UNK> <UNK> are filmed beautifully and the script is just downright funny what i like about the movie is that instead of being another sappy love story or another version of jackass it takes a darkly funny look at break ups from a different perspective most break up films feature a naive woman <UNK> by a cheating man she then goes on to find mr right and gets to tell her cheating ex to get lost this movie takes a look at the emotional roller coaster of a <UNK> man without taking itself too seriously ryan <UNK> does an excellent job as the <UNK> man and with <UNK> and brandon as your best friends trying to help you through this rough time how can you take anything too seriously it is obvious that and co are incredibly talented both behind and in front of the camera i look forward to their future films and <UNK>
<START> the adventures of sebastian cole is about a boy named sebastian adrian <UNK> who <UNK> himself becoming a writer at some point given he actually puts effort into it this movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing the adventure years hence the title and the previous quote in it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and <UNK> of loves drugs and sex changes yeah there's a slight twist here that is very interesting and that is that <UNK> step dad clark <UNK> very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex change that has a huge impact on <UNK> family and his relationship with his step dad br br clark <UNK> plays hank <UNK> <UNK> step father and is very good in the part very believable without being over the top which is a route this film could've taken rather easily thankfully they didn't <UNK> <UNK> who i'm only familiar with from <UNK> is also very good in his part as sebastian and together he and <UNK> have a great relationship on screen it's always quite engaging to watch these guys relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times br br and that's the best of what this film has to offer unfortunately it brings with it some mediocre camera work direction and cinematography it's not bad but it's a far cry from being good or memorable in the slightest the characters are also <UNK> written and it's clear from the get go how most of the <UNK> will pan out the only truly fascinating character through and through is clark hank <UNK> i've already said <UNK> did well acting wise but the character of sebastian is not only not engaging but is completely unlikeable i don't honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lies and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete <UNK> it'd be different if he was maybe a side character or comic relief but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously come on br br and i don't really hold it against this film but i just want to say pick a different song in all these films hollywood no more where is my mind by the <UNK> we all know it's a good song stop using it in every other film br br i feel like i could just keep <UNK> more and more of this film apart but in all honesty i didn't hate it i just didn't really care for it and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone the adventures of sebastian cole isn't a bad or boring film it's just not a very good or engaging one either it's very uneven and the script could've used quite a bit of work i guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it and it worked if that writer put out pieces of fiction that i wouldn't want to read
<START> first off the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake inside a <UNK> world war 2 plane is a great opening what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel men chasing men cars chasing men <UNK> chasing men <UNK> chasing <UNK> <UNK> chasing <UNK> for the better part of an hour the most boring nonsense with absolutely no <UNK> to the story special mention must be made of the chop shop editing as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment one last thing the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled <UNK>
<START> julie brown hilariously <UNK> <UNK> attempt at a <UNK> with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs that rival <UNK> own cinematography and sets are top notch br br kathy <UNK> and chris elliott offer their own <UNK> of comedy that enhances and <UNK> this film appearances by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as themselves is an added bonus br br it's hard to tell if <UNK> performance is meant to insult or <UNK> <UNK> madonna though i hardly think the material girl would find humor in it br br my favorite line why don't you come here to the <UNK> all they eat is dog and i'm a <UNK>
<START> miyazaki's studio <UNK> shows his wonderful touch <UNK> <UNK> life in every little action of the characters in when puts down so carefully his little boat to reach for the red fish you know that you'll have a very good time watching this movie br br the characters are interesting and you really care for them they recall visually other stories seems a grown up <UNK> with a son an old lady in wheelchair remembers the witch in <UNK> moving castle br br the presence of the elements wind rain and the sea with its great powerful waves is so strong that i think it has never been <UNK> in such a way in any other movie it is a simple story loosely inspired by the little mermaid and it reach for the very heart of the audience just like <UNK> the other miyazaki's true masterpiece br br an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits don't miss it
<START> this film has no plot no good acting to be honest it has nothing the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you i wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous ice t isn't even a good <UNK> and even worse at acting every bit of the film is rubbish i got this film on dvd without knowing what it was for the price of <UNK> 99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain i then looked at the imdb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the dvd i had bought was a complete waste of time money and electricity if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it
<START> this comes close to the worst movie i've ever seen the writer starts you out in a way that you'll side with <UNK> josh <UNK> when he did absolutely nothing wrong sam <UNK> leaves him for <UNK> chris <UNK> in a way that leaves you mad at sam you aren't let in on what she feels so her feelings with <UNK> aren't real to you and their relationship is phony it drags you in either direction and it gets rather <UNK> and annoying the only good thing about this movie that i saw was the cast br br
<START> this certainly is one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium it's an homage to all the stars of the great tv western classics and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie the story of two brothers who meet after the war between the states and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless and the <UNK> and the atmosphere are great there is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood and lee <UNK> doesn't take part in the action until the very end that's why i gave it 9 out of 10 points but it still is one of the best new western productions i've ever seen i've had the honor and pleasure to meet chris <UNK> at the festival of the west and have a nice chat with him and i've had the chance to meet buck taylor who performs the role of town doctor in my opinion we ought to be much <UNK> to chris <UNK> for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic tv westerns and <UNK> around him to perform in a new western such as this chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters too both are young and promising and i think we should see more of them in future western productions i sincerely enjoyed this western movie it was worth every minute i hope that chris <UNK> will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one great work chris <UNK> p morgan pete
<START> i'm a large <UNK> <UNK> male ex <UNK> ex <UNK> player and ex boxer and i love this movie br br it's no <UNK> river it's a piece of fluff but there is room in life for fluff and when that fluff is <UNK> shot well acted by attractive likable people cleverly plotted and full of good dialogue there's even more room for it br br i'm not the biggest tom <UNK> fan but he's good in this so are <UNK> nicholson love her bald head and <UNK> ellen <UNK> kate <UNK> and even tom everett scott that thing you do br br the scenery is nice the mood is upbeat there's <UNK> and <UNK> and farce and even a little redemption br br any male reviewer who <UNK> this movie is shall we say not perfectly confident in his <UNK> in the meantime i'll continue to catch bits and pieces of it without <UNK> whenever it shows up on cable
<START> this film was utter tripe possible that it is in fact a <UNK> the subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen sarah michelle <UNK> is given nothing to do even in her death sequence but still she is the best performance in this film and the her death is the best thing about it even though she did deserve a better death its the sign of very bad writing and directing i'm guessing she did this film to end her connection with it as its turning rubbish br br not scary not tense not funny makes no sense at all and as said above sarah michelle <UNK> gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast
<START> if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your <UNK> daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so <UNK> with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then i'd say you had a horror movie but some how <UNK> little <UNK> just wasn't scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i didn't want to see them come to harm i wanted the <UNK> <UNK> to get his just <UNK> the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book even down to the torch <UNK> running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here <UNK> voices closing in on you br br i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before
<START> rating 8 out of 10 directed by alfred hitchcock br br <UNK> star guy haines <UNK> granger meets the mysterious bruno anthony robert walker on a train soon afterwards guy finds himself drawn into the psychotic realm of <UNK> world br br guy is separated from his wife and is now involved with a <UNK> daughter guy is interested in entering into politics after he <UNK> from <UNK> bruno wants to kill his own father but doesn't want to do it himself br br bruno <UNK> that he <UNK> with guy's wife while guy's part of the deal is to eliminate <UNK> father guy <UNK> this idea since he isn't interested in having his <UNK> wife killed br br bruno goes ahead with his half of the <UNK> while guy becomes the prime suspect of his wife's murder as law <UNK> continues to investigate guy bruno continues to torment guy wanting him to complete the other half of the <UNK> br br on a <UNK> has one of the most exciting endings of all hitchcock movies
<START> br br after the wit and <UNK> of highway <UNK> and <UNK> i expected this movie to shine but it was as <UNK> and self <UNK> as the hard rock stars it <UNK> the pace dragged not helped by an over long <UNK> sequence the characters were flat and <UNK> and art is no <UNK> i had to poke myself to stay awake
<START> i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called released in 2004 br br the original had a tight story and no <UNK> as described above about the indian <UNK> not having proper records or even bad shoots and <UNK> br br the story is great and a <UNK> one and well described by others but sadly taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than <UNK> br br i guess he has been affected by so called inspired syndrome br br he must at least give credit where it is due br br i liked some of his older movies but now i suspect if any of them were originals after all br br here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece http www imdb com title comment i recommend everyone to see the original even with subtitles if needed to know what class direction and class acting is all about
<START> i'm not really sure where to begin from start to finish bad <UNK> bad like stepping into a <UNK> a john on a 100 degree day if you force yourself to watch this as i did keep some <UNK> handy for the pain i will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor the movie is a cross between <UNK> rides <UNK> meets the terminator meets <UNK> <UNK> playing <UNK> and indians without the <UNK> i've seen better animation in the original cut of the blob you will get more entertainment from watching gone with the wind while suffering from the <UNK> and <UNK> bad acting and hokey lines will have you <UNK> and wishing you had rented <UNK> big top or watched every episode of <UNK> island back to back ugh i'm going to go <UNK> my <UNK> now
<START> for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family all of us hated it with a passion it's a nice enough kids' movie maybe in the year it came out however think about it an outdated kids' movie what's the point kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all br br some kids' movies like mary <UNK> or wizard of oz can be enjoyed even now but time <UNK> is totally outdated for your reference and i think <UNK> in this case i also did not like dr <UNK> or spinal tap at all so if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies you might like time <UNK> br br there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the <UNK> <UNK> think of the two stupid <UNK> in the pirates of the c movies except in time <UNK> they are not even remotely funny br br anyway i warned you that's all i can do people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago if you have not seen it before then don't bother watching it now
<START> chuck <UNK> able <UNK> is the cartoon that introduced <UNK> le <UNK> to the sort of there are a few key differences between the <UNK> we know and love or hate in the case of some people and the character in this cartoon for one the disguised cat who <UNK> <UNK> in able <UNK> is distinctly male also <UNK> is exposed as a fraud whose real name is henry at the <UNK> climax his french accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up <UNK> is not even the lead character here the focus the put upon cat who <UNK> himself as a <UNK> to scare off his enemies for the most part the storyline largely follows the usual format of a <UNK> le <UNK> cartoon but <UNK> aggressive <UNK> is lacking the usual <UNK> and straight to camera <UNK> that make him such a great character he is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather <UNK> animated in fact able <UNK> is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the <UNK> for every <UNK> le <UNK> cartoon that followed this subsequent development has robbed able <UNK> of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull <UNK> le <UNK> short with a weird surprise ending as a child i hated <UNK> le <UNK> as an adult able to appreciate his more sophisticated verbal and <UNK> humour i love the character and most of his cartoons able <UNK> makes me feel like a child again
<START> my wife and i <UNK> all the positive comments below made by other imdb members while this is no box office smash hit it has a special charm all of its own genuine and heart warming br br we saw this on video at the end of a long day we were very tired and in bed normally in a situation like this my wife drops off to sleep within minutes that is unless it is an exceptional movie and this one kept us both entertained right to the very end br br perhaps younger viewers in their teens and <UNK> would not like this but for the rest of us it is a true gem see it
<START> really this movie should be released to dvd i just got a <UNK> copy of what i think was a studio film and i was utterly pleased it was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast three of my people michael york olivia <UNK> both having been in romeo juliet and also john sorry about the bad spelling were in there so on that alone i thought that for the small amount i was spending it would be fine boy was i right i'm not going to give any of this one away you may already know the story anyway but i'll just say if you can get yourself a copy in any format do it you won't be sorry
<START> i saw this piece of pseudo intellectual crap a couple of years ago and it is now making a comeback at the local film club it uses every cliché in the intellectual movie makers <UNK> <UNK> edition in order to appear as intellectual as the director probably <UNK> himself to be you get your run of the mill slow motion <UNK> brown color scale slow pans through bombed out <UNK> blank suffering facial expressions over symbolic imagery and the requisite miserable ending br br it is a complete failure an unintentional perfect caricature of the typical russian art movie the director <UNK> <UNK> has excellent command of technique but he lacks eye he doesn't see when he crosses the line into the realm of the pathetic br br this movie is a wet dream for art film <UNK> it lives up to every stereotypical view of the genre that there is br br if it was bad in an entertaining way it would a turkey but for a movie that is so bad that you walk out afterwards <UNK> p ed off we need a new term this movie is a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the acting of sidney <UNK> and the brooding on screen presence of john <UNK> the edge of the city is a highly watchable film from the fifties directed by martin <UNK> there is great acting and stunning on location photography in black and white br br <UNK> is a delight at this point in his career and tommy tyler the character he plays is happy and <UNK> he befriends <UNK> played by <UNK> who is a young man suffering from poor self <UNK> and a past that he wants kept under <UNK> tyler a black man brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend br br tyler and are employed on the new york <UNK> at a time when the workers were expected to <UNK> the line if they knew what was good for them the boss charles <UNK> played by jack warden in one of his many hard bitten roles becomes the focus of <UNK> which leads to a climactic showdown with br br at the end of the movie we are left with mixed emotions however the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world
<START> i thought this movie was amazing i was a bit skeptical since i really had no idea what it was about but it was beautiful story i cried a lot and i also laughed out loud br br i think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the holocaust and how it affects people it only happened 60 years ago i have been to germany and eastern europe and i have studied the holocaust so this film meant a lot to me i think this film did an amazing job capturing this story i wont go into detail i do not want to spoil it but i definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that i know this may sound <UNK> but will change your mindset on things
<START> driving lessons from the writer of the <UNK> acclaimed films mrs brown and charlotte gray jeremy <UNK> brings a touching heartfelt <UNK> starring academy award <UNK> julie <UNK> and laura <UNK> and from the harry potter series rupert the beautiful portrait tells the story of ben marshall rupert a <UNK> year old boy being held captive in the heart of his <UNK> neurotic mother laura laura <UNK> after his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever free spirited and heavy on the bottle retired actress <UNK> julie <UNK> the pair <UNK> upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life challenging the <UNK> mother as well as each other along the way the two develop a beautiful bond that both their lives br br the comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the british veteran julie <UNK> <UNK> uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream directing comes naturally to <UNK> as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the <UNK> and <UNK> the viewer down into an <UNK> of <UNK> and creation even the subtle score by unknown <UNK> clive <UNK> and john <UNK> the tone and manner <UNK> had no trouble in <UNK> br br laura <UNK> is always making her mark in films as she does as laura the <UNK> and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with <UNK> at the <UNK> of it we are <UNK> into that persona the complexity of her character couldn't have been more <UNK> portrayed by anyone else rupert breaks away from ron and tries on someone new his performance is more <UNK> than <UNK> but gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it but the standout is coming from oscar nominated actress julie <UNK> who gives a life of her own despite the role being clearly a leading one <UNK> <UNK> better in the supporting category where i believe she can simply take home the prize is a mix of <UNK> and mrs laura henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona hopefully her role will not go <UNK> this awards season br br driving lessons isn't an out of this world experience but a fine enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life love and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and <UNK> br br grade
<START> water shows the plight of indian <UNK> in the late 1930s says in the end that the problem still exists largely by giving <UNK> in the end refers to gandhi several times in the movie before finally having a scene depicting him and does nothing extra <UNK> innovative or new in the movie yes the cinematography is pretty impressive but that cannot be the soul of any movie for me br br india has had several problems like many other nations but it has got rid of many of these problems at large what if a movie is made on racism in america in a particular year which ends with <UNK> number of americans still experience racism <UNK> br br a how would it be relevant and b how would it be some thing so extra ordinary being depicted in cinema br br a view i read from a <UNK> <UNK> interview was that this movie is being interpreted as a voice for the <UNK> every where from reviews i read every where the common thing i am hearing is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world the movie is more about a specific problem a society faced and has got rid of through <UNK> at large br br i do not see any thing earth shattering about the movie moreover the movie lacked soul and <UNK> between the plots of and the young <UNK> <UNK> actress portrayed the role of superbly and that was the only thing which impressed me about the movie sadly
<START> man i can't believe the largely harsh and negative comments for this movie okay it sure ain't no sophisticated work of cinematic art but it is a good deal of <UNK> tacky fun for starters the titular <UNK> headed supernatural killer dude has to be one of the single most laughably silly and <UNK> things to ever stumble in front of a camera he looks like something you would see in a fourth rate carnival <UNK> secondly the <UNK> gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing with the definite highlight occurring when this annoying uptight ultra conservative woman gets <UNK> by a <UNK> then there's the always welcome presence of the ever lovely <UNK> <UNK> who's <UNK> introduced taking a nice long utterly gratuitous shower that goes on for two minutes amazingly we also have appearances by deceased schlock picture legends john carradine as an evil <UNK> and cameron mitchell as a horror tv show host moreover scream queens <UNK> stevens and dawn <UNK> have fleeting cameos lead child actor ryan projects all the charm and acting ability of a <UNK> old tree <UNK> pretty brunette rachel carter pops her top and <UNK> her cute little breasts the <UNK> special effects are decidedly less than special the score is suitably overwrought yet this film overall has a certain <UNK> hokey appeal to it which in turn makes this honey a real <UNK> cheesy hoot to watch
<START> one of the worst movies ever made let's start with the superficial <UNK> phoenix is first of all too fat to be a rookie <UNK> the <UNK> does not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> boys john travolta has a bad <UNK> job and the strange <UNK> in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended <UNK> <UNK> the plot hits on all the <UNK> and clichés of what the average joe believes life as a <UNK> is really like they all get drunk get into fights have a hard time expressing their emotions their wives all stay at home crying they all have father issues everyone has a boston accent et <UNK> an <UNK> piece of that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of <UNK> after 9 11 which was by the way valid cultural hero worship this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship
<START> this movie was incredible i did not know the back story on it so i needed to let it unfold before me on dvd it had many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting the acting by <UNK> cassidy was in a word brilliant as well as sally <UNK> the storyline is rich with plausible <UNK> as well as fresh ideas from the present br br there is truly something about ms <UNK> eyes that leaves a mark this movie is a refreshing look on the way in which we look at the <UNK> and how we view that society a very worthwhile watch
<START> hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid you've seen better at your local high school the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b movies the scene with the <UNK> tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes i've ever seen it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie the script was probably a great 10 page outline but when it comes out to a full length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the <UNK> had me laughing out loud but i don't think that was the intent yes there is a little style and hopper can always draw my interest however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this
<START> <UNK> 101 is such a stupid show i don't know if that's because the <UNK> jamie <UNK> spears is the <UNK> star of it or what but i just know that the show sucks it's about a girl and her brother who go to a <UNK> school the jokes in this show are extremely dull and unfunny and i hate every single character except chase and lola heck the jokes on this show are so unfunny that they make jack black look like monty python this show is without a doubt one of the worst shows on <UNK> it's right down there with <UNK> and danny phantom in the pit of shame and if this show was a person with any honor it would hang itself in shame br br 1 10
<START> like for most women this movie is the ultimate chick flick with it's hot chemistry sexy dance and songs i mean timeless classic like i've had the time of my life the wonderful she's like the wind makes this movie i adore patrick <UNK> in this movie and he shows he can sing and dance it's so hot he sings she's like the wind in the movie the chemistry between <UNK> and co star jennifer grey is amazing i love all the dancing and everything that goes with it but saying this dirty dancing 2 <UNK> nights is also great but patrick <UNK> scenes makes this i love the songs dancing and everything about it but it isn't dirty dancing like i said it's an amazing chick flick please let there be a 3rd because i love to see what happens with <UNK> character johnny jennifer character could have been more sexy but hey patrick makes up for that if you know what i mean great movie and i'm so pleased billy zane didn't win the movie role i heard <UNK> he was meant for the role but they found out he couldn't dance
<START> jamie foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind emotionally troubled african american genius of pop jazz mr ray charles though the entire cast performs wonderfully mr foxx earned more than simply an oscar if it were possible to <UNK> an actor in <UNK> years i would consider doing so for mr foxx foxx doesn't just play charles he re creates him <UNK> sanders and sharon warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of <UNK> mother the inspiration of his life and young ray these two provided the strongest support in the film br br the dramas of <UNK> struggles with guilt the death of his younger brother and mother <UNK> <UNK> addiction and success are neatly woven into the <UNK> of his music the music is beautiful the script is as far as i can tell perfect and the acting is nothing short of legendary br br the directorial method of the film <UNK> discussion taylor a director i am generally <UNK> about had to choose what aspects of the larger than life and complex life story of mr charles would tell his story most honestly dramatically and understandably though some disagree seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a <UNK> biopic i believe he selected his themes admirably a big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few <UNK> themes in <UNK> life his profound love and respect for his mother his need to be loved and accepted his addiction and guilt complex his musical genius and his deep <UNK> fear of responsibility for others charles is depicted as a man struggling <UNK> against an army of personal demons i learned more than i could have imagined about one of the men i used to listen to on my old <UNK> with my dad in his on sunday nights while football games were on the tv and nothing was sugar <UNK> in ray the themes are carried forward with power and human dignity these themes create a <UNK> drama which span the length of his long and <UNK> life the power of these themes the strong script and directing the music and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and <UNK> <UNK> films i have seen br br recommended for everyone
<START> this movie was one if not the best movie i've seen in the past year i highly recommend it it starts off as a very funny movie but as the film turns into so much more do yourself a favor and see this film i saw a <UNK> of this movie but i am going to buy it not only for myself but for several true film fans i have the unfortunate feeling this great film will be widely <UNK> as is the case with so many other non commercial films this is a comedic yet heart wrenching movie it will make you laugh it will make you cry it will make you think and yes you will think about it when its over and isn't that what a good movie is
<START> this is like something i have never seen before it had me cracking up the whole time i don't think there was one scene that i didn't laugh through it is about a girl from the country in south who goes off to a big town for college at the school she befriends the <UNK> across the hall when she realizes that he has no family to go to for <UNK> she invites him to come home with her and her family and her serious boyfriend all go out to dinner one night and realizes what her boyfriend is about to do <UNK> she <UNK> to do something so he stands up and shouts something like sorry mate but you are too late i already asked to marry me a couple of weeks ago back at the school and she said yes that all turns into chaos please watch this classic it is totally worth it i swear
<START> firstly this has nothing to do with the much better 18 weapons of kung fu starring gordon liu i mention this as my kung fu theater presents dvd has a totally misleading picture on the cover the wrong plot on the back and goes on to mention no idea why the young hero starring <UNK> <UNK> lee apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 weapons style told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious <UNK> that everyone is after the weapons never really appear again and the fights are all boxing style the hero is lee <UNK> who i have never heard of before or any of the other actors the film mentions another director wu <UNK> <UNK> as well as the one imdb lists the other actors are wang fu wang wing san <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wang <UNK> san king <UNK> and <UNK> who seem to have sunk without trace after this film the fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the <UNK> doesn't have much charisma the twist at the end is just stupid and the film seems to end abruptly as though they got bored with it the scenery and the training sequences in the river are a little different from usual unfortunately the pretty sister gets drowned not the very irritating though <UNK> young boy
<START> love and human remains is one of those obviously scripted obviously acted obviously staged flicks which is so obvious that the escape <UNK> from its <UNK> and <UNK> is beyond me not worth explaining this amateurish flick tries to <UNK> every clever line every <UNK> <UNK> every peculiar sexual <UNK> into one film with an absence of concern for making the pieces fit in short <UNK> crap without the sensation which pretty much just leaves crap
<START> how do you know if a movie is good or not it is the impact it has on you that makes the difference dead man walking upset me a great deal i watched it twice i don't know if i will be strong enough to watch it again no i did not feel good at all after watching it but the film was as successful as it can be br br robbins did a great job in <UNK> all aspects of this controversial topic he avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or <UNK> i hope that many people get to see dead man walking i believe that anyone who supports or <UNK> the death penalty so <UNK> should see the movie br br i don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this <UNK> from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore br br the movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty it describes reality the reality is the best argument against the death penalty br br a 10 10 for great performances good filmmaking and for the most important film made in years br br thank you tim robbins br br
<START> i saw this movie yesterday night and it was one of the best made for tv films i've seen it was very well directed and the acting was superb very convincing the music was good and the cinematography was beautifully shot take out the <UNK> out of <UNK> for a dream and you get wasted an excellent depiction of the world of drug addiction and its consequences given in a very open way in <UNK> anyone can relate to <UNK> to mtv for giving us a good flick for a change from like <UNK>
<START> hoot is the best movie go and see it if you haven't about these 3 kids that stand up to the right and the wrong a perfect family film the characters <UNK> fingers cody <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and roy <UNK> logan <UNK> are the three main characters great movie the best i love this movie and you guys should too its a great movie i mean it a great movie go and see it if you haven't i like it because they stand up to the right and wrong and it has cut <UNK> and the hot cody br br cody is so hot i love him so much
<START> very suspenseful surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students themselves and then being to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond joel <UNK> directs with some skill creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which <UNK> us all when we go thanks to screenwriter peter who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many holes as well particularly in the logic department and believability factors notwithstanding all of that is a good effective film because of the script the direction which again is very surreal at times and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together this core of actors acts and <UNK> off each other very nicely <UNK> sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again he also manages to portray a man a young man with a <UNK> destructive secret from his past kevin bacon is fine as the most <UNK> and skeptical of the group oliver <UNK> is really good as the voice of reason and human fears <UNK> has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well yes julia roberts is here too and very good the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends i was <UNK> impressed with much of but more than anything else the story affected me the most the scene with that dog <UNK> around the street just one of those powerful images <UNK> as were many of the flashback scenes
<START> ok what to say about <UNK> br br there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle <UNK> to awesome there are bad movies that just suck in their own right there are good movies and so so movies and movies that are just fun then there's <UNK> you can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too those movies are so bad they circle <UNK> to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober circles <UNK> from bad to awesome but then it doesn't stop there it takes another trip to then <UNK> again to awesome then finally it sets up a little <UNK> kingdom on the border of bad and stock footage of paint <UNK> while a <UNK> screams <UNK> if you are into self punishment this movie is for you it actually will cause your brain to hurt
<START> i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now but having just sat through the film i felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children please don't this is no disney film this film tells us <UNK> is <UNK> and if you show it to your children in my opinion you are too br br the video box describes the film as a for all and the imdb plot outline describes it as a <UNK> <UNK> i just had to find a definition of <UNK> <UNK> and came across the following usually <UNK> of comedies or adventures these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds all <UNK> to <UNK> and appeal to the imagination whatever the situation there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way not an apt description of <UNK> the <UNK> which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes totally <UNK> for young children and an ending that qualifies the film as a <UNK> <UNK> movie the lesson learned as i said life is cruel family entertainment i don't think so unless you hate your family that is br br another review more revealing than this but worth reading can be found by following the <UNK> link
<START> oh boy it was just a dream what a great idea mr lynch is very lucky most people try to tell classical stories this way he can play with his little and his even more little <UNK> check out <UNK> the <UNK> for far more intelligent mix of fantasy and reality
<START> if you can get past the slow start and bad acting it's worth watching the story line was pretty decent the father had a wicked temper because he was unemployed and he hardly got to see his kid except in the summer because his ex wife had custody of him the father was very angry and frustrated the majority of the time the monster in the story wasn't too scary the movie breaks <UNK> of the monster being so incredibly strong the one scene that the <UNK> do this in is one of the times when the kid is down in the <UNK> and the monster goes to attack him when the monster goes to attack the kid his arm gets caught in a steel trap attached to a chain the monster is about a foot away from the kid's face every other time throughout the movie the monster is strong enough to break through or tear down anything yet the steel trap and chain holds him back from getting the kid more than likely the <UNK> did this for shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die <UNK> just wanted to scare us into thinking it may be a possibility that the kid could die instead of breaking <UNK> the <UNK> should have replaced the kid with someone who they could <UNK> of
<START> <UNK> by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his <UNK> user friendly movie making techniques tim burton <UNK> the <UNK> too far in favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend sleepy hollow following the quest of <UNK>  played by johnny <UNK> delivering this dreary film's only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the story plays out as if it were <UNK> trying to be <UNK> predictable contrived as a children's <UNK> story <UNK> character introduction is laced with intended upon exciting non engaging chase scenes which with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas br br toss in an endless <UNK> of old trees for <UNK> and a wide eyed big <UNK> blonde love interest christina and burton has himself a movie that takes the age old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or dialog was choppy and ridiculous severed heads were <UNK> and there were enough plot revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond even with the backing of <UNK> the most sought after cinematographer in hollywood today the wonderful acting of <UNK> and <UNK> astounding name recognition sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over
<START> the scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end <UNK> to a sequel 'the <UNK> is really a disappointing action movie a team of cave and <UNK> <UNK> go to romania one of these <UNK> places to make a movie for now at least and following a destroyed church enter in a cave that proves to be a realm of underground monsters or are they the movie never decides if it wants to be action science fiction or horror it is a mix of all without salt or fun and acted in a wooden manner the best thing about the movie is the cinematography but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting waste of time
<START> normally i try to avoid <UNK> films but this one was <UNK> awesome kudos to the graphics and character voice overs it all <UNK> well this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others but is well worth buying i don't have kids but the kids i <UNK> including boys find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd i honestly don't know why this is rated so low but for kids especially your <UNK> <UNK> 8 year old will love this its not straight forward and <UNK> like most movies are this <UNK> film has excellent morals and shows <UNK> it has no swearing bits of romance if your old enough to figure it out and beautifully written storyline thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten
<START> nothing special to see here the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era this film has an original story but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters so in my opinion it's not worth seeing i'm not saying that the movie was bad it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times so if you are looking for something original see another thing
<START> please do not waste your time and money with this stinker of a turkey br br this is an over the top melodramatic love story set against the background of new france aka <UNK> in the 18th century or is it an historical saga of new france with an epic romance thrown in i don't know and at this point i don't care anymore br br there is a rich story to be told out there about the <UNK> french <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> characters who settled canada and parts of the us this is not it the characters are total clichés the story is overblown breathless and devoid of any charm and before long all the viewer wants to do is get the heck out of the theatre have his or her head checked and get hold of his or her anger at being taken in by the hype br br this film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of cinema especially since as an <UNK> and a french canadian or canadian of french descent or whatever i am a a believer in the fact that the story of my people in this country has yet to be told as well as it could on film b interested in this subject c a film lover who thinks cinema these days could do wonders with this <UNK> and tragic story br br as i said do not waste your time with this frustrating bit of <UNK>
<START> i honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated claude <UNK> could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock and while this film is only the second one of his that i've seen the first being le i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films the film is a french and canadian co production and takes place in canada the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances <UNK> well with the rest of the film most of which is high quality also the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station after being <UNK> by inspector it emerges that the young girl patricia and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee however as the investigation goes on patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer br br the performances in this film are excellent donald sutherland is subdued as usual but he suits the role he's given here very well and i wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald <UNK> and david <UNK> who both give good turns <UNK> in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films the unknown <UNK> also gives a great performance in her role as patricia the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked when inspector discovers <UNK> diary the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end overall blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen le is a better known effort from <UNK> but for my money this is at least as good highly recommended viewing
<START> frankly i did not think there was anything humorous about this movie it was really lame and poorly done with no plot whatsoever surprisingly it got some chuckles from me at the beginning with the malcolm x <UNK> and that was about it seriously soul plane made even the worst movies such as <UNK> look like a emmy winner this movie is really not worth seeing unless of course you were blind like johnny <UNK> who played the blind man in the movie another sad character i <UNK> at majority of the <UNK> jokes and ruining tom arnold and d l by casting them in this movie this movie could be <UNK> in just one sentence wins 100 000 000 and creates his own <UNK> sex drugs homosexuality more sex drugs did i mention sex if i could i would rate this movie in the negative however the beginning was amusing which brings this movie to a 1 10 doing the t bag <UNK>
<START> this is a fine under rated film and rip torn well known as he is is a seriously under rated actor i read howard frank novel many years ago how well craven captures the book and the beauty of <UNK> <UNK> kingdom i had the good fortune to grow up in <UNK> in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the incident took place i've not seen stranger in the kingdom the craven collaboration based on the incident and another novel but this film has inspired me to track it down
<START> well some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and <UNK> clad <UNK> vampire assassin kicking some ass if that's what you want and you wear a cloak file your teeth to points and think that the name <UNK> silver is cool you'll see a fine film br br if like most people an assassin dressed in <UNK> <UNK> rubber with huge <UNK> thick makeup and bad <UNK> makes you laugh then this is one of the best comedies you'll see i laughed so hard i nearly cried ridiculous acting dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula dead and loving it could be br br it tries to be cool and <UNK> and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious even the tacked on lesbian scene is funny how did she get those boots off that quickly they were laced up to here br br don't see it if you like good films see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over it isn't good it's just bad
<START> this documentary is not only one of the best documentaries i've seen but also one of the most moving and quietly beautiful movies i've seen period it follows the lives of two young men peter and as they try to make their way into the american culture peter and are friends at first but they gradually drift more and more apart as peter goes to kansas city and stays in <UNK> a land called <UNK> beauty is in his eyes he takes people onto his back he supports an apartment full of other paying the rent doing everything for other people he is a quiet <UNK> peter looks out for himself getting a high school education while playing basketball and making christian friends it seems that director <UNK> did not know what she was getting herself into with the beauty of this tale peter and are amazing characters that move you but the real strength in this movie lies in its commentary on american society it is not judging it shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world and how difficult it can be to outside people i suggest you find this film and look at america through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people br br my grade 10 10
<START> seriously if this had been the first shack movie it would have been passable as funny silly and goofy light satire commentary on the class system would make this an enjoyable late night rental br br however everyone wants to compare it to the first film and maybe that's not fair the first film is a cult classic what could possibly follow it up nothing so take this second film as a stand alone and it certainly has its moments br br jackie mason is amusing doing his best rodney wannabe <UNK> is he as good as rodney no are his lines as good no but he is funny the rest of the cast falls in line as being decent but not outstanding you'll recognize faces amongst the cast and wonder how they got to where they are today br br the film is predictable but aren't most in this genre again it's not the best comedy you'll see but if you like <UNK> run type fun you'll enjoy this one
<START> this movie is a hard to find gem it is the story of juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a <UNK> company and the president of same he takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to <UNK> his company away from him all hit at the same time he is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers juliette as the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do <UNK> things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless boss the complications are wild she is not so ordinary as she seems with five children from five different ex husbands who are all still <UNK> in love with her and he is not so <UNK> as he thinks he is this movie doesn't follow a predictable path and that's what keeps you watching the acting is superb and there are some very moving moments along the way as well the working class displays more <UNK> than those above them almost in the same way <UNK> park showed the upper <UNK> is not all it's <UNK> up to be mentally i recommend this movie very much see it 9 10
<START> if there's one cartoon that helped to put <UNK> on the map more than any other it's <UNK> this tale of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has kept its charm for the last <UNK> years besides the effects loved the music the abstract animation and backgrounds the narration by marvin miller pretty much everything and it won the oscar for best animated short of 1950 glad to have seen it on youtube after reading about this dr seuss story for so many years and rocky and <UNK> creator bill scott also contributed how awesome hope to see the subsequent shorts made in the series if not on youtube then maybe in a dvd collection now i guess i'll watch another <UNK> short there
<START> i saw this years ago and it's entertaining but not profound the basic story is of a young man who dreams of though he's not sure where it is or even if it really exists br br spoilers follow he finally visits it gets transformed to a creature by being bitten by another one then he has to help the other members of the because they're being attacked by <UNK> save for the accents they all act like good ol' boys not much in tune with the canadian psyche eh someone observed for monsters or substitute jews and for the <UNK> humans substitute nazis and you're supposed to get an insight into the struggle by the monsters versus the humans well maybe br br one major <UNK> i had was that while the underground city was interesting it was rather <UNK> and frankly dirty this must be a convention for movies with underground <UNK> one would think that if the monsters were the good guys some would have at least a little sense of <UNK> br br the storyline is a tad thin but that's to introduce characters but it's entertaining enough for a repeat view
<START> i'm not a big fan of movie musicals annie was a stage show i loved but the movie was a flop the phantom of the opera movies and i believe there were three failed to match the <UNK> staging but i loved this the dvd will take a place of honour among my <UNK> even though it's a movie adaptation it somehow captures the <UNK> and the atmosphere of live theatre bette midler always a treat is just exceptional in this role there's great music lots of laughs and even a tear or two i've seen most of the big musicals of the eighties and nineties somehow i missed this one so there's no comparison to make but if it gets <UNK> i shall be first in line for tickets but this movie is so good i'll be in the odd position of wondering if the stage production will measure up to the movie
<START> i am trying to find somewhere to purchase a dvd vhs copy of the movie isn't it shocking i was 7 years old when i saw this movie and i lived in the town where it was filmed a couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friend's homes were used in a couple of the scenes the filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community i have only seen the film once originally and i would like to get a copy so now i can show my family the film i have done extensive <UNK> online with not luck and i was wondering if anyone would have any ideas on trying to get a copy of this movie
<START> the core meets crack in the world 1965 made for tv the acting is stock the suspense predictable once you <UNK> all of the plot ripped off from the core basically the <UNK> <UNK> machine you end up with the plot of crack in the world crack was a truly excellent movie starring dana andrews his team of scientists working in south africa <UNK> down to the <UNK> and <UNK> through with a nuclear device in order to provide a steady source of energy one of his <UNK> also a brilliant scientist <UNK> he believes that the blast will not <UNK> a simple hole but will instead form cracks in the <UNK> possible spoiler he is right in order to stop the <UNK> crack from destroying the earth they must place another nuclear device in the path of the crack br br although i have placed a spoiler warning i don't know if i really spoiled anything for either movie and since crack in the world is only available in very rare vhs format if at all my decision not to reveal whether or not the counter blast works is probably academic br br all in all i rate <UNK> just below average
<START> alright this movie might have been good if there was a plot behind it the title didn't even fit the it after the first ten minutes the wind didn't have a whole lot to do with the rest of the movie the acting was sub par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories br br as far as horror movies go this shouldn't even be classified as one this was a disgrace to horror and thriller fans everywhere i hate to be so harsh but i felt i want the time i spent watching this movie back hopefully there will not be a follow up to this this movie should be locked in a vault and never released to the public for viewing
<START> it took a <UNK> out film to columbia for gene kelly's home studio mgm to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films cover girl also became rita <UNK> signature film for the <UNK> and their <UNK> fantasies during world war ii br br kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in brooklyn where rita is a featured dancer and phil <UNK> the comic of course kelly does a bit of <UNK> himself there br br hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire otto <UNK> when it turns out that <UNK> had loved and lost <UNK> grandmother in some flashback sequences from the <UNK> era hayworth also plays her own grandmother with jess barker playing the young <UNK> you might remember jess barker was the husband of that other legendary screen <UNK> susan <UNK> br br broadway producer lee <UNK> also is attracted to <UNK> but he's not interested in nostalgia he wants her for his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and in fact the biggest number of cover girl is the title song of the film it's nicely done in <UNK> style br br hayworth also gets to sing a sure thing in a <UNK> era number and in the only song in the show not written by <UNK> <UNK> and ira gershwin hayworth also does an old english music hall number poor john when i say sing as everyone knows rita mouths words singing here is done by <UNK> <UNK> br br the biggest hit of the show is long ago and far away which is introduced by gene kelly it was one of the biggest hits of the world war ii era and one of the biggest sellers <UNK> <UNK> ever wrote it happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this september long ago and far away was nominated for best song but lost to swinging on a star br br what really sets cover girl apart and what makes it a <UNK> film for gene kelly is the two numbers put me to the test and the alter ego number harry <UNK> decided to do what louis b <UNK> had refused at mgm to give kelly creative control of his own material kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career in it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate br br in fact after one more <UNK> out film christmas holiday at universal louis b <UNK> never <UNK> out gene kelly for the rest of the time he was at mgm and he did get creative control from then on br br with that dazzling technicolor cinematography and <UNK> red hair and gene kelly's <UNK> creativity cover girl was and is a classic and will forever be so
<START> was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this there was a hole in the plot so big nothing could have filled it up from the first scene when the co star is late for dinner was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done the suspense was over from there now it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours wondering how dumb the screenwriter the director slater molly parker and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer who was not a lawyer or a policeman could go into a locked cell at a jail kill his second victim and tie him up from a <UNK> to make it look like suicide i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened if someone can explain it to me please do and then why for god's sake did he kill the third victim nothing made sense and yet someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh
<START> this junk bore as much resemblance to the novel as a <UNK> slice does to a <UNK> the film makers took the <UNK> section out of the book made it into a movie and said it was based on the book <UNK> wonder what they did to <UNK> mr <UNK> to <UNK> this piece of fluff it was just another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rifle santa <UNK> 13 days of glory collection of <UNK> i almost started rooting for the <UNK> just to get the damn thing to end and what was that scene where <UNK> <UNK> was trying to get james <UNK> to let him look at the knife the sexual <UNK> he used were juvenile and unnecessary they could have used the film they wasted on that silliness to put in some real dialogue this show was an embarrassment to hollywood or can those <UNK> be embarrassed
<START> like most people out there who have watched james bond <UNK> movies most people never knew that <UNK> was originally the first <UNK> movie to be released but after ian <UNK> wrote the story with kevin and jack the 2 other authors took ian <UNK> to court and won the case providing evidence that ian <UNK> took the ideas of <UNK> special executive in terrorism revenge <UNK> so rather than making <UNK> they <UNK> <UNK> went on to make dr no br br this movie had the best of the best from getting sean connery to come back one more time he was paid over 5 000 000 for <UNK> <UNK> and sean connery had problems on the set that much is true but overall this movie was up there i think with <UNK> <UNK> to kill dr no those are my favorite from the bond series david <UNK> was hired for special <UNK> effects he was working at the time on <UNK> before never say never again the 100 million dollar <UNK> makes the disco look like a <UNK> this movie starred the best <UNK> in a bond movie just behind dr no <UNK> maria held together this neurotic business like calm manner with a little wit to his authority over bond barbara <UNK> was excellent as <UNK> br br the music was better than every score that didnt contain john barry doing the score music in most bond films michel <UNK> is not big in the usa compared to over in europe he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years its a little bland at times but the <UNK> theme that happens around 3 or 4 times in the movie never say never again is so cool i like it more than the original br br <UNK> is back one more time br br timothy dalton explained it right i thought you cant relate to a superman or a superhero he or she has to be human and have feelings he was by far the best serious true to version of bond but sean connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others to follow i bet at 75 now he could still pull off a <UNK> role in a <UNK> movie if one ever <UNK> br br
<START> citizen kane the godfather part ii <UNK> <UNK> this is the single greatest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed upon humanity <UNK> ray moore in a role that <UNK> academy awards stars as <UNK> the <UNK> cat in the universe he clearly does not take any <UNK> from no turkey i myself am unfortunately a turkey and proves it with his powers of <UNK> <UNK> and karate <UNK> this is <UNK> at its absolute finest a shining example of the genre with its low budget continuity errors and hatred for rat soup eating <UNK> <UNK> the true godfather of rap not this new ali nonsense moore is something of a <UNK> of acting technique somehow managing to be the most charismatic awful actor of the 1970's and thats saying something this one is highly recommended folks if not for the one liners alone
<START> i seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it throughout the years i wish i'd waited longer maybe this movie was funny in 1988 i don't know i was younger then but it didn't seem like the world was that different michelle pfeiffer lovely as she is is never convincing <UNK> <UNK> not only <UNK> scenery but <UNK> it in her <UNK> like a to save for later dean <UNK> is about as convincing as a mob boss as james gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the <UNK> and matthew <UNK> demonstrated the most <UNK> case of <UNK> <UNK> i've ever seen all in all it's not bad enough to make you want to <UNK> out your eyes with a <UNK> <UNK> but it's not far off
<START> let me <UNK> from many comments i've read here and say that this film ranks as one of the five best bonds along with on her <UNK> secret service from russia with love <UNK> to kill and for your eyes only the only time roger moore actually played the role of bond instead of around of course sean connery pulls the whole thing together as co writer co producer and in his best performance since from russia with love he is fit energetic and obviously enjoying himself his acting is mature confident and laced with the right amount of humour this is in contrast to his mechanical performance in <UNK> his <UNK> through you only live twice and his <UNK> romp through that cartoon known as <UNK> are forever br br this is an imaginative <UNK> of <UNK> without having the sets and machines overwhelming the characters and plot this cast is far superior as well <UNK> maria <UNK> brings his unique style to the role of <UNK> without relying on an <UNK> <UNK> ring or a boring uniform kim basinger is athletic and lovely barbara <UNK> is dynamic and for once we have a great felix in <UNK> <UNK> the depictions of m and q are original and the addition of the bumbling agent small fawcett is fun without <UNK> into slapstick br br director <UNK> <UNK> makes good use of his locations the <UNK> and the french <UNK> without losing sight of his actors although close <UNK> reveals some mediocre special effects and <UNK> in continuity <UNK> keeps the film moving at a good pace unlike <UNK> which even its director <UNK> young did not like obviously fans will miss the gun barrel trademark and the <UNK> theme music but they are after all owned by <UNK> productions br br michel <UNK> may not have composed the most memorable score but it captures the atmosphere of the locations without being overly <UNK> not surprisingly his best moments are in the south of france with his french love song at the health <UNK> being particularly attractive and tell me how many really remember the music for <UNK> i personally would rather forget man with the golden gun and a view to a kill br br the <UNK> folks can <UNK> at this film if they like yes <UNK> made more money at least <UNK> mature <UNK> didn't swing through the jungle <UNK> a tarzan yell he did not <UNK> with a <UNK> tiger nor did he fight off indian snake <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> despite <UNK> desperate efforts to stop this production kevin and the late jack <UNK> put together a fine film one that i think ian <UNK> would have appreciated br br if however you would rather see james bond get kicked in the <UNK> by a dwarf engage in another tiresome struggle with jaws jump into bed with grace jones or lead a slapstick chase through san francisco this is not the film for you
<START> tim burton the man behind the original batman film and <UNK> brings the world the sequel to batman that <UNK> the original in more ways than one firstly michelle pfeiffer and danny de <UNK> are a great mix of <UNK> enemies the dark deadly and sexy <UNK> works well to <UNK> some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original the sets are stunning and <UNK> <UNK> city has so many dark <UNK> that you could never know what's happening at one time or another the only thing that gives it a bad name is its script which at times seems to <UNK> and then not recover for while tim <UNK> direction bring superhero films into a new realm beats all the superman films and the other batman films by a mile though in terms of <UNK> the new batman begins has a bite where this one lacks but burton is a more original director than nolan
<START> this movie is the very worst that i have ever seen you might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time but if you haven't seen this one you don't know how terrible a movie can be but wait there's worse news the studio will soon this masterpiece i'm being ironic for all to see the only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects the acting the direction and the production bill <UNK> the poor man's ed wood not that there is a rich man's ed wood i like ed <UNK> movies though manages to keep things moving at a <UNK> pace throughout this film it opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot a sorry couldn't help it by a pair of unlikable hunters who are killed by the parent this causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a bigfoot hunting <UNK> this is pretty much it for the plot nothing even remotely interesting happens and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters if one is interested in the films of <UNK> i would recommend almost any other over this however as i said it will soon be <UNK> by troma in order to bore a new generation of <UNK>
<START> this is fantastic everything from the score to when the final credits role this movie is a masterpiece it's genuinely creepy and its effectively hysterical setting is enough to give anyone the creeps it is apparent that the movie was not rushed and that david <UNK> who would later work with <UNK> on the puppet master series had a clear and <UNK> image of what he is trying to direct the professional aspect of the movie is astonishing considering it's relatively low budget it relies on scares without effects mainly due to budget <UNK> but still creates a tension filled atmosphere br br stephen king stated that this was one of his favorite movies and i seriously cannot blame him it's one of my favorite horror movies and always will be this is my favorite <UNK> movie and has been ever since i first purchased a good few years ago br br money well spent i own both vhs and dvd versions br br 10 10
<START> perry mason the case of the fatal fashion finds perry and della street in new york getting an award from the american bar association an <UNK> trial record ought to get some recognition i would think anyway a friend of <UNK> fashion editor diana <UNK> gets herself arrested for the murder of a rival valerie <UNK> and in fact raymond <UNK> and barbara hale witness a confrontation between the two at a posh <UNK> br br these two rivals have a thing going that makes and <UNK> look like school girls of course <UNK> has a number of other people who loved her equally as much br br the same <UNK> also ran down a fashion designer who could have exposed the individual this throws perry with his <UNK> <UNK> lawyer william <UNK> in an alliance with some <UNK> seems that the designer was a cousin of a mob boss who wants also to out some justice in their usual manner br br one thing i could not get is when <UNK> and mobster robert track down the <UNK> i cannot believe that the police were also not <UNK> pursuing the case of course has some access to sources that the cops just don't have br br but the best part of this particular mason entry is scott <UNK> as the young rather full of himself assistant district attorney introducing himself to raymond <UNK> saying how he studied all of his cases and looked forward to beating him foolish boy br br in fact my favorite scene is <UNK> and <UNK> at a <UNK> with the judge <UNK> was wanting to <UNK> his case and add a witness and came ready and prepared with <UNK> <UNK> catches him off guard and says he has no <UNK> to the new witness and then proceeds to <UNK> the witness on cross examination absolutely priceless br br scott <UNK> is the best thing in this particular perry mason movie and it should be seen for him alone if nothing else
<START> this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story <UNK> had real life with a boy like at the football program in my town <UNK> had a mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and i can identify with it 100 a boy like just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is a very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and i loved it and i will always remember this for being a movie that tells a riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man
<START> i'm not sure if these other people saw the movie some apparently couldn't follow the complicated plot he's a <UNK> who owns an oil company who also happens to big game hunt wow that's really far fetched any way his new <UNK> machine happens to break through a <UNK> and on the other side is a world <UNK> from our own time where dinosaurs and <UNK> wander around nothing ground breaking about this but it certainly isn't ludicrous anyway the rest of the movie is about this t rex they find which the <UNK> <UNK> claimed was there hunting them and them hunting it look it's an old made for tv movie of course the special effects look cheesy they didn't have cg they did the best they could and for a they did a hell of a job for the time this movie should be remade for the big screen i'd love it and i'd be the first one in line seeing that dinosaur with modern day special effects stalking those guys would be great
<START> this movie was chosen quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store it turned out to be quite a pig the plot line such as it is was disjointed inconsistent and predictable the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be <UNK> the poorly written lines the only funny moment in the entire film <UNK> around the dangers of smoking and the <UNK> of an <UNK> the remainder of the film lacked the punch to <UNK> either of my young daughters aged less than ten years myself my wife my mother in law or even the cat or the dog my advice if you are tempted to borrow this turkey is to save your money and your time look for something else
<START> i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience you can either say to yourself a let's make a movie that kids today will love or b let's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience prime examples are e t the <UNK> or indiana jones that darn cat is an example of the first approach you see these flat unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short but instead it goes on and on and although i'm not a kid i don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids the clumsy cops chased by a dog the old lady with a <UNK> bird or christina <UNK> sarcastic <UNK> one actor showed a spark of talent with his very <UNK> humour doug e doug playing the fbi agent
<START> it isn't too bad but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has br br the jokes are few and far between the actors are attractive they shouldn't be the film makers think far too much about the cinematography it's supposed to look like a home video and it's just like a serious version of and kim it's stupid br br it's too normal to be and kim and kim are supposed to be two <UNK> middle aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes there are no look at me <UNK> jokes the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she's not even slightly stupid she's a stereotypical black latino chick br br it's just not as stupid or funny as the australian series it doesn't compare nothing is the same i admit this show is pretty funny at times but it is not anything like the aussie series i was looking forward to an american take on a family they failed it's supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors don't act stupid to me this is just a typical american tv show it's a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show br br 2 stars because it is an okay show just nothing like what it should be
<START> i <UNK> quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my least favorite <UNK> gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome <UNK> but it has the best acting i've seen in a lewis film however we all know that's not saying much once the movie was done i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie though it was only <UNK> minutes long i'm trying to see all of films and that's probably the only reason to see this one br br the gore is good as usual the one thing that <UNK> seemed to get right the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception that exception is frank now would i say that he's a good actor no way but he's good compared to everyone else the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end i didn't care what happened just so long as it ended i know this is a cult classic but i didn't enjoy it very much at all i hope you will
<START> nothing is worse than the of our world's history this film attempts to describe the horror faced by one particular family a common narrative device in the atomic bomb world of <UNK> the most memorable parts are the graphic and <UNK> images that the people of <UNK> face in the aftermath of war the story however becomes more concerned with the effect on a specific group of people and how they cope with getting on with their lives in other words if you don't really care about them the film grows boring it's hard not to care though when a family's <UNK> is <UNK> i'm not sure if i would recommend this film because it says very little politically and honestly did not keep my interest in the family's troubles
<START> cinema at its best is entertainment if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for <UNK> and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions often biased then one should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment when i spotted an airplane flying <UNK> in a film dated i was amused the background scenery in casablanca is <UNK> fake so do i set up a <UNK> say that the film failed to convince <UNK> relax and enjoy some excellent acting decision to cast the protagonists as french polish was inspired one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing no need to <UNK> on the authenticity of the <UNK> this is powerful cinema if there is a political message which is still relevant today have a dinner party a <UNK> with the <UNK> a with the some polish <UNK> and perhaps a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> and discuss the political aspects of until you drop with <UNK> would surely have agreed
<START> george c scott gives his finest and funniest with wonderful drama as well in this <UNK> screenplay diana <UNK> is attractive and quite the complicated young woman this film <UNK> between tragedy and chaos in a new york hospital of the late 60's with <UNK> consequences <UNK> hughes is delightful as always great stage actor as well br br an 8 out of 10 best performance george c scott was a big blow hard when he put down vanessa redgrave at the 1978 oscar ceremony but he's a good writer a truly ensemble cast that works wonders down to the smallest role this won best script at oscars and scott was nominated he should have won for this instead of <UNK> the year before which he was also brilliant in seek this out
<START> jim <UNK> always seemed to put out wonderful television shows this was sadly one of the <UNK> lived it was endearing to hear each tale with their delightful morals each episode was a new story with new characters john hurt did a wonderful job playing the <UNK> and the sarcastic tone of brian <UNK> as the dog was always enjoyable br br the set designs and costumes were very well done the muppet work when required is classic jim <UNK> work you know it is a muppet but it's endearing appearance more than <UNK> you find yourself enchanted and compelled when each episode comes to an end you realize that you were quite entertained an entertained that is fulfilling not the kind that wears off after a few moments you sit back and think about each episode realizing that each story is indeed timeless and presents a strong tale of morality br br i have yet to show this to my own children but this is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment i <UNK> you to find it on dvd and snatch it up if you can't do that then just find it some how
<START> it has been recorded that john ford made the big blockbuster movies so that he could afford to make the small movies that he loved so well <UNK> master with a young ben johnson is clearly one of his best if not the best of his small movies the location shooting the <UNK> the intricate work with horses and the inclusion of the <UNK> indian are all trade marks of ford as in many of his other films <UNK> the great russian director's influence is seen in this film the supporting cast including ward bond russell simpson and jane <UNK> are excellent as well as the many minor character actors ford used including his brother the one who plays the drums while ben johnson went on to win a well deserved supporting oscar for the last picture show his co star harry carey jr did not reach those heights although his father carey sr became a western leading man in ford's early films carey jr spent most of his career in supporting roles for fans of john ford and for fans of western films this one is a must
<START> keys to the <UNK> an original series by the canadian comedy network <UNK> scored big with this entertaining yet inspirational <UNK> this show is <UNK> by four funny good looking guys who judge others on their ability to pick up women each episode features two guys who go head to head in various pick up games there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a <UNK> in an <UNK> toronto night club br br being a guy i naturally find this show hilarious we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few <UNK> if you pay attention
<START> eric roberts stars in this tommy lee thomas debut prison film he plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards though evil by most people's standards his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting <UNK> while you hang <UNK> to the ceiling as he <UNK> you with lethal weapon electric <UNK> br br the movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense thomas has clint eastwood's eyes dolph <UNK> one liners the acting abilities of and the body of the <UNK> guy you knew in school who took <UNK> after <UNK> br br martin <UNK> <UNK> career shares this low point with roberts in the film it is difficult to tell if character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if <UNK> just came that way i couldn't blame him if he did br br fortunately for all involved this movie has a so bad that it's good quality that can be fun if you have absolutely nothing better to do
<START> there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little that's good br br the plot has enough holes to sink the titanic the characters are completely unbelievable the monsters are so unrealistic and i'm sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an ex husband and ex wife being thrown together in some bizarre <UNK> it happens far too often in films and it's become another bad cliché br br i find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested 1 in making this garbage never mind the 100 or so it must have cost br br you could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer i didn't think movies could get this bad avoid it at all costs do something that's more fun and enjoyable such as having a tooth pulled or an <UNK>
<START> i am really surprised that this film only has a rating of 6 4 as of the time i did this review while not exactly a great film i do think it's one of the best films <UNK> did and it's a shame it isn't more highly regarded i think a lot of the reason i liked the film so much is that the usual silly <UNK> persona as the <UNK> <UNK> isn't present and her role required her to actually act i just hate seeing film after film after film in the early days of her career where she seemed more like a caricature or cliché than a real woman i don't necessarily blame <UNK> for the silly <UNK> films she made in the 1930s audiences loved them and they did make her famous but here she showed she really could act after all just looking at her in films like <UNK> blonde <UNK> and the blue angel who would have guessed that she was well cast to play a gypsy i was quite prepared to hate the film because of this casting decision but it worked she was pretty believable and a lot of fun to watch as well the film is essentially a vehicle just for ray <UNK> and marlene <UNK> the other supporting characters are very much secondary to the movie <UNK> is a wanted spy in pre wwii germany and in his efforts to escape he stumbles upon a rather <UNK> lone gypsy <UNK> who instantly takes him to be a <UNK> of prophecy in other words her new lover <UNK> is quite <UNK> but reluctantly agrees to travel in her <UNK> even putting on body paint and <UNK> his ears to make him look like a gypsy hence the title to the movie over time he slowly starts to realize that underneath her very <UNK> exterior is quite a woman and romance slowly <UNK> br br the film in a word is charming a nice romance with a good dose of comedy and fun just the sort of picture you wish hollywood still made also please note the performance of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> he was very <UNK> in the short time he was on film and i just loved his deep and beautiful voice br br finally a sad note to consider while the film is set in germany no mention is made of the upcoming gypsy holocaust during the war throughout german territory the nazis <UNK> a huge <UNK> of <UNK> and so the final nice ending to the film is a tad far fetched
<START> this wonderful film has never failed to move me the colour convincing cast and stunning scenery all make big <UNK> this production unlike the later remake by <UNK> is more <UNK> and presented more from the children's own perspective it on certain episodes from e charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary <UNK> and all style that <UNK> <UNK> above all the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas <UNK> the story throughout adding extra emotional depth the net result is a truly <UNK> combination of <UNK> experiences that <UNK> present the poignant story of the <UNK> children br br one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to <UNK> throughout this film is how things have changed since those times and in many ways for the worse yes maybe many of us no longer have to use outside <UNK> and travel in horse drawn <UNK> but what about the quality of life in general consider the foul mouthed celebrities who now grace our tv screens their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable consider too the fragile here today gone tomorrow aspects of so many of today's plus all the single mothers whatever happened to that institution called marriage when people accepted each <UNK> flaws but still remained together loving their children these details add extra when watching this marvellous film br br i hope that as generations pass children will still be able to enjoy this film not to mention certain adults
<START> i enjoy b movies i think bruce campbell is a very watchable actor i love how he delivers his lines <UNK> dead 2 and of were great movies i liked <UNK> however i don't know if i'll ever watch this movie again and i bought it now after saying that i bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching this movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy even as a <UNK> movie first off ted <UNK> was annoying just flat out annoying there was nothing to his badly acted written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before the directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots <UNK> i don't expect woody allen or james cameron here but campbell did not deliver br br i did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an oscar movie like <UNK> but still i'm disappointed i would have been happy with or 'the <UNK> <UNK> i got much less by the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me no dialogue that <UNK> within me even <UNK> had a classic line for sake i do not recommend this movie
<START> this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10 my advice is don't watch it this doesn't even <UNK> as a movie br br you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny they are actually very lame and stupid very foolish choice by <UNK> <UNK> and tara reid to act in this movie might even upset their careers a little br br when i walked into blockbuster the main focus was on this movie so i decided rent it i sincerely regret it br br once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen i was hoping it would get better but instead it got worse br br i am not <UNK> this the movie is terrible don't watch it hope this helps
<START> i've avoided seeing this film for some time but finally picked up a copy having been born too late to see <UNK> in its contemporary setting i have just been familiar with the uk and broadway cast <UNK> for many years and saw it on stage in the late 1980s where it looked a little <UNK> but still great fun br br the film it drops some of the songs the bed my conviction frank mills and cuts others walking in space however what is left is presented very well indeed all the singers and dancers are excellent and the key performers especially treat williams as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as sheila john savage as claude are memorable br br as a <UNK> celebration and <UNK> <UNK> manages to be remain potent even in a film made ten years too late it was no longer the era of peace love and but the time of punk rock although watching this film now in the time of <UNK> problems gives a new <UNK> to the vietnam issues of the 1960s br br <UNK> <UNK> who also made <UNK> did a good job on directing in its scope and feel it reminds me of norman <UNK> christ especially with the joy of the scene and the <UNK> of to be <UNK> br br i really enjoyed this film and consider it a good representation of a musical born out of the first truly <UNK> era
<START> i have loved the book a little princess for most of my life and was very excited that there was a movie but i was appalled at this adaptation not only is the acting wooden and the plot a convoluted <UNK> mash of various incidents in the book but the theme is all wrong the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 <UNK> to a <UNK> child even when she herself is very hungry the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> actions considerably and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story br br there are many other things wrong with this movie too many to list but here are just a few of the larger ones this story should be set in <UNK> in the mid <UNK> not america during the first world war miss is harsh to sara from the start making her actions when sara is left <UNK> much less startling than they would be if she was <UNK> sweet at the beginning as she is supposed to be nowhere is it mentioned that <UNK> is black <UNK> father does not come back he is dead it is his closest friend and <UNK> in the diamond mines who finds sara and <UNK> her to her proper place in fact the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all though they are the source of <UNK> wealth br br all through everything that sara has faced she always acts like a princess giving what she can and <UNK> those who hurt her she would never have called a <UNK> two faced bully such a thing is completely out of character for her and <UNK> the entire philosophy that she is to be well <UNK> no matter what br br this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen with the notable exceptions of ella enchanted and anne of green <UNK> the continuing story the plot of the book is wonderful and <UNK> written so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version which is far superior or better still read the book it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie
<START> as i recall my family made a point to stay home on the night <UNK> was on <UNK> <UNK> nbc it was a superb vehicle for james garner very well written great ensemble cast his character very much like the support your local films retired <UNK> with mysterious past <UNK> into town and has adventures every week in fact it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character it was just a <UNK> of a tv show a sleeper like my world and welcome to it which may have been its contemporary i forget i <UNK> wish these shows would be made available on dvd it was just good tv perhaps county jr come close but only by a mile
<START> with <UNK> squad receiving an average of 4 7 on imdb com no wonder steve this website so but the fact is that <UNK> squad is a poorly crafted black comedy both words in <UNK> marks for a reason it's a movie full of over acting <UNK> <UNK> mother coupled with a couple of <UNK> performances beth and <UNK> boyfriend a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a <UNK> red <UNK> and never be noticed a movie chock full of not so <UNK> <UNK> and nudity shots that make you wonder does the director think this is funny or clever most of all the characters are so paper thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable but probably not on purpose <UNK> squad can't decide whether to be a comedy or a drama or a satire patriotic music i get it the movie fails at being serious because the idea of killing for any school position this being prom queen crosses the line into insanity not to mention shots of flag burning and drive by shootings a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy and fails at being a comedy for all the forced and <UNK> placed jokes big butt mama funky black principal and excessive <UNK> delivered poorly by the principal cast watching the documentary making movies anywhere only made this film more cringe worthy with praise <UNK> towards it by the director and the director's father <UNK> not a black comedy or anything for that matter i guess kansas will have to wait
<START> spoiler alert don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers br br i think this film had a lot beneath its shell besides the apparent connections with <UNK> and park other films an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the <UNK> physical action br br the main actor <UNK> ho song is terrific in the of the priest sang <UNK> sang means blood in some languages who truly loved <UNK> <UNK> played by ok bin kim their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy <UNK> in <UNK> where the girl appears <UNK> and the man is basically wrapped around her finger br br their relationship is one thing but the girl's mother is entirely different while moving she is stiff one dimensional and taut but <UNK> she says all through not moving or through the <UNK> of an eye br br park <UNK> has really really <UNK> his cinematography in this film and owes a lot to stanley kubrick there are a whole lot of beautiful shots <UNK> throughout the film some for simple effects and some that require several <UNK> and probably repeated views to fully catch br br the music is quite stock using mostly strings to <UNK> the main it's a very good thing that the character is as <UNK> as he is while he does very little and loses at that he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot while his love interest says and does a lot her actions display very little thought behind it in my humble opinion br br all in all a very disturbing film that is not made for action which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days it's magnificent and <UNK> at the same time
<START> think of it as an extreme form of <UNK> without trial without commenting and taking a side on the us foreign policy the process of extraordinary rendition involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country an opposite to an if you wish to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to <UNK> information instead of <UNK> your <UNK> with blood of potentially innocent parties you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted <UNK> techniques br br naturally given the <UNK> of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance or get nothing or worst of all get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say it's an ugly process and what better way to do it when you're the champion human rights giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives in an age where information is key to the battle against terror and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionable br br rendition is this year's <UNK> though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller <UNK> to take that crown with rendition first of all followed by the robert redford movie lions for <UNK> starring tom cruise and meryl streep again though now on the other side of the fence and the kingdom with jamie foxx and jennifer garner though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven directed by <UNK> hood who did and will be <UNK> the new <UNK> spin off rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days the split which provides for some ample <UNK> perspectives to be presented through an ensemble cast br br <UNK> el omar a chemical engineer gets en route to going home under the orders of cia top <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> meryl streep at a <UNK> facility outside the us jake <UNK> cia <UNK> douglas freeman oh so <UNK> <UNK> on his very first <UNK> session no doubt being thrust into a position that he didn't sign up for back home a very pregnant reese <UNK> <UNK> for answers to her husband's disappearance and sought after an ex flame alan smith's peter <UNK> assistance since he's working for senator <UNK> alan arkin throw in j k a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between and you have quite a bit going on in a busy picture br br given a number of casts locations <UNK> and the likes rendition wasn't confusing at all and it plays out with <UNK> handling of the material never quick to judge presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the <UNK> every character has their own agenda and the <UNK> of this agenda <UNK> enough not to bore nor to confuse you and the best part of it all is how very truly they bow down to self <UNK> in different forms and ultimately in various lose lose situations unfortunately it kept you guessing as well did he or didn't he and constantly played with your mind as to whether <UNK> deserved what he's getting it <UNK> one extremely smart of hand which i didn't see coming until it's too late so there goes the credit though it did <UNK> to the usual stereotyping of terrorist <UNK> and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations br br perhaps it didn't find a need to given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue paradise now day night day night <UNK> even while it turned out to be rather one dimensional personal tragedy to <UNK> of bombs to become a suicide <UNK> i felt rendition did right in not providing any <UNK> sweet ending that this fight against negative destructive ideology isn't something that can be addressed in a two hour movie and i'm glad it <UNK> clear such fairy tale <UNK> br br what we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of rendition and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on on which camp you belong to do you support <UNK> severe pain in <UNK> yes or no this is the quintessential question of our time yes or no ok i'm already <UNK> for lions for <UNK>
<START> tim robbins makes a wonderful film his wife susan sarandon gives a wonderful performance as the sister helen who wants to help sean penn who is of murder and who also will die of an <UNK> <UNK> minutes of acting and touching scenes is what you get great acting and it is a film that gives something to think about br br susan sarandon deserves the oscar of 1995 best actress it is probably one of her greatest films ever br br i didn't see 'the will rock but i sure have to see more films of robbins br br rating 9 10 or 1 2 out of 4 go and see
<START> that pretty much sums it up corny <UNK> inability to act is at times painful and hurt must need money to take such muted roles but i still enjoyed it br br why in a single word travolta he is great in this movie still i can't give the movie too high a score but it certainly deserves better than it seems to be getting
<START> spoiler or two not that is matters br br two things stand out about this movie first is it's been titled both bruno and the dress code and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that br br second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall the adventures of a grade school cross <UNK> isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in shirley <UNK> manages to walk around the issues of gender by <UNK> <UNK> desire to wear a dress to religion which probably opens up an even can of worms what was she thinking br br yes there's some humor and it's not directly offensive but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal <UNK> that different people should be accepted or maybe <UNK> no matter what br br which is fine but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress he wants to show up looking like a <UNK> <UNK> knight on awards night and his final costume makes him resemble a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doll yet all the other kids dress and behave well like regular kids so what gives if it came down to it we all could <UNK> ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like and the result would be total chaos br br this accepting of people who are different is also pretty <UNK> defined i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear <UNK> hunt <UNK> and go to <UNK> pulls and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is bruno is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time
<START> one comment said it wasn't a comedy mistake it was a delightful comedy of a period of history that doesn't lend itself easily to that genre very busy and active film from beginning to end often the shots out the window of the train or car were just beautiful an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours in a theater all the french historical figures like charles de and and the some of the people involved in the french resistance were included in the script which might send those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of france under the german invasion might want to research the characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent recommend it 9 out of 10
<START> low budget junk about <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> headed by peter cushing its up to priest donald <UNK> to stop them crown international released this crap in 1978 and it was dog of the week on one of the episodes of sneak previews with gene <UNK> and roger ebert i forget which of the two <UNK> it but i see the point crappy movie has the worst peter cushing and donald <UNK> performances i've ever seen there is a monster on the video box no such beast exists in the movie instead you get a statue but at least its correct woo <UNK> br br the <UNK> look like the <UNK> <UNK> if a group could exist skip it
<START> i hope from his seat on <UNK> comedic throne spike <UNK> can see and can enjoy this film as <UNK> ryan and ken have taken a book that the author himself said writing it nearly turned me mad into a joy to watch br br the film tells the story of the irish town of and the problems <UNK> upon it when the <UNK> between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up cutting its way through the centre of the village and more <UNK> through the middle of the this causes some deceased buried in the catholic to now be in the <UNK> north and so the local priest <UNK> by a wide variety of eccentric locals aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness and so avoiding the <UNK> british border guards br br it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of <UNK> he brings an innocence to the part especially in his to camera pieces which is normally where he <UNK> with the <UNK> of richard attenborough playing supposedly the writer director of the film playing father is also worthy of considerable praise and the rest of the cast from the household names like elliott <UNK> and rhys jones to people with what would normally be called such as <UNK> daughter jane who plays wife give 100 the credit for this goes in no small part to the wonderful <UNK> given by spike in the original book br br i could argue that the film is slightly too long or that elliott <UNK> irish accent left a little to be desired but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film
<START> even with only 6 000 bucks and a cast of part time actors christopher nolan was a master nolan is in my opinion the next great and our first taste of nolan doesn't <UNK> that br br none of the problems that constantly <UNK> and <UNK> the low budget independent picture haunt nolan and crew our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story in all honesty i think following is <UNK> best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over it's a beautifully imagined film it takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget the dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent br br <UNK> trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you with <UNK> and the <UNK> you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film we can <UNK> time by the appearance of our protagonist this method of telling a story is both creative and engaging i am glad that nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method the pay offs in the <UNK> and <UNK> would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format this idea has been done with <UNK> success before but nolan has truly made it his own br br the script here is <UNK> finest i had some doubts about his writing abilities i all ways imagined that his brother <UNK> was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with following it is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function <UNK> about <UNK> and how it can lead you to discover what makes people <UNK> actually sounds plausible br br my only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting br br following is the first film of the man who will <UNK> 21st century film making at it's finest
<START> this movie starts out the way every movie should start out with a bunch of hot babes in a <UNK> walking around in their <UNK> and or topless a couple of them take <UNK> i'm liking it so far unfortunately we then meet or main characters they're just not particularly likable usually in these movies the actresses aren't really acting they give very natural performances and they're quite sympathetic fun and likable not here they don't have much of any personality and i didn't care for them much br br some of the girls go on a camping trip for school on the way they stop at a backwoods gas station and meet a biker gang the biker gang should really have been left out of the movie it was cheesy before but now it's just plain stupid the head biker looks like a middle aged guy dressed up as john bon <UNK> for halloween the girls go out to the woods and later the biker gang follows them br br i don't really know what the heck happens after that there's a bunch of stuff about the world ending because it's the end of the millennium then some of the <UNK> get killed by a mysterious indian dude who keeps disappearing somebody gets eaten by a cheesy lock <UNK> monster thing as he's swimming across a lake some guy in silly makeup is apparently a <UNK> and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls in order to <UNK> the end of the world or maybe cause the end of the world i'm afraid i wasn't paying much attention first he dresses the girls up in animal skin <UNK> br br it could have been a really fun cheesy movie but the biker gang kind of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so <UNK> that it didn't even live up to my grade z schlock expectations they really should have eliminated half the plot elements and just focused on one or two things instead it's all over the place overall if you're looking for late <UNK> schlock i imagine you could do worse if you tried really hard there's plenty of nudity at the beginning but the characters are kind of crummy and the plot is too nonsensical to be even the least bit satisfying
<START> this film is great with some of the best songs <UNK> by bon <UNK> and kiss the film is about a man named chris mark <UNK> who is the biggest fan of a band named steel dragon and then when he gets the gig for lead singer his world changes upside down with great acting by jennifer aniston this film is a must see for rock lovers br br 4 5 stars
<START> when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for <UNK> the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to <UNK> if only it were possible the other films being <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> both which are better than this crap in the hat br br i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this <UNK> on the good seuss name br br to mike myers i say stick with austin or even <UNK> <UNK> world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all <UNK> br br
<START> before barton jumps all over my remarks let's all just keep in mind that opinions are like <UNK> we all have them br br i loved <UNK> weaver jeff daniels i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime <UNK> just perfectly and understated unlike some others i did not find this all predictable br br i found role <UNK> humorous and realistic especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer br br i found it enjoyable and wasn't <UNK> <UNK> this to all and <UNK> this is why there are different <UNK> of ice cream something to please everyone
<START> unfortunately this movie is absolutely terrible it's not even laughably bad just plain bad the actors do their best with what is the <UNK> script ever how scary can a movie be when the climax actually involves a <UNK> of millions of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the film begins with ingrid bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in new orleans from paris apparently years earlier her mother was involved in a scandal and ingrid returned in an effort to <UNK> <UNK> who would have sooner forgotten she or her mother existed that's because she reasons if they are shocked enough they'll pay her off to get rid of her then with this money she will leave new orleans and seek out a millionaire somewhere else as she poses as a <UNK> along the way gary cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest br br it's amazing that this film wasn't the reason that ingrid <UNK> film career <UNK> her performance and character were that bad instead of the classy and <UNK> female she usually played in films she is probably one of the most annoying characters in film her fake <UNK> was shallow demanding unpredictable and <UNK> dumb how she was able to <UNK> any man seemed a mystery as she seemed less <UNK> than just plain nuts i am not <UNK> to say that she <UNK> at times like someone with a combination of a severe mental illness and a personality disorder and all these together make me think who in the world would fall in love with this mess frankly i couldn't stand watching her <UNK> and <UNK> behavior and she looked more like a guest on the jerry springer show than a leading lady confusing awful and <UNK> are words that come to mind when i think about her role br br the rest of the cast is frankly overwhelmed by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> while gary cooper is generally an excellent leading man he is dominated by her and just looks lost and oddly they cast two total <UNK> as her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jerry austin ms <UNK> is best known for her portrayals of queen elizabeth i but here for some odd reason they <UNK> her in makeup and the end result looked much like the love child of a <UNK> store indian and aunt <UNK> her face was very wooden she <UNK> odd <UNK> and she dressed like a slave as for mr austin he was a dwarf and while this shouldn't be held against him his role was written like he was a court <UNK> a very very <UNK> role for someone who is <UNK> challenged overall the rotten acting writing and limp direction make this one of the big <UNK> of the age nearly as pointless and dull as such famous <UNK> as <UNK> and swing your lady
<START> i loved all the other don <UNK> movies but i never heard much about how to frame a <UNK> and now i know why i can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds but even most of them would give this a thumbs down at best there are brief moments of mild amusement mostly from don <UNK> playing the same nervous underdog persona that made him famous br br after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw we were in complete <UNK> the <UNK> gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don <UNK> character br br be happy that mr <UNK> reluctant astronaut gun and mr chicken movies are around to enjoy
<START> i am a huge fan of the original assault on <UNK> 13 the ice cream scene <UNK> me to this day i'm 33 now and i still remember being horrified by it as a child when i heard they were <UNK> it i thought it might be good but when i saw the film it's 100 not the same film it's not a remake it's a bad stolen idea it was completely ruined the cast maria <UNK> laurence fishburne ethan hawke gabriel john <UNK> and <UNK> de <UNK> are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film it was just wrong even the setting was completely opposite and how in the hell did no one in that city notice that there was a war going on next door why didn't help show up sooner stupid no sense
<START> i love this movie at first i didn't expect much of this movie since i didn't hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres i also didn't think david and <UNK> would make a good on screen couple i've expected a lot out of on screen couples since i saw you've got mail and <UNK> in seattle with tom hanks and meg ryan personally i think <UNK> richardson should've played part and vice versa i don't know i just think <UNK> should've stayed in the movie longer with david they seemed perfect for each other but it just figures that in a movie the girl next door always gets the guy like in while you were sleeping i was very wrong though this movie was fantastic everything was done brilliantly bonnie hunt did a great job of directing the lines were perfect with the wise cracks everywhere br br warning spoilers ahead br br i love how everything <UNK> with each other for example in the beginning elizabeth and bob were talking about going to italy and in the end bob meets grace in italy sydney the ape doing the hand thing with grace like he had done with elizabeth is an example too br br notice spoilers end now br br one thing i didn't like about the movie was it was a little well i just don't think a man could get over his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had ever been with his entire life you'd think he'd <UNK> himself from the world for years before even coming out of his house to talk someone instead he goes on a blind date a year later and falls instantly in love with a woman he's never seen in his life but feels a connection with br br over all it was a splendid movie it had me crying two or three times and it had me laughing countless times the scene in the restaurant with <UNK> <UNK> date for <UNK> water was hilarious it is definitely up there with great romantic comedies like you've got mail <UNK> doors and while you were sleeping br br go rent it today
<START> this movie has some good performances as others have pointed out but suffers as others have pointed out except for the people who apparently are either friends of the filmmaker or the cast to otherwise explain why they would <UNK> this a 10 from some self conscious and self absorbed film school padding and excess plots this is the type of plot that sex in the city could handle in a half hour episode so there was no reason for it to be even an <UNK> minute movie a perfect example of wasted footage is the fast <UNK> montage in the first third of the movie some of the back story is <UNK> but too much time for example was spent on daria character with the <UNK> sex boyfriend and on the back story for paulie who was not a realistic character although the actor did a decent job with the lines he was given br br the worst aspect of the movie was the level of amateurish parts from <UNK> in the <UNK> material to bad jumps and edits poor camera positions angles lighting problems throughout and most <UNK> a poorly written script with a badly developed concept if the writer also the director and lead had <UNK> with someone he might not have ended up with a 100 rotten score on rotten tomatoes which further the ability of anyone to truly believe the people who gave it a 10 on the rating system here
<START> this is the first and as far as i can tell the only completed production of heart of darkness ever released prior to starting on citizen kane orson welles shot some test footage for a version of heart of darkness that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called <UNK> where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character charlie <UNK> he would be seen only <UNK> in mirrors windows water etc the film was never made the <UNK> technique was used not too successfully in <UNK> in the lady in the lake with robert <UNK> starring as philip <UNK> presumably the coincidence of the two <UNK> e characters is just that of course francis <UNK> apocalypse now was based on heart of darkness br br the short novel heart of darkness by the polish born british writer joseph conrad first <UNK> in a british literary magazine in <UNK> features one of his favorite alter <UNK> ship captain charlie <UNK> who also <UNK> the short story youth and <UNK> tells the story of lord jim <UNK> <UNK> out of work decides to take a job a river boat for a <UNK> company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of king leopold <UNK> personal the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> free state <UNK> travels from london to <UNK> signs on with the company and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the <UNK> river to a far <UNK> station headed by one of the <UNK> most <UNK> agents in the colony a german named <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> for the production of rubber and other products from station have <UNK> and no word has come <UNK> from <UNK> for some time there are rumors that he has gone native <UNK> is to investigate take any necessary action and make a report on his return he takes passage down the west african coast to the mouth of the <UNK> is <UNK> for weeks while he is forced to <UNK> his boat at the company station on the coast and finally sets out <UNK> to find station the river the heat the <UNK> the <UNK> the insects the people all take their <UNK> on his <UNK> his imagination and his mental resources he finds <UNK> ill half mad and close to death the final encounter and the death of <UNK> are almost an <UNK> especially since conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves this is a novel where you close the book vaguely <UNK> with the ending but nevertheless <UNK> the story for its amazing <UNK> br br this heart of darkness was filmed with <UNK> in central america standing in for west africa it is best where the novel is at its greatest <UNK> actually showing us first world <UNK> what a boat trip up a <UNK> river would look like but the rest of the film was forgettable tim roth does his best as <UNK> but so much about the plot characterizations and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered if the aim was to make <UNK> story for the screen why didn't they leave it alone it's <UNK> to expect that no <UNK> will be made when a book is made into a movie but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and <UNK> most disappointing of all was john <UNK> as <UNK> he was completely miscast and simply <UNK> the role everything about him is wrong his looks his acting style his voice his accent everything a vastly better choice would have been someone like bruno <UNK> unlike <UNK> an actual german like the character br br this is a very disappointing production and i would recommend it only after you've read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the <UNK> river circa <UNK>
<START> the brave one seems to indicate that the main character of course is brave i'd disagree the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her getting brutally beaten along with her fiancée who doesn't live another day from it is to go after the criminals without <UNK> to a total distorted view of society jodie <UNK> character <UNK> is a radio personality who's <UNK> is walking the streets and recording what goes on we're given no real depth aside from <UNK> had someone she loved he died the police don't pursue it she gets a gun <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead <UNK> into the character and so were left with something <UNK> from past movies the vigilante code of justice where taking the power in one's own hands is all there is but we're never too sure if <UNK> is sane or not if the filmmakers take a position one way or another that is until the end which is such a stupid message to take anyway dog included as overbearing metaphor while making the new york city of today which has become significantly <UNK> than say twenty years ago look like you'll get <UNK> or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car br br there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this perhaps just in the <UNK> subplot with <UNK> <UNK> detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn't his and a woman who he's not linked to and a step father who i don't know what aside from <UNK> parking lots and being a bad dude but we're left to a script that's both ham <UNK> and disjointed with logic it becomes laughable for example to see that at first the logical side of <UNK> unable to really shoot properly as seen in her first shooting in a <UNK> store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband and then giving way to the illogical of her crack shot at shooting at a <UNK> driving a car head on at her and killing him and <UNK> just in time to not get run over it doesn't help that style with the camera becomes a little more than <UNK> it's called a <UNK> for a reason not because it can <UNK> in and out br br ironically the script and direction become very good or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge caught between a video taped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film <UNK> in a pace that is perfectly <UNK> and when <UNK> first comes back on the air to her radio show and she <UNK> up trying to do her old <UNK> and speaks out a <UNK> the <UNK> about how afraid she is this scene from <UNK> performance to the clear direction and script is the best scene in the film but aside from that there's just a lot of <UNK> into a psychology that's flimsy is she a de niro in taxi driver or a bronson in death wish we have her narration over scenes some of it doesn't have to do at all with her radio show <UNK> how disgusted she is with walking around at night nothing to do but her self <UNK> task of cleaning up the streets but unlike death wish a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario the path of endless violence just <UNK> to a message one that won't be news to anyone who's seen a second of lifetime movie of the week melodrama br br the actors make do with what's given and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated the hackneyed plot turns and the plain old inexplicable plus the unintentionally hilarious like a few <UNK> <UNK> by howard after getting shot in one scene and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger it's a very <UNK> picture with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear headed convention <UNK>
<START> with looks that could kill and a <UNK> to display her charms <UNK> <UNK> leaves no doubt as to where her <UNK> lay br br she plays a <UNK> innocent 13th century princess who <UNK> her people to save egypt from the ambitions of a powerful michael <UNK> and joins her forces with the son of the of <UNK> jeffrey hunter to save her <UNK> throne she also finds time to fulfill a great deal of exotic dancing her <UNK> legs make her hard to forget br br the emphasis is not on the plot but on the visual pleasure of a great number of beautiful girls in sensual costumes
