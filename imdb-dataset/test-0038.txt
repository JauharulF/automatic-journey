<START> i love this show it is amazing i can never miss an episode even if i've already seen it the actors are perfect for the parts i love <UNK> girls i've gotten all my friends to watch it even their parents watch it now i watch it daily and i usually watch it more than once a day i wish my mom was like my friends say that i talk and act like and <UNK> have a wonderful mother daughter relationship it is a great teen show because they actually kind of learn from watching it my <UNK> has <UNK> from watching <UNK> girls lauren graham and <UNK> <UNK> el are perfect for the parts of and <UNK> i think luke and should get married because chris has left and <UNK> way too many times and has broken heart too many times too
<START> these days <UNK> scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to <UNK> movies especially since he has films like alien gladiator and blade runner to his credit so from this partial list of his credits it's obvious he's an amazing talent however if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness that's because although it has some nice camera work and style the film is hopelessly dull and <UNK> however considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground then i am <UNK> to looking at it <UNK> hence the score of 4 br br by the way this film is part of the cinema 16 european shorts dvd on this dvd are 16 shorts most aren't great though because it contains the man without a head copy shop rabbit and <UNK> it's an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying
<START> i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane austen fan i <UNK> through to the end however this is not a programme i would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as i don't think it does the book justice nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right there was something about this adaptation that lacked believability many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and i found the acting to be at times poor there is no doubt that the actors were all very good looking but this didn't provide enough variety to create really diverse memorable characters it was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out <UNK> return home which is one of the most interesting parts of the story the best actor was blake who captured the <UNK> of edmund very well and the <UNK> were effectively cast too i do like <UNK> <UNK> as an actress but this role did not suit her and was much better played by frances <UNK> in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance jane austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately this is one of the worst i have seen
<START> not as well known as the english american german and french cinema though cinema from sweden from the was also quite good interesting and revolutionary br br this is a movie that is made great by its story the story is told in 'a christmas <UNK> kind of way in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past present and what could have been it's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well the message comes across as very powerful and effective this is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of swedish cinema victor br br the story is based on the novel by other swedish author <UNK> the story is adapted by victor himself who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements to let the story and movie flow better it perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one br br the movie does not only have a great story it also is a good looking one the movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color <UNK> to create the right mood and to indicate what it past present and br br did not only wrote and directed this movie he also plays the main character of course the acting in the movie is over the top at times by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early german movies was the case and after all this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting so it really doesn't matter much or <UNK> br br a really great and effective underrated silent movie classic from sweden br br 9 10
<START> this film is the best kung fu film of all time although there is not wire work and special effects like those used in <UNK> tiger this movie uses <UNK> and creative camera work to create memorable fighting moments and the fight scenes are well choreographed and tight there is a ton of action in this film with lots of great fight scenes but the story is very good too with lots of twists and turns the characters are well rounded and have real depth to them as the motivations for their actions and personality are revealed in a much greater detail than most kung fu films there is some really great camera work in the film with my favorite shot starting as a close up on our hero's face showing his reaction then pulls back quickly to reveal the scene before him that is the cause of his look originally i bought the movie to hoping see some great fight scenes but upon multiple viewings i learned how terrific the acting and story were as well overall a great film
<START> the <UNK> musical hair is my number one cult movie i do not know how many time i have seen this film in the movie theaters and on vhs or how many times i have listened the cd with the stunning soundtrack and now this masterpiece has been finally released on dvd in brazil br br the <UNK> and touching story is still amazing a <UNK> of freedom friendship and liberty of choices and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war i do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the <UNK> of the 70's and their dreams since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's i do not recall who won the oscar in 1979 but treat williams and john savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances beverly <UNK> is extremely gorgeous in the role of a <UNK> spoiled upper class teenager i have seen hair probably more than twelve times and my eyes always get wet while <UNK> walks to the airplane singing that's me that's me that's me and i start crying with his <UNK> in the cemetery i believe this is one of the most beautiful sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history my wife my daughter and my son also love this film therefore i can guarantee that hair is timeless and recommended for any audience my vote is ten br br title brazil hair
<START> i don't know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set as it is in the middle of the war macy has returned from the war his neighbor asks hey is it true you got a fritz over there and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses hence the name and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of <UNK> anti <UNK> and macy and dern could wrapped up in it funny how neither is jewish in this film but the <UNK> is made also it is historically accurate as the labor union <UNK> of this time wrapped themselves in the <UNK> of america and god macy is continually <UNK> to come to the meeting his presence brings unexpected results br br <UNK> this time frame to today is a study in contrast in 2005 has <UNK> a complete <UNK> with average citizens who have taken <UNK> and religion as their supporting the <UNK> party and viewing organized labor as part of left wing america br br a great picture to watch if you care to see the friendly <UNK> and meek macy played beautifully by him get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid 40's in nyc br br a tough emotionally charged film
<START> this film sucks it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random good gore but little plot sally <UNK> and complains about everything till she becomes a demon i figured that she had <UNK> it sure seemed that way the dubbing in this film is horrible one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio i knew at that moment my <UNK> were correct that it was not from the us i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film some good characters but not many not worth wasting one's time
<START> barely came <UNK> the whole movie acting is bad dialogs are even worse felt kinda 4 watching it but it was named the same as one of my favorite games so i <UNK> <UNK> they even screwed up the sound at certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud that i had to turn the volume down it would be great if this was a competition about who can screw up more br br oh and ps i don't know what's this guy uwe capable of creating i certainly don't think this movie is bad just because he's the director i checked the list of his work and this is his first and probably the last creation that i've seen br br over out
<START> since the characters begin with unknown identities they not identified by name so you start with handsome james <UNK> waking up in a warehouse he finds out the place is locked up tight don't ask the windows are made with security glass and it's impossible to get out four other awakening men make it a <UNK> mr <UNK> in his jean jacket barry pepper in a ranger shirt greg kinnear with a broken nose joe <UNK> as a chair bound man and jeremy <UNK> shot and <UNK> man oh <UNK> br br these five men have collective <UNK> they think that three of them are <UNK> and two are victims but they don't know who is which or which is who the is due to a <UNK> <UNK> don't ask it happens meanwhile on the outside lead <UNK> david <UNK> as parker sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's wives bridget <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> waits but criminal gang leader peter <UNK> in boots is also on his way to the scene br br like the dvd synopsis says as secrets are revealed and clues <UNK> the five men must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive this story reads a lot better than it looks on film unfortunately when the secrets are finally revealed and memories become clear there is no longer much interest in what has happened simply director simon brand has a great premise with matthew idea but they light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick br br unknown 11 1 <UNK> simon brand james <UNK> barry pepper greg kinnear david <UNK>
<START> this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect skip it and watch something else br br but if you're looking for camp value this is it here's my advice gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it
<START> the director seems like a good solid man his parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with they <UNK> from each other they loved each other they misunderstood each other and the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and <UNK> of one of the most boring families ever to come out of long island br br there are few interesting choices in this documentary the music is banal the filming uninspired and the story is the same story that has played out on every <UNK> street in every town in america i don't mean to sound too harsh seldom has a <UNK> more well <UNK> documentary been made the director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends you just wish he had <UNK> as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive
<START> i attempted to watch this and was highly disappointed don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala <UNK> brother david amidst this dreck it is the polar opposite but if you're into <UNK> fart and <UNK> jokes you'll be in seventh heaven this is bathroom humor aimed i assume at those who've had several which can only explain why many <UNK> reviewers have <UNK> this crap as the best television writing ever i assume that those who hate such <UNK> humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high end comedy the characters <UNK> the shock factor is set to 10 and the laughs are set to zero unless of course you seek juvenile low brow humor br br i made it through 40 minutes praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment but alas it just got worse and worse and beware of <UNK> ever present and hammy <UNK> expression it will set your eyes rolling it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the <UNK> family br br to those who loved it i'm sorry this is my opinion it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review
<START> i <UNK> despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison it's nothing but a campy frightening and <UNK> shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh so nasty time the 70's a decade im glad i <UNK> a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer br br the animation is <UNK> dated not least of all with it's tacky missing frames and characters with huge <UNK> heads this film is an eye sore from the knowing <UNK> nod to the parents with the gay sea horse and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams <UNK> voice to the overtly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> high this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully <UNK> from the terror it caused me br br this ghastly display of complete <UNK> should carry an r rated <UNK> so disturbing it is in it's <UNK>
<START> my father has worked with top secret information in the <UNK> before and he is the one who mentioned this movie to me when i was a kid i would always ask him what would happen if he gave away secrets and he recommended this movie br br in the movie it really puts 2 almost completely different friends in a <UNK> they never really knew what the outcome would really be the snowman really <UNK> me up because the movie portrayed him as just some drug <UNK> that did not know what he was arguing about and in the movie it seemed like he got the worst of everything the <UNK> chris is just a guy that wanted to express his feelings on u s government in a very radical view br br for movie lovers this is a must see
<START> if this is not heavily featured on every list of what not to watch it should only be because those keeping that particular list are not aware of its existence which as long as that remains so is the acceptable alternative i'm not kidding you this is a bad movie joseph <UNK> returns from the dead with various vague <UNK> supernatural powers the most employed of which would seem to be appearing in new increasingly comical looking and ridiculous and never scary or creepy in general when this goes for the latter of those it winds up just being bizarre and attempts at the former just don't work period outfits and stereotypes <UNK> and he is portrayed by david keith whom i respect in well at least <UNK> doing a more often than not terribly inconsistent which could also have to do with script and often over the top performance a character or two have personalities so unbelievably irritating that they're painful to watch the editing thinks it's considerably more clever than it really is and what on earth was with the red <UNK> for the flashbacks cinematography oh dear framing coverage effective use of angle that one could be attributed some to editing too perhaps please guys stop me when i say something you've ever heard about the existence of as far as the technical side goes this is a pretty lousy excuse for something more worthwhile to put in the <UNK> than film but why stop there the plot is just poor the basic <UNK> been done and it's been done so much better than this the crow would be one the way it's told is <UNK> and while there is some explanation behind the flashbacks it still doesn't satisfy pacing is about non existent the lead is distinctly unlikeable and there's more personality in a <UNK> door not to mention that those are also considerably less wooden kelly and thomas ian nicholas what in the name of all that is good and just pun intended are you doing in this you were already funny before this on the drew carey show nicholas well i haven't seen you in anything <UNK> american pie but if nothing else you were funny later on and in those productions the amusement was intentional dialog is the less said the better language is <UNK> and tends to be stupid the violence is <UNK> done and they don't even seem to care to try to hide it <UNK> at it might have been the smarter <UNK> characters don't get me started why spend so much energy on portraying <UNK> at times utterly illogical events the more you think about this the worse it gets it's not even passable as a bad horror flick or a b movie it may very well pass through the rest of the <UNK> and go further still it couldn't scare you on the scariest day of your life if it had an <UNK> <UNK> machine i recommend this only to people who want to <UNK> how bad this is and don't say i didn't warn ya 1 10
<START> if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or <UNK> from it this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention <UNK> to i wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy it is a low budget movie with amateur actors it looks like it was filmed for a film contest the acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a <UNK> <UNK> script writer my family laughed at it a grade <UNK> all the way you won't be scared by this one here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film when the guy gets his toe <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> stupid portrayal of the <UNK> james <UNK> walking <UNK> the guys reactions are like if he had an <UNK> with no pain killer watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie when you see <UNK> white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a <UNK> buck don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure
<START> i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining the only thing i enjoyed about it was when robin williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill and the end when he seems to get killed glenn close was obnoxious and she obviously did not seem old enough to be mother a mother like would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and families br br robin williams and his <UNK> <UNK> look of <UNK> goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me he has two roles he can play funny person or sad tragic good hearted victim see the fisher king good morning vietnam and all of his so called dramatic roles it is always the same performance put them all together into one long mini series glenn close is always a cold fish remember fatal attraction would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen john <UNK> had the only interesting role this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys so seeing him as a <UNK> was at least funny <UNK> is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick <UNK> dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound
<START> the 2002 version of the time machine is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite <UNK> special effects br br what a lousy uninspired bland story with no imagination why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci fi classic are today's movie audiences too hip for the h g wells writing largely as is the 1960 george pal version told a much more endearing story even with clunky low budget effects beach party looking and that looked like <UNK> on <UNK> br br the 2002 version must have h g wells turning in his grave br br 1 the idea that the time <UNK> is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time <UNK> is an old sci fi cliché this totally <UNK> from the love affair with <UNK> what happened to that made the 1960 version so endearing this sets an unfortunate and <UNK> tone early on that makes the whole movie <UNK> if guy character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time <UNK> dilemma  not have it dawn on him <UNK> 000 <UNK> in the future  from a no less <UNK> what's wrong with time traveling just for fun adventure curiosity as <UNK> in the 1960 version br br 2 only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what <UNK> was doing with the time machine when you first see it the george pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of though a 4th dimension br br 3 the director goes out of his way to make character look geeky a worn out old stereotype of scientists in the 1960 version rod taylor was a little nerdy too at least around but managed to be <UNK> playful and charming br br 4 among the key themes of the 60's version abandoned in the remake is the idea that endless war leads to the <UNK> of humanity blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless and doesn't do much for science <UNK> for over 4 billion years the moon has suffered vastly more powerful <UNK> <UNK> which would make any nuclear device look like a <UNK> yes science fiction needs artistic license but this is just plain dumb and meaningless br br 5 destroying the time machine is stupid too apparently our time <UNK> invented the <UNK> bomb to power this thing blowing up the machine to kill is sort of a cop out ex <UNK> <UNK> never comes back to the <UNK> to tell his tale to his <UNK> friends a key part of the wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back br br 6 having running around in the daytime totally ruins h g <UNK> wonderfully spooky <UNK> portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night a true cinematic opportunity lost also wells depicted the as <UNK> and <UNK> these guys in the movie looked like they could take on if they weren't such big baby <UNK> br br 7 the one smart  kind of a <UNK> out star wars evil emperor had potential but is so lame and <UNK> he tells <UNK> to take his machine and go home boy what a dramatic high point in the book the steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep it br br 8 the goof ball <UNK> at the n y public library is too much it makes light of the idea of human <UNK> the 1960 version simply had the talking rings that delivered a <UNK> somber <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> evolution is serious stuff br br its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived <UNK> of a script save the cost of a ticket popcorn and go rent the dvd when it comes out soon no doubt at least you can fast forward thought the dull parts just like our time <UNK>
<START> e <UNK> <UNK> is a one of a kind surreal depiction of the <UNK> treatment of religion there are a couple of different ways you can interpret things but the plot itself is simple a god himself and out of his corpse springs mother earth mother earth then the god's corpse post <UNK> and then <UNK> herself with what remains of his seed following this she gives birth to a <UNK> figure who <UNK> presumably in <UNK> but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth this all takes place in the first 15 30 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of <UNK> figures dragging the <UNK> who is <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> across a desert landscape the <UNK> figures pause only to the <UNK> then continue to drag him around br br there are a couple of ways to interpret this depending on your level of optimism and your world view it can easily be interpreted as a bleak <UNK> <UNK> allegory about the total lack of apparent power that christian <UNK> can be perceived as having in a modern society that only <UNK> their names to advance its own selfish goals or you can interpret it as a <UNK> pro christian allegory in which you view the film as being about how mankind has twisted <UNK> message around so much that it's original <UNK> and innocence can no longer have relevance in a world where that message and image are <UNK> used to <UNK> everything from <UNK> violence to war to <UNK> br br the visuals of this film are phenomenal and you will not see anything like it period if you can watch the original vhs release i recommend it i'm not sure if the visuals are changed on the dvd but i have seen clips of this <UNK> on you tube and the effects are seriously <UNK> on the vhs version achieved total contrast meaning there basically aren't any mid tones except for some grain in some of the shots other than that this film offers the rare opportunity to see pure white and pure black and the result is stunning <UNK> and quite unsettling this film makes film noir look positively washed out and mediocre the shots fade into each other in a surreal manner that recalls un <UNK> <UNK> without completely <UNK> it for an effect that has been called a <UNK> test br br that being said the film can certainly try a viewer's patience and commitment there isn't any dialogue for starters the only sound throughout the film is a fairly constant loop of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> occasionally with the <UNK> and death <UNK> of the dying <UNK> and an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> personally i find that the film is best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> spiral era more abstract noise experimental music like f <UNK> buttons and odd it also works quite well with apocalyptic black metal basically any music with extreme <UNK> and or hypnotic <UNK> that's one of the most amazing and versatile aspects of this film it is prime for <UNK> re like <UNK> it during a performance of avant garde music or <UNK> avant garde music to <UNK> it br br once the <UNK> figure is born there really isn't much change for the rest of the film meaning that you are basically sitting through at least 45 minutes or more of the <UNK> figure being drug around the desert and beaten it looks <UNK> beautiful but there isn't really anything new unfolding it helps to <UNK> the filmmakers intentions of <UNK> that for thousands of years now people have been using <UNK> name and image for personal benefits but can be tiresome to a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span basically if you are looking for a modern horror film with suspense look elsewhere if you are looking for a unique film experience and you aren't particularly fond of mainstream hollywood cinema this could be your <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i don't know if this type of movie was as cliché then as it seems to be now br br considering how many bad news bears films had already been released by 1980 however i think that this sort of movie was already a tired idea br br a former football player is partially <UNK> in vietnam and is confined to a wheelchair the chicago bears offer him a <UNK> job but he wants to coach at the same time his <UNK> nephew is picked up for armed robbery we are told that he has already been arrested over a dozen times before and he must now serve some hard time which turns out to be less than a year br br of course the kid is actually a good kid who only needs a tough male role model in his life the same goes for all of the kids in the <UNK> facility yes even the one locked up for attempted murder i'm sure you already know what happens so i'll try and keep the rest of this brief br br our protagonist becomes the coach of the kids' football team he <UNK> the cynicism and earns their respect his team faces off against a local high school team yeah right and they get their <UNK> kicked now determined more than ever to prove himself a worthy coach he demands a <UNK> will these <UNK> <UNK> kids with hearts of gold be able to improve enough to win the <UNK> awful execution of the football sequences ruins any possibility of excitement in this film coach of the year should get <UNK> for <UNK> my brain 1 10
<START> too predictable for spoilers but i'll not be <UNK> below so don't read it if you care br br a few dull <UNK> together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so let's start with a criminal sought by all france doesn't matter what he has done we'll think of that later they don't some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a and take a lot of time avoiding <UNK> etc everybody <UNK> <UNK> in films just <UNK> this it's bound to work it doesn't no humour no character ok <UNK> <UNK> does get to ham it a <UNK> bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent it'll make them seem <UNK> but also save us writing their lines we'd better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so let's have something to make them <UNK> with <UNK> we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his <UNK> a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his <UNK> care and if not <UNK> them oh the crooked cop was a <UNK> of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh let's have them all die at the end or we'll never finish this stuff is it in the can right that's over with then thank god <UNK> we get for director
<START> when this show first came on the air i saw it once or twice and thought it was another fat guy skinny wife show that seemed to <UNK> the networks at the time it was just okay upon initial viewings and i didn't watch it again however once it went into <UNK> i caught several episodes simply because it was on twice a night and i'm telling you the more you watch this show the funnier it is once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected this show makes you laugh out loud every new episode i watch is more creative than the one before people who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this the writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first this is far from according to jim first of all kevin james is hysterical incredibly charming and a talented comedic actor as is the supporting cast <UNK> has excellent timing and <UNK> <UNK> is one of the funnier characters on the show and of course jerry stiller is brilliant as arthur i was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great his delivery of these ridiculous schemes <UNK> out the crazy dad character are beyond hilarious and the yelling the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling <UNK> that episode during which carrie takes him to a <UNK> in hopes to get him <UNK> to make doug less <UNK> out guest star william hurt decides that arthur yells because he's never been <UNK> the latter part of the episode where doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny it's one of the most creative scenes i've seen on a sitcom i feel the strange need to defend this show because it is severely underrated while friends was sometimes amusing and raymond has some great episodes and characters they both lacked the creative touch that king of queens has in an era where most sitcoms have <UNK> jokes and are on the whole mediocre king of queens continues to push the sitcom <UNK> and show real comic genius critics of this show obviously don't get it or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching it's certainly on par with my other two favorites seinfeld and the office in its ridiculous tone it's the <UNK> and michael <UNK> of tv that keep us watching and laughing out loud
<START> i just saw this movie i liked the soundtrack i saw first the trailer and was magnificent like all hollywood movies they know how to sell but the movie is almost awful first 30 minutes are interesting but then like almost all new movies they blow it up i don't get the idea why that kid died is a cliché every movie must have a kid to be killed and everybody must become good after his death lol i don't understand what is the connection with the movie and is so predictable you know the end from the very first minutes nothing new in this movie i saw <UNK> got same idea but also something new this is something like but is not a little bit difference between them if you have no other option watch this movie but be sure is the last option you take and the choreography is worst than everything before this is not a must see for sure
<START> <UNK> what a mess we have here not so much of a mess as a painfully dull half <UNK> excuse for exploitation brought to you by the one and only j g pat <UNK> yeah the same one from <UNK> mountain doctor gore <UNK> known as the body shop is i guess somewhat inspired by frankenstein and god knows what else the late mr <UNK> also stars in this joke as a <UNK> scientist plastic surgeon who has recently lost his wife in a car accident and is driven insane from grief to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females then maybe rob a few graves for body parts in order to put together the perfect mate it won't be easy but thank goodness his pal <UNK> the <UNK> is available to lend a hand and to offer moral support br br if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished here it is gang this <UNK> <UNK> obviously never had any business directing anything much less following in the footsteps of good ol' h g as a master of gore i've never seen a gore movie that just flat out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching even the gore is boring almost remotely humorous at times but impossible to tell whether it's intentional or not i pick not br br shot in north <UNK> home of the california axe massacre on most likely a 3 <UNK> budget by a guy as <UNK> as he may have been who probably had an appreciation for drive in trash so maybe we should give good ol' j g a break i mean he tried i assume which is more that can be said for most and this movie is better than any of the big budget super hero garbage the theaters put out these days although i realize that isn't saying much besides doctor gore is quite the improvement over previous failure the chair so it's slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time had he not died so maybe it's not all that terrible especially compared to the other movie on the dvd how to make a doll so what the hell check it out 4 10
<START> but it's not the plot isn't all that bad the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those i can't believe he she is so dumb moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going it frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up a shame too since it got decent exposure upon release and hit right before the big halloween season even so i have a feeling this is going to get at least one sequel if not more so maybe they'll be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent
<START> yes i couldn't stop <UNK> nor could my partner incredibly boring 90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours and i'm not even a fan of action films but this just falls asleep on its feet unless you are a 70's <UNK> neck <UNK> fan br br some spoilers follow if you were expecting anything to happen don't hold your breath it doesn't br br but seriously it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher it's like a long boring and rather disjointed dream <UNK> <UNK> through it able to leave work whenever he wants and with attractive <UNK> bringing tea and messages constantly obviously not real life and an office with virtually no paper or files just a giant <UNK> to let you know that the film really is taking 6 months to watch br br <UNK> never seems to be touched by any real emotion neither does his wife and the children behave like <UNK> dolls in stark contrast to any real life even chloe despite her strong views never gives the appearance of really feeling anything the only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple <UNK> in a <UNK> and have nothing to do with the plot br br okay so maybe there are some moral <UNK> but if it's entertainment or even good cinematography you are looking for i think this film is incredibly over rated by most other viewers
<START> <UNK> elizabeth is a farm girl from the country coming to the city looking for love she has met a man that has told her of an <UNK> who will show her the stars this is a journey of souls <UNK> is put to the test can she realize her true love when she sees him or not tommy tommy lee jones is a construction worker trying to find himself in his native <UNK> they show each other different ways of looking at things all the while <UNK> is still looking for love and tommy is trying to protect the <UNK> that his grandmother lives on this is a twisted story of looking beyond the obvious and finding beauty in the simple everyday things the style is artsy and chock full of symbolism the psychedelic camera <UNK> might scare away the average <UNK> but the deeper message and the interesting frames make this movie worth watching it is a movie that explores the underworld of the weird wretched and <UNK> individuals this one <UNK> from the path but certainly worth watching
<START> whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever and it's usually some movie that's cool to hate like <UNK> the hands of fate or the <UNK> i ask them is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults does anyone utter the line <UNK> rather eat a in that movie br br this movie is way too <UNK> and moronic for adults and way too violent and irresponsible for children is there that much money in the <UNK> and butt head <UNK> to make a series of movies like this there is a problem child 3 but i haven't seen it i'd rather eat a turd
<START> hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film concerns about the known story of <UNK> marriage james stewart doris day in the first version leslie banks <UNK> best along with their 11 years old son travelling through <UNK> during <UNK> in a bus they know a sympathetic french person daniel in the old version pierre <UNK> while they are in they also know a couple bernard miles and brenda de and happen suddenly on the scene of a killing the dying <UNK> a political message then the child is <UNK> to ensure their silence and <UNK> gets help to inspector <UNK> ralph truman br br this is a superb movie about a family who stumbles on to an obscure international conspiracy and then they're forced into action is excellently played by james stewart and doris day this exciting film displays suspense intrigue tension and interesting drama well written by john michael hayes and charles bennett packs an ordinary theme of the suspense magician innocent people become caught up in a <UNK> intrigue and uncanny intelligent villains colorful and <UNK> cinematography shot in <UNK> and london studios by cameraman robert though with excessive <UNK> for scenes lavish sets by henry hitchcock's usual and working until his recent death of course the highlights are the happenings of the famous royal albert hall of london assassination where a <UNK> killer <UNK> tries to <UNK> while composer bernard <UNK> is <UNK> orchestra besides at the climax doris day singing <UNK> <UNK> meantime her son suffering risks the song won oscar for ray evans jay <UNK> the story was <UNK> reviewed for its double characters but today is considered a classic movie and fairly entertaining rating better than average hitchcock's enthusiastic no doubt will enjoy it
<START> terrific little film that stars mary <UNK> as a go <UNK> who works her way up as a struggling paper company but when the owner has to sell for health reasons she comes up with a scheme for the employees to buy the company with a jerk salesman robert <UNK> as the front even though she is the brains br br of course he becomes a big success and she becomes his executive secretary basically still running everything and teaching him class she loves the <UNK> but he never catches on as he fools around with a string of <UNK> she is chased by a married but separated man <UNK> cortez who isn't free but when a society gal catches <UNK> everything goes to hell br br <UNK> is just wonderful as the too smart woman who almost makes a huge mistake after she loses her man <UNK> is good as the jerk but what does she see in him and cortez is good but doesn't have much to do kitty kelly is good as the sidekick <UNK> charles <UNK> is the original owner <UNK> owen is the society babe and <UNK> murphy is funny as daisy br br worth a look
<START> with a film starring the twins <UNK> <UNK> and edison <UNK> nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywood style vampires no <UNK> chinese <UNK> here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chan br br sure the kung fu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettable br br but for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better
<START> this movie is hilarious what is better than watching two creatures battle one another giant cgi versions of these <UNK> which battle however i do require one of the guns used in the movie because apparently they are using <UNK> count the amount of shots they use before having to oh wait that's right they never have to <UNK> regardless count the shots it's hilarious br br the sound effects used in the movie for the <UNK> <UNK> from a tiger to an elephant oh and did i forget to mention that apparently these giant <UNK> dragons are <UNK> as hell because somehow even when the actors are looking in the direction that the beast comes from they are surprised when it appears br br whenever someone dies you can tell its coming because they all <UNK> for it they put their arms up in the air and cross them to save themselves it never works br br the final gem is that these script writers brains are just a <UNK> full <UNK> knowledge with facts such as both of these creatures being <UNK> to comments such as helpless animals they are just full of fun facts
<START> lives upstairs is a very bad movie in my world history class our teacher had us watch this movie and <UNK> to be able to compare the two <UNK> or something we watched <UNK> first and it was a very good movie but when she had us watch this movie directly after that i couldn't believe what i was seeing the acting was horrific the costumes were ugly the little boy's was especially ugly and <UNK> and the cinematography was z grade my friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner i understand this was a t v movie from canada and probably cost 10 to make but please they could have done better i have seen a few good t v movies in my time but this was not one of them the biggest thing that i don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch immortal beloved or something how is it possible to compare <UNK> when given the movie <UNK> for <UNK> and lives upstairs for it's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for i give <UNK> an a 9 out of 10 if anyone cares to know but lives upstairs gets an f 1 out of 10
<START> i cannot believe it has been 25 <UNK> since i first watched this story on tv i remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the vhs tape several years ago i did not watch it again until just recently i have been watched it over and over ever since i must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 br br the acting is superb the story is compelling and i am embarrassed to say that i did not appreciate actor bryan <UNK> talent until now the playful facial expressions shown in the first half when he gave jean the stolen medicine in is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half in their first drink together in and the <UNK> of the <UNK> we have to wait until the wedding reception especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for jean the same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in who wouldn't want to be his mrs br br while joe changed from a cocky almost bigger than life figure in the jungle to a somewhat self conscious average joe in his own backyard jean took the opposite road her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence she wasted no time and went after what she wanted she took steps to take what she could get exactly as joe had told her to once upon a time br br for me all these <UNK> helps to show this is more than just a love story this is a story about growth courage and <UNK> in life the <UNK> <UNK> is both a sweet and sad figure he too gave much to jean he gave his last hope for love at the end he did what true love requires he put her happiness ahead of his own br br i happened to like the fight between joe jean that was not in the book i thought it's an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible br br now i am older maybe i understand life love and loss a little better this story touches me even deeper br br i am however surprised to see b brown has blue eyes in the <UNK> photo shown on this site he most definitely did not in a town like alice well 25 <UNK> is a long time
<START> this feels as if it is a czech version of pearl harbor it has a same story both guys fall in love with the same woman and add to the twist the woman is actually a married one whose husband has been missing for a year i don't think that the story line is too strong the younger guy is quite naughty that is cute it kept me watching because of the emotional music and the pleasing scenes one after another it also has some strong visual special affects best of all the love stories is <UNK> integrated with the story br br i think that if it was in english it would be such a big shot all across the states it is too bad that not that many people are open for foreign movies
<START> this is the kind of film that might give you a nightmare besides that it's a lot of fun br br <UNK> wars is the only good spoof on star wars other films like <UNK> have failed this is the only good spoof film i have ever seen it doesn't rip off star wars it makes fun of it and that's what spoofs are supposed to be
<START> i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night frankly i have never heard about this movie before simply i lost track of recent movies for each one is worst than the previous one here again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted <UNK> the plot is ridiculous acting is below zero and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart i simply don't have any idea why seagal did this movie man it is even worst than out for a kill if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal he seems to be running out of ideas enthusiasm and money avoid this movie and do something worthwhile
<START> a very good movie about anti <UNK> near the end of wwii the scene that really speaks <UNK> of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest is giving his speech against the international money and <UNK> it sounds amazingly like the speeches that <UNK> hitler used to force down his <UNK> throats yet none of the meeting <UNK> seem to make this comparison
<START> am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the 1934 english film the english version has no suspense looks <UNK> and very low budget and has <UNK> acting except for peter lorre the 1956 version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert <UNK> sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard <UNK> music is far more exciting than the original version even though it's basically the same music the only flaw in the 1956 film is the ridiculous encounter in the <UNK> shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better
<START> a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr joan claiming to be the demon kane <UNK> the <UNK> of the 13th level of the hell and he would like to tell weird things he tells that he had made a deal with <UNK> to become human again he should knock up his virgin sister mary elizabeth alison <UNK> on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti christ and then he would escape from the pit and <UNK> when mary elizabeth gets pregnant her <UNK> and abusive sister catherine denise crosby does not believe that she is virgin but their father and former albert martino james callahan <UNK> his daughter and sees her intact <UNK> meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary <UNK> <UNK> and sends the priest and former military father anthony eddie <UNK> to spy mary elizabeth she is dominated by the <UNK> and forced to kill a truck driver lars <UNK> who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their <UNK> but she believes that she has nightmares however during the she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her <UNK> but it is too late br br the awful born is a b movie actually a z movie that believes that is a great movie the result is a pretentious and disappointing production with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction the plot is a complete mess there is a priest that is a hit man and former soldier a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric a father that <UNK> the virginity of his daughter two female demons <UNK> that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their <UNK> a character that is a slut and only exists to expose her beautiful body there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity but the worst is the acting the unknown lead actress alison <UNK> is <UNK> with ridiculous voices and <UNK> sorry ms alison <UNK> but i hated your annoying performance i have not recognized joan who has a good performance since i still had the image of her youth denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody she got older but she is still a good actress i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b movie the story might have worked better and better my vote is three br br title brazil o anti <UNK> the anti christ
<START> <UNK> from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time you know that the characters after finding out that the so called gift from god was actually a <UNK> will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end but how they get there is not as obvious the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters <UNK> their lives and where they are going the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip frank <UNK> shirley jones and <UNK> <UNK> prove that they are capable of more than playing the <UNK> mother <UNK> or <UNK> friend <UNK> while jill <UNK> and <UNK> play characters different than we have seen on their tv series ursula <UNK> portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> it's strange while the film features full x rated sex scenes and violent murders it never feels as shocking as it ought to br br a group of scientists go to an island in the <UNK> to investigate a <UNK> incident upon their arrival a mutated <UNK> goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women doesn't it always seem to work out that way br br among the acts we find a some lesbian encounters a three way with male prostitutes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the rape of an already dead body even though it's all fully explicit it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex br br there is some blood and gore with the murders but given that this is a <UNK> flick it's really tame for a much more rounded experience watch the similar nights of the living <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> i just watched for the first time since seeing it in the theater almost 20 years ago and while i remember liking it at the time i don't remember being blown away by it like i was today i really can't complain about anything in this movie craig <UNK> is excellent as the lead character of <UNK> i never understood why he hasn't had a more successful career because most of his early work is outstanding as good as <UNK> is <UNK> is even better his portrayal of the psycho dr <UNK> is unforgettable and steals the show the rest of the cast which includes doug <UNK> is very good save for the ridiculously over the top redneck sheriff the visuals are good and in some shots great the danny <UNK> composed score is as good as it gets and is among his best work the ending was epic with <UNK> action for close to twenty minutes overall is a tremendous accomplishment for clive barker and ranks as my favorite of his movies just slightly ahead of <UNK> 9 10
<START> a long time ago way back in the early '80s a late night tv show <UNK> came to abc trying to steal the <UNK> away from <UNK> badly listing saturday night live it didn't but it did introduce some <UNK> sketches and semi talented comedians to the world like mark for example br br which in a <UNK> way brings us to <UNK> and hyde together again which is <UNK> in ways all its own br br is about as subtle as a <UNK> full of <UNK> <UNK> going off after <UNK> and about as <UNK> too this is just his drugged out character he played on the ill <UNK> <UNK> show stretched out to feature length and if you didn't like him there why are you reading this review br br any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie that's a bad sign then when it goes for headed jokes that would get you thrown off every <UNK> stage in the western <UNK> and <UNK> gags with gross out things can only get worse br br a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of <UNK> fall of the house of <UNK> br br aside from a few very few gags that give a slight grin this whole film is an exercise in waste wasted actors wasted film wasted opportunities br br no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave what more <UNK> a review could they give themselves br br no stars no not even for armstrong who should have known better br br hyde from this one
<START> hunk of trash only the full moon studios could make has a group of college kids staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing as a demonic creature with two faces barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient <UNK> someone amongst them it won't be too hard to prove but a slight twist is so revealed and <UNK> executed you'll just <UNK> is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone br br cheap badly acted mess has a that's it kind of weak ending that'll have you <UNK> at why you just wasted your time <UNK> <UNK> who couldn't act her way through a wet paper sack has the heroine duties as the <UNK> member of the college <UNK> bunch named clark oh and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it's next victim
<START> when the <UNK> come they will not be bearing gifts no they bring with them war war and conquest as any familiar with this episode know it is a <UNK> of the war film the enemy below from the fifties the obvious difference is that instead of a <UNK> and a submarine or an american <UNK> german u boat engaged in lethal war games it is two <UNK> in outer space in trek history about 100 years before the events here according to this episode earth fought the wars after about 5 years of conflict a <UNK> brought about a <UNK> and the institution of the neutral zone a <UNK> between us and the empire now on this the <UNK> appears to be broken as our <UNK> are being attacked and destroyed by some weapon of immense power yes the <UNK> are back testing their new war toy and kirk must now earn his pay he must make decisions that would affect this <UNK> of the galaxy such as <UNK> out how to avoid a oh i <UNK> an <UNK> war maybe br br i think what makes this episode so effective is that it doesn't shy away from the grim aspects of war as one would expect of a mere tv episode from the sixties especially an episode from a science fiction show it's all very tense and gripping like the best war films such as when kirk sits down with his key officers for what amounts to a war <UNK> the writers and the actors aren't kidding around here this is all <UNK> for a ghastly conflict potentially the beginning of another years long <UNK> in the final analysis <UNK> aim is to keep this <UNK> to just the two ships but even then it's an <UNK> <UNK> with peril and <UNK> <UNK> in fact i believe this episode holds the record for ship <UNK> by the end of it right at the start of the episode we see the <UNK> such battle can produce in that supposedly well <UNK> <UNK> then begin the cat and mouse war games between the enterprise and the ship it's as exciting as any conflict we've seen on the big screen of course if you're not into war films you'd have to look for other things to admire in this episode br br what <UNK> this episode even further is the revelation of just what and who the <UNK> are it's an electric shock of a sort now we have even further inter crew conflict on the bridge of the enterprise war does tend to bring out the worst in some people due to still nasty attitudes about race in this future the tension is up even further kirk has his hands full in this one i suppose the one weakness in the story is the convenient of the <UNK> issue by the conclusion on the side actor makes his first appearance in the trek universe as the commander he's terrific in the role the flip side of capt kirk or capt <UNK> take your pick done up to resemble spock more than a little surprisingly his character is not war hungry as we would expect another eye opener for this episode the actor would next return to this universe as <UNK> father so he's nothing if not versatile it's also telling how the first appearance of such characters as the <UNK> is usually their best shot as it is here they showed up in the enterprise incident next
<START> spoilers included br br alfred hitchcock's brilliant and innovative adaptation of robert novel was an amazing film unlike anything previous every shot every camera angle every nuance was perfect he didn't just break the rules he made up a whole set of new ones br br here's the spoiler there is absolutely nothing new different or original about this movie gus van <UNK> doesn't just pay a homage to <UNK> he rips off every idea and does so in a less original more conventional manner i didn't have anything against gus van <UNK> before i saw this movie i liked <UNK> cowboy and i thought my own private <UNK> was a very interesting film the question burning in my mind when it comes to the remake of psycho is why did you do it gus br br in my mind there are only two reasons to do a remake 1 the original was a good story but the movie sucked 2 the original was a good movie but someone has thought of a fresh new approach to the material neither one of these factors is at all present in the gus van <UNK> version of psycho apart from the fact that it is in color and there is one scene in which there is a montage of disturbing imagery relating to the title character's possible inner dialogue which i found unnecessary there is nothing new here br br furthermore i found the casting left something to be desired anne <UNK> was okay as marion but she lacked a certain vulnerability that janet leigh portrayed in the original i didn't feel as sympathetic towards her character because the choices she faced seemed far less <UNK> as a woman in today's society as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960's vince vaughn got a few laughs with his rendering of an incredibly naive norman bates but i feel that anthony timing and nervous haunted look was much more effectively creepy the only performance that i enjoyed better than the original was the character of <UNK> <UNK> played by moore she was excellent as usual and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character br br to be fair there is some beautiful camera work especially during the famous bathroom scene in which van <UNK> takes advantage of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of <UNK> and yet during the whole film i had this irritating sense of <UNK> haven't i seen this somewhere before oh wait i have seen this somewhere before nearly every scene seems to be copied shot for shot from the original one almost gets the feeling the director made this film as a school project see i can make a hitchcock film too br br if you haven't already go see the original it's held up over the years and beats this bit of mediocrity hands down you won't be disappointed
<START> this is like a <UNK> <UNK> given that its depiction of animals is so accurate however here are a few details that appear to have been slightly <UNK> during the transition to film br br <UNK> bullets never hit giant <UNK> dragons it doesn't matter how many times you shoot at the <UNK> bullets just won't go near it br br the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant <UNK> or a giant <UNK> dragon is just to stand there the exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very still in which case you should run off until the <UNK> is right next to you and then you should stand there expecting defeat br br minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching br br 5 000 is a memory <UNK> tool and an ample substitute for losing your <UNK> license getting arrested br br members of elite army <UNK> don't see giant <UNK> dragons coming until they are within one of the over sized beings maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it br br when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and <UNK> you will need sound gear a second camera <UNK> etc are all superfluous br br when you hear a loud animal scream and one person has a gun he should take it out and point it at the nearest person br br when you take a gun out the sound of the safety being taken off will be made even if your finger is nowhere near the safety br br <UNK> agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something without having the <UNK> idea what they're exposing background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern <UNK> br br <UNK> hold at least <UNK> bullets in one clip and then more than that in the next clip despite that those with guns claim that they will need more <UNK> br br expensive cameras also remember that the reporter only has one camera are regularly left behind without even a <UNK> <UNK> or regret these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves br br the blonde girl really is the stupid one br br the same girl that says not to go into a house because a <UNK> dragon can easily run right through it thus making it <UNK> takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection and nobody says a word about it br br high tech <UNK> look like simple <UNK> with high school chemistry sets br br <UNK> <UNK> snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day but don't grow at all in the weeks either side br br the military <UNK> destroys entire islands when people don't meet contact <UNK> br br men with guns don't necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them instead they just keep shooting into the air br br the better looking you are the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures br br women's <UNK> is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds br br any time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age br br animal noises are an appropriate <UNK> noise for at the same volume br br old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military
<START> i honestly didn't think at first that this movie would make me laugh like hell and admire the great gore effects boy was i wrong from the very beginning to the very end the film showed some great gore effects accompanied by spoofs from other titles like evil dead and <UNK> this movie could be compared to peter jackson's works of art though this movie isn't as gory as <UNK> but i sure wait these make another splatter movie
<START> not many people remember the carey treatment and i can't say i blame them br br blake <UNK> did this during his lean years i e between pink <UNK> movies and for a story of a doctor turned detective coburn working to solve a murder in his hospital it's actually pretty forgettable br br coburn is <UNK> as always and o'neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings the story twists and turns aren't very involving and even the climax which is supposed to be nerve <UNK> is gut wrenching instead br br a missed opportunity altogether and an unfortunate one at that since it was based on a michael <UNK> book br br oh well at least <UNK> didn't write a sequel to it br br one star carey on coburn
<START> the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless <UNK> the film is beautifully written acted and directed and i highly recommend it br br tom was the <UNK> rich and successful owner of a large <UNK> <UNK> his board of directors and his competition <UNK> his employees <UNK> <UNK> ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of <UNK> success when he met her he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a for the <UNK> sally teaches him to read and takes over his job while tom goes to school he starts to rise one step at a time through the <UNK> <UNK> until he eventually takes over as president br br but as tom becomes a business <UNK> his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces his spoiled son <UNK> him and he takes up with a much younger woman the <UNK> named eve with predictably <UNK> consequences in his business life tom is a total success in his personal life a disastrous failure much like the <UNK> figure in citizen kane tom <UNK> the best and the worst of the <UNK> system br br spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity <UNK> moore is also excellent as sally both of them age beautifully in the multi <UNK> story the film was written by preston <UNK> but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which <UNK> became famous
<START> this movie was playing on lifetime movie network last month and i decided to check it out i watched for the first 20 minutes and then shut it off b c i am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage br br the movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a <UNK> off the road leaves to get help returns only to find out that it's being called a hit and run and there's a hunt for the <UNK> that hurt in the end killed her br br this is a movie about a female in an <UNK> neighborhood who has 2 small grade school children and who is an active <UNK> woman and yet in order for this movie to work it needs to be believable that she does not own a cell phone sorry but that's complete <UNK> especially when everyone else seems to have one they used theirs to call <UNK> when they found the girl lying on the side of the road when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone <UNK> at some when the lead female comes back the <UNK> is already at the girl's side and there is <UNK> about how horrible the person is who hit and left her br br just dumb sorry but i am not willing buy that this woman doesn't own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work please don't insult my intelligence movie thanks maybe if this took place in 1970 or 1960 i'd buy it but it's clearly a present day 1999 at the time movie but wait if she had a cell phone there would be no movie <UNK> br br the woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car making her resort to another way to call the cops leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot
<START> my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is when we rented it last weekend we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years or so ago we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series which in its one hour segments was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines this movie leaves many loose threads as has been mentioned by others here basically every main character's story line is left <UNK> br br gotta like the title song though
<START> i loved this show i think the first time i tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something i actually wrote back and forth with <UNK> for several years i lost touch and wish i could <UNK> now as adults anyone know where she is now i wish they would put it out on dvd i seriously doubt that since i think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place they just don't make shows like this anymore do they i wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age do you guys know anyone that could burn dvd's of the show they taped on vhs i'd be willing to pay within reason
<START> another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american <UNK> imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family all recovering following the suicide of their <UNK> son br br the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy <UNK> weaver and tim <UNK> <UNK> both acting out in different ways as a result of the death while tim experiments with <UNK> <UNK> and his own sexuality sandy <UNK> to her former self smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity br br the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well especially when references are made to both of them being <UNK> from their own family sandy due to her affair and tim initially due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother considerably less time is allowed for <UNK> husband ben jeff daniels who in a devastating depiction of denial orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table michelle <UNK> older sister penny is <UNK> and could easily be taken out of the film br br despite its long runtime imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer director dan harris may have liked and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas but despite some issues the central performances from weaver and <UNK> are stunning and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion br br rating b
<START> sorry about that but if you have seen this epic you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the bible now i'm not exactly the next in line for <UNK> but i do know the <UNK> and the <UNK> were this god wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the earth because he believed they have been <UNK> to the point of no return he chose <UNK> the diamond in the rough and his family to be <UNK> due to their ways <UNK> builds an <UNK> as <UNK> by god to house he his family and two of every creature while he <UNK> the rest of the planet those are the <UNK> in this movie you have other people <UNK> around the <UNK> such as <UNK> and pirates but i thought that everyone was wiped out i guess the executives at nbc have never been to church there are other inaccuracies i'm told but being the average joe i have no idea what they are sorry back to the movie it was inaccurate as stated before the acting <UNK> but some of the effects were good i'll give it that but as a whole i've seen a better and more <UNK> rendition of the story done as a little scene on the simpsons god help the nbc executives come judgement day 3 10
<START> kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well but kevin spacey as a mafia leader or even a <UNK> i'm not so sure he could go that far the movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me br br i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines but i'm not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out silly isn't it but i'm pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same <UNK> as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie but now you have to do ten lines wow that should do it d br br 3 10
<START> sean connery is very good as the great lord of the <UNK> and <UNK> of the faithful this is an adventure movie with <UNK> germans and the <UNK> all coming to grips at one point or another there is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters the story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy greek american businessman was kidnapped by the in the early <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping and this opens the story to a lot of literary license br br on the other hand the movie gives <UNK> the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous though mostly forgotten political <UNK> of the <UNK> era brian keith very good as <UNK> says alive or the dead and john huston also good as <UNK> of state john <UNK> asks the japanese <UNK> at a white house dinner you you
<START> this film got <UNK> by the boys at mst3k but it's actually a neat and nasty piece of low budget film noir the plot is tight the characters are believable within the good boy gets obsessed with bad girl genre the pacing is solid the climax is well handled and the cast is <UNK> by several fine character actors true most of the time you want to hit the protagonist with a brick but he's actually quite effectively creepy when he plays the mastermind the scenes between him and his dad are quite powerful in a <UNK> kind of way sure it's depressing but that's the point good movie
<START> this is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been a relationship as it's about to end <UNK> <UNK> performance as <UNK> desperately trying to hold onto her connection with bobby for just one more day is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out <UNK> just one more night when he does give her one more night the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be and how each one whether permanent or not should be treated with respect rather than simply thrown away
<START> yes we all know about dan <UNK> odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and is no exception see young girls <UNK> their <UNK> and stick their <UNK> out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and <UNK> yes it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older <UNK> crowd either way the show isn't that good when compared to dan other shows like the far superior amanda show drake and josh br br the show is about a brother and sister <UNK> and spencer living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives <UNK> has a mean spirited friend named sam and they do a very well produced award winning web show called with their little school friend <UNK> the episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi <UNK> at school br br <UNK> is a young all knowing web personality business woman producer played by miranda <UNK> a young actress who relies on talking very very <UNK> and fast to get her point across and making odd faces her brother spencer is a somewhat mean spirited dim wit and eccentric artist played by jerry <UNK> who tries a bit to hard to be like jim carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who'd like this type of joey <UNK> humor then there's sam <UNK> an unlikable mean little lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who clearly wears hair <UNK> as you can see them disappear then <UNK> from scene to scene and finally there's <UNK> benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical <UNK> who has a major crush on <UNK> but will obviously get nowhere with her who's played by nathan br br other secondary characters come and go such as mother grandfather annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast most of the comedy is mean spirited like blowing up the <UNK> as a gag throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl <UNK> selling <UNK> all of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing and certain main characters have absolutely no morals lying cheating stealing and violence all are acceptable in this children's show created and written by dan schneider yes it's a children's show what more could the young viewers ask for well with dan schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and <UNK> and do some odd things like sticking their <UNK> out for the camera and eating br br shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and i guess no worse then any of the other garbage nick <UNK> at its young crowd there's always fans to be found for anything seen on tv at least this is a bit better then most of the stuff seen on nick like that horrible naked brothers show
<START> perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin <UNK> well his <UNK> is not on the top of my all time horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between pin and child's play both better than this one but not so better sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good <UNK> allen is very pleasant to the eye and so is <UNK> god bless her for the shower scene the child actress is very good in <UNK> the disturbed daughter and the <UNK> puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine for a b movie not bad at all
<START> it was probably watching this tv movie that got me interested in the debate as to whether anna was really daughter <UNK> since seeing it i have made a point of watching various documentaries and also bought a book despite the evidence that has been discovered since the film was released i sometimes still think she was such is the power of amy <UNK> acting in this 2 <UNK> which is somewhat liberal with the historical facts but packed to the <UNK> with tear <UNK> drama and <UNK> totally convincing performance br br i was not <UNK> aware of irving before this though i must have seen her without realizing it in carrie another favourite film in i never felt for one moment that it's only a film for me this woman was <UNK> and when part one ended with her in the <UNK> <UNK> meeting members of the royal family i knew that come hell or high water i had to see the second part i just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she claimed to be and as the story progressed i felt an intense hatred of rex <UNK> character though i greatly admire him as an actor br br when i saw the movie listed again in the tv guide i convinced my mother that we should watch it and afterward she <UNK> me for doing so being almost as keen as i had been to watch part 2 then i bought the video and can totally recommend it <UNK> is one of those rare tv movies that you simply must watch for the sheer enjoyment of watching the finest acting i have ever seen on tv and it doesn't really matter whether you believe the legend or not
<START> what could've been a great film about the late poker pro pre poker <UNK> <UNK> the kid <UNK> turned into a disappointment br br you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short string budget everything look filmed on the cheap <UNK> seemed a bit off to me br br casting michael from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice he looked too old to play the baby faced <UNK> he looked way too healthy for a coke addict if you look at footage from the 1997 main event the real <UNK> was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those <UNK> to hide them and i kept expecting <UNK> to pop up and yell chris <UNK> br br also they <UNK> over the fact that he had a son from <UNK> previous relationship that committed suicide in the late '80s br br every time i saw vincent van <UNK> appear i kept thinking he was going to <UNK> show tunes going off in head like he does on the br br if you're looking for real footage check <UNK> classic because they <UNK> the 1997 main event every so often or try youtube avoid this move like a bad beat
<START> i watched the premiere of path to paradise way back and was stunned by it dramatic license and all i lived in nyc brooklyn a few years and kept in mind today given the <UNK> to groups such as al <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> i see it as a warning not recognized by our government for that i place the blame on our <UNK> and leaders 9 11 <UNK> was a new <UNK> to <UNK> two of our <UNK> of <UNK> and there is no excuse for our <UNK> to prevent it period path to paradise was but a dramatic view of the <UNK> preview and no one cared now nearly 3 000 deaths later and years behind we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve
<START> <UNK> of an <UNK> army unit hook up with a group of <UNK> to fight their way through indians on the <UNK> sounds like it could be an exciting western but this one is dull dull dull it moves like <UNK> the action scenes are uninspired the acting is pedestrian the writing is flat even the photography isn't very good eastwood in a very early role plays an ex <UNK> who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as <UNK> that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off and his character comes across as <UNK> rather than angry or <UNK> a very ordinary western actually a very less than ordinary western worth a look if you're a die hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career otherwise don't bother
<START> this was the very first movie i ever saw in the theatre by myself i was 7 years old and to this day it is one of my favorite movies it's pure smarmy cheese the cartoon was <UNK> towards young girls selling dolls with soft bodies and big plastic heads one for every colour of the <UNK> with their own special animals and even a talking <UNK> horse typical of the time period each show was about how hope <UNK> and magic can make <UNK> all br br the movie concerns the coming of spring when all the light and colour returns to the world but this time it just isn't happening for our lovely hero a spoiled princess plots to <UNK> the soul and implied life <UNK> of the universe which happens to be a giant diamond for her own <UNK> purposes with no regard for reality and now <UNK> and her newly found friends <UNK> <UNK> and chris must save the universe as i said before it's cheesy but it's cute and it's exactly like all of the other cartoons from that time period like the movies <UNK> <UNK> rose <UNK> and the <UNK> all movies created to sell dolls to kids and it works
<START> this has got to be the worst movie i <UNK> ever seen <UNK> in this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require <UNK> to be funny he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isn't the movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated if the whole movie had been animated it might have been good i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on on a scale of 1 10 i give this movie a score of 100
<START> the fun that was present in the other <UNK> has all but disappeared with this third effort which means the <UNK> production values show through more than ever another 2 <UNK> 'the chinese <UNK> together this one suffers from too much padding not to mention weak <UNK> action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park apartment and <UNK> press nicholas <UNK> is as endearing as ever struggling <UNK> against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast the plot in which peter and <UNK> help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by <UNK> three marines who could <UNK> as to his innocence doesn't exactly scream <UNK> book <UNK> to <UNK> does it
<START> <UNK> just beneath the surface of showtime is a good idea actually it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for <UNK> this film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too it has the whole <UNK> br br detective mitch preston robert de niro has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a <UNK> cop slash actor named <UNK> <UNK> eddie murphy when <UNK> partner is shot he <UNK> shoots the camera out of the hands of a <UNK> and the <UNK> lands him in a new reality cop show produced by chase <UNK> russo in the first of many errors and <UNK> in the movie that injured partner is never heard from again or <UNK> to for the remainder of the film br br de <UNK> best gag is his speech to a <UNK> of small children to open the picture about how tv cops don't act like real cops funny thing is as the movie progresses his character and murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with in a smarter movie de <UNK> <UNK> could have played as ironic comment here it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is while a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny the team of writers and director tom <UNK> who made the far superior shanghai <UNK> a few years ago see that movie instead seem to be on unsure <UNK> and instead of <UNK> the tv industry they really let them off light the <UNK> thing they seem to be able to say about network <UNK> is they like to play <UNK> <UNK> at work <UNK> character has a <UNK> of <UNK> delight in her eye but her dialogue and actions rarely match the <UNK> enthusiasm br br with little on screen to keep my attention my mind began to wander and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes for instance if showtime the name given to the cop show is such a popular smash why doesn't anyone seem to recognize de niro and murphy when they are on the job for that matter if their investigation of <UNK> and all around mean guy vargas is being <UNK> why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail then again given this <UNK> actions maybe i shouldn't be surprised this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new without <UNK> <UNK> a deal and then <UNK> him how by using about ten of the to level his entire house of course that's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire br br occasionally showtime gets laughs but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time even worse the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something if only they had put in a few more <UNK> of the script murphy <UNK> and talks as fast as he can with minimal results and de niro looks flat out bored through most of this after a completely unnecessary <UNK> between cops and gangsters that remarkably results in no <UNK> and no <UNK> <UNK> character shouts that's great television ' perhaps it's great television but it's far from a great movie
<START> did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from <UNK> why is it so difficult for this <UNK> to be original he even mentioned in an interview with that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters plots <UNK> and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with br br guess it isn't too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely br br i mean seriously what the hell here's something i made in <UNK> br br http com art uwe boll is a <UNK>
<START> is one of the best new danish tv series that i have watched br br the series is about the danish police <UNK> unit 1 a kinda fbi style team that help solve murder cases all over the country and the cases they work on plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team br br i didn't expect much when i started watching this series i was pleasantly surprised the series is exciting sometimes fun it's got both drama and suspense i love it
<START> french cinema sucks down with all these visions with their my god am i <UNK> distinguished attitudes <UNK> to <UNK> symbolic film language and <UNK> i'll no longer have a mind for that <UNK> did you ever think about that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid maybe i'm too common to understand you or had it been your task to confirm all the clichés of a frenchman the world can have <UNK> the to be comes to his home palace <UNK> <UNK> not in the picture plays the <UNK> here am i darling in this moment i knew that she's in the <UNK> and we ll see her lying in there soon don't <UNK> me i'm not <UNK> and the sex scene was the climax of the film but this is in berlin we say what means something like a self satisfied and the worst seen that often in french movies i can tell other example she beautiful and willing is looking at herself in a mirror <UNK> her hair and her wild <UNK> dirty young guru into the room breathless shouting there's no escape there's no escape forty years after and what's new what's exciting about my god there's that woman and she loves and <UNK> you what would be more natural to be happy with your life and when you're not please explain much better why born french means you have to live a life in <UNK> no escape is that the point
<START> well the movie has catherine zeta jones in it it's a hallmark television movie it's from a thomas hardy novel it has catherine zeta jones in it she is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class oh yes it has clive owen in it i'm not british so that means almost as much as being a thomas hardy novel except he was in the bourne identity and i liked that that just about <UNK> it all up folks that really all there was i'm becoming repetitive but i do like so i stuck it out to the end the computer is telling me that i don't have 10 lines and i keep counting them i always count 11 but maybe it just doesn't like my style but that is my opinion of the movie too
<START> i was one of the many fools who were <UNK> out into paying for this at the theater even though i <UNK> 4 bucks for <UNK> before <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> story was ho hum the cgi were lame the were to <UNK> today's <UNK> no i did not think the chick was hot at all the re killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel overall just a sad bad remake br br i'll take rod taylor and the fat glowing eyed <UNK> over this junk any time my <UNK> is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely <UNK> by today's confused and ever wanting more youth br br when the 60s version came out i first saw it in the 70s for summer fun it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up you don't have to have an over abundance of cgi in a movie for it to be better too much of this looks fake i can't say enough of how <UNK> bad the looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game 3 stars out of 10
<START> i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except cinema goers who like to laugh at a film not with it br br quite a promising premise and set of actors get <UNK> worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film i won't spoil it but basically the most over used set of movie cliches get done badly and half <UNK> for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film ever br br the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever the attempt at on screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie <UNK> denzel <UNK> finger lovingly it may be the only thing he could move but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of <UNK> finger getting <UNK> amidst the kind of <UNK> lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me i laughed out loud and <UNK> my head br br the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from <UNK> but here it is executed far more <UNK> and far too obviously to call it a poor mans <UNK> would be an understatement this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and <UNK> best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film
<START> a stupid movie with a stupid plot feels like they threw every imaginable cliché in a <UNK> i especially liked the part where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water because we all know how dedicated america is to <UNK> of the environment <UNK> anyone and the french chef who has apparently never seen or <UNK> a <UNK> this is why people think americans have no culture that and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to europe to see the world i e eat at <UNK> in foreign <UNK> they are not as dumb as the two <UNK> <UNK> in this movie but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners
<START> i can only assume the previous <UNK> came from <UNK> at the production company br br attended the uk premiere last night zane and <UNK> attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience <UNK> in laughter at what were serious <UNK> scenes br br but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue in cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career <UNK> br br on the plus side zane always shines and <UNK> can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema <UNK> broken <UNK> they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be <UNK>
<START> a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife's jealousy and drinking problems when the wife disappears her sister begins a <UNK> search involving the local police state government and a television crime show what she finds out <UNK> the entire community good drama with lots of fine performances based on a true story
<START> i liked this move when i was a kid but now that i'm older i can see how absurd the plot really is in case you didn't read the earlier reviews it's about a teenager and an air force colonel who steal two fully loaded f <UNK> to rescue said <UNK> dad br br it does have some nice <UNK> stunts even if the dialog accompanying then is basically <UNK> br br some unintentional humor in the edited for tv version when the hero's dad is being held by iran <UNK> i mean an <UNK> country and his <UNK> ask him for a confession relating to why he's being held don't worry about exactly why or what they want him to confuse to he says tell him he can take my confession and <UNK> it down his throat however his lips and more his gesture make it clear what motion and part of the <UNK> he was really thinking of
<START> take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks then you would have had a great story faith and <UNK> story and their relationship was the best part diaz and <UNK> were wonderful <UNK> was <UNK> to sit through surprised to see <UNK> <UNK> as mom she was great also look for patrick <UNK> as the father always like him sleeping with the enemy this is a very <UNK> save the world kind of film don't care for it much but i recommend seeing it for <UNK> performance alone she has excellent range and it should be used more <UNK> is as always compelling he's wonderful
<START> warning 1 tiny <UNK> spoiler you're right this was no bridges of madison county as soon as the lonely woman and richard gere checked into the big empty hotel it was a <UNK> conclusion something kind of fun would happen the question is how will it come about the answer is some stupid connect the <UNK> story not worth sitting through in one supposed bonding experience they get drunk and clean out the <UNK> of old <UNK> that was my spoiler and the next day they put them back lol it wasn't compelling at all i'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and my friendships are more interesting than her romance with richard gere lol it did have that advantage you walk away and go oh brother even i could have written something more believable than that i guess my life isn't quite as dull as i thought it was if i can <UNK> at a romance with richard gere lol and that friend inherited that totally contemporary probably computer generated mansion <UNK> half in the ocean from her grandmother who built it after the civil war maybe her grandmother is oprah and this was way after the civil war and yes where was the email what alternative universe do these people live in i never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email and <UNK> and and ok maybe these people have a horrible <UNK> to delivering news over the phone but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first
<START> even though this was a well told story i found it too unpleasant the main subject is child abuse which is never fun to see a <UNK> topic add to that a lot of profanity by the <UNK> husband and a by a little kid no less and this movie turned me off as far as ever seeing it again br br also portrayed in here were <UNK> picking on the two little boys another unpleasant viewing experience the realism of the story takes a <UNK> dive when one of the boys flies away on a home made airplane give me a break br br the only positive enjoyable part of this movie is seeing the nice loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers played by <UNK> wood and joseph the latter became a familiar face in the next couple of years with big roles in jurassic park and the river wild wood of course didn't hit it big until a decade later but he made it very big in the lord of the rings trilogy those two kids and narration by an <UNK> tom hanks are the only <UNK> of this film i liked
<START> seymour <UNK> gives a great performance a tour de force his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke will always have a place in my heart the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of <UNK> his dead brother's dreams what he gets is lame surf <UNK> guys cheating guys fighting and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing <UNK> is like touching a woman next time my woman talks back i will pretend i'm the ball br br back to seymour <UNK> the end of the movie turns into a good drama since the first half of the film really had no point duke plays a wonderful game of <UNK> the best he's played in over ten years the way the scene is shot is beautiful you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time 3 10 bad to fair the rest of the movie was lame
<START> i was one of the lucky people to be invited to view this film in new york it is a compelling story of how a group of extremely tight friends dealt with the tragedy of september <UNK> this film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create wonderful things out of one of our darkest days the film makers truly captured the emotions of the individuals involved it was amazing to see how the same story was told through the eyes of so many different people i walked out of the theater that day wanting to call all my friends just to say hello i would recommend everyone see this documentary i would rate this movie with an a see it if you get a chance
<START> there are so many holes in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i don't know much about george <UNK> but i've seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the loving father mad scientist vampire guy he looks so ordinary i'm surprised that he ended up in the genre this is the typical i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army by <UNK> wolf blood or is it <UNK> to his hired hand he turns him into a werewolf <UNK> strange who was one of <UNK> as the frankenstein monster plays the kindly lovable hired man who is <UNK> because he <UNK> the mad doctor at first the scientist is able to control when his name can be transformed but like the invisible man suddenly he starts <UNK> on his own and becomes a <UNK> there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice <UNK> miss brooks she wants to leave but her father the doctor won't allow that he is also driven by a group of his peers who <UNK> his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked it's not a very good movie the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters <UNK> around the spanish moss once again the <UNK> are a bunch of morons who look like they escaped from a bad western one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era there's also a <UNK> smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody <UNK> to her
<START> i love this show i watched every episode last year i bought the dvds and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have <UNK> this great show and you have taken what made it work and ruined it you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends sam <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i love the other characters as well but they are good in small <UNK> like derek <UNK> and even <UNK> it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in it is <UNK> while things are funny in small <UNK> when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying i was so looking forward to the return of this show so please bring back the charm even if you could not fit <UNK> into the show at least bring <UNK> back but i loved those girls they brought the fun the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well that was the charm and that great dog as well br br i hope the network fox forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up but <UNK> episodes were bad i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool because no one was laughing except 2 3 times i <UNK> to them and said i don't know what happened and about 10 minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show <UNK> or <UNK> and this was no longer a must see tv comedy
<START> i thought this movie was fun i have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really great first date film it had warmth and heart and spirit was kind of cheesy but in today's film industry cheesy is cute i gave it a ten and i highly suggest renting buying or seeing the movie anyway you can gene kelly was very dreamy and a little bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought that he was gonna have it all the female lead was cast perfect because their two personalities had spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen the grandma in the movie was priceless the perfect addition to a great old movie i love the fact it was black and white and gene kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help liking him see it
<START> i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad it's 4 3 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right br br if you want to see a good action boxing movie don't watch this one you'll end disappointed on this low budget movie like i did go and see ali its way better
<START> in one of the better movies of the year tom hanks stars as <UNK> charlie wilson in this <UNK> funny and extremely relevant given reasonably current events historical comedy drama surrounding the 1980s <UNK> soviet fiasco the <UNK> were attacking afghanistan killing hundreds of people why should anyone care people are dying right no the reason the united states got involved through charlie wilson was because the <UNK> in fear they would get blown to sh t started <UNK> coming into <UNK> which in turn p <UNK> <UNK> president <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> off charlie wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth <UNK> woman and religious fanatic in texas <UNK> <UNK> julia roberts and a amusing and <UNK> american spy for the cia <UNK> philip seymour hoffman to help supply <UNK> with high tech weapons to destroy soviet fight air craft that would try and attack their land br br although certainly not a serious oscar <UNK> for best picture <UNK> <UNK> is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year academy award winner mike <UNK> provides solid directing as to be expected while emmy award winner aaron <UNK> night the west wing provides a remarkable screenplay that near <UNK> <UNK> comedy and drama the acting is great for the most part as well tom hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 oscar nominated turn as a <UNK> worker stranded on a <UNK> island in <UNK> <UNK> hanks takes a slimy character like wilson and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy amy adams and ned beatty are reliable as always but the real stand out performance of the film is from philip seymour hoffman arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today hoffman takes a small supporting role and <UNK> everyone around him from his first scene where he's screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window hoffman sucks you in the only disappointing cast member is <UNK> overrated hollywood <UNK> julia roberts <UNK> her way through yet another movie <UNK> overbearing and over the top portrayal of a rich texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flat out annoying at <UNK> minutes the movie is short and sweet and that isn't to say it doesn't drag at some points but when it does drag it's for a very brief amount of time br br in conclusion <UNK> <UNK> is not a perfect film by any means but it's certainly worth a look grade b
<START> can you say boring with a capital b it's slower than watching grass grow it's more boring than watching paint dry you'll sleep right through it we all did don't do it you'll regret it
<START> jesus franco is pretty hit or miss on his films i'd say this was a miss that is unless you're into total sleaze i will say that the man has an eye for a good shot even if it involves topless women with machine guns <UNK> against the ocean this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible but the acting is the least of what this is about and what is it about well it's about <UNK> minutes of <UNK> women picking and <UNK> in the hot sun for no apparent reason and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some most notable is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently <UNK> german shepherd and while what's going on is merely implied thankfully it is probably a scenario that i could have done without i'd rank this up there with tender flesh as one of the franco films i'd rather not have in my collection although the music is <UNK> and fun 4 out of 10 <UNK>
<START> this music is totally out of touch with the film showing up now and then as <UNK> <UNK> and lone ranger hurry up otherwise nonexistent the acting outside of the two principals is nonexistent it would have been an excellent student film the russian soldiers are just models trying to act the constant <UNK> with wow explosive camera angles and clips of pieces of people were quite irritating but that's just a personal feeling the story line isn't worse than others actually not worse than most completely ignoring logic and reason and reality at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit the three top level bad guys were campy
<START> this film is too good for words its so unbelievably great and funny and true to life you just know from watching this that the person who wrote this has <UNK> felt the way that <UNK> and his friends do through the film it was my life at one point and i would rely on coming home to watch human traffic ever night before i could even think of going to bed i think you just get so loved up with the characters and their life style of course this film wouldn't be for old people more around the age of 16 to 22 i guess there is <UNK> nothing wrong with this film and it will have you in <UNK> all the way through it doesn't have a particular story line to it the general idea is a weekend in the life of older teens in london and what they get up to the places they go the people they meet the drugs they take and the experiences they have you have to get this movie on dvd never mind just watching it you have to have it
<START> i don't go for that many heist comedies and i might not care for this one if it weren't for the actors when it was made and when i first saw it just a few years later it's almost too similar to the happening even though it's obviously a much less serious comedy than that one mafia figure takes over his own kidnapping or rather turns it in a different direction altogether of course <UNK> welch didn't play the kind of sharp character faye <UNK> did in the happening but that doesn't make it a sexist film either she was practically playing a stock character almost her version of a <UNK> but i'm completely biased it's among the first films i ever saw with her and at the time i saw it you couldn't turn around without seeing a poster of her luckily i think robert wagner was really just right as the neither thoroughly likable nor <UNK> likable leader of the group as were edward g robinson naturally and de <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> an actor who always managed to be funny
<START> 11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb there is a reason for this utter lack of interest in across the moon it is coherent but lacks all cinematic virtue see this film for examples of terrible production in all respects the opening credits for instance are white letters rising <UNK> from a red background the ending features michael staring out a prison window saying there's lots of mysteries out there followed by a clip montage music video of all the uplifting moments in the <UNK> bad movie <UNK> everything in between is awful i <UNK> to find any value in this movie and have come up empty though it is hard to believe even a cameo role from burgess always a crowd <UNK> only disappointed me further this movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies on paper the movie is below average women living together in a trailer but what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable the movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any the unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved no conflict is ever resolved there really is no conflict the women attempt to become <UNK> but that never happens instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf sound exciting it wasn't it was stupid and the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and <UNK> contrived conflict the women are capable actresses but the script was beyond poor useless this was a terrible movie but it is even worst that they <UNK> burgess out of his retirement home to make it bad from start to finish like the lion without teeth this film has no bite
<START> <UNK> vs <UNK> is not going to set the world on fire it's not a hallmark of cinema history what it is is a group of <UNK> filmmakers trying to make another movie make another paycheck and continue to support themselves and their families as such i give these efforts a lot of slack i mean come on it has to be hard to be a russian special effects <UNK> not a lot of big budget films getting made there but they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame american monster flick needs <UNK> <UNK> and i get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks if for some reason you find yourself watching this again look at the sequence where <UNK> and company are walking through a jungle look at their feet and you'll see <UNK> <UNK> and if you happen to still have a copy of <UNK> assault shown a week or two earlier also on scifi you'll see the folks in there through the same <UNK> jungle come to think of it i think the <UNK> land in the same <UNK> in both flicks i can admire the of these films every dollar really does show up on the screen too bad there just aren't enough dollars
<START> fires on the plain 1959 br br you don't see films like this anymore on the is an incredible depiction of the lives of the soldiers of the japanese <UNK> army <UNK> masterpiece follows <UNK> a soldier with <UNK> as he wanders around the <UNK> landscape in the last year of the war he is sent away to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and so he is sent back his co tells him to go back and if they refuse him again then his last order is to kill himself with his <UNK> he is refused again but meets up with a band of <UNK> sitting outside the hospital the next day they are <UNK> by american troops and <UNK> <UNK> choosing not to kill himself and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to he discovers that some men have been eating human flesh in order to survive while others trade as much <UNK> as they can for whatever they can get back br br the film is filled with a quiet sense of desperation and <UNK> with a hint of insanity everyone we see is skin and bones covered in dirt wearing torn and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uses his camera to catch some beautiful shots of the <UNK> landscape and the japanese soldiers who walk it <UNK> <UNK> was famous in japan for making many comedies and <UNK> and there are moments in fires on the plain that are <UNK> hilarious take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a pool of water a soldier walks but and asks himself <UNK> if that is how they will all end up to which the man lifts his head out of the water and replies what was that and then drops his face even deeper into the <UNK> than before another hilarious sequence involves one man finding a pair of boots along the trail he takes the boots replacing them with his old ones another man walks by and sees that pair of boots and switches up for his old boots the scene continues until finally <UNK> finds the exchange spot and <UNK> the boots left without hardly any sole he looks carefully at his own and at ones on the ground and deciding that they're both he <UNK> his own and goes <UNK> the film is filled with incredible scenes one after another like and kurosawa <UNK> knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and stunning pictures there are many stunning shots of men in <UNK> empty <UNK> surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the broken earth there is another incredible scene where dozens of japanese soldiers attempt to cross a road <UNK> by <UNK> in the middle of the night all <UNK> on their hands and knees as the camera watches on from above br br the film gets its name from the <UNK> of smoke rising up from fires on the <UNK> seen throughout the film they represent to the soldiers life a little more ordinary the lives of japanese <UNK> back home burning <UNK> of corn their of hope for the normal life however are in hostile hands br br the film caused a stir in its day with its graphic content much emphasis is placed on the horror of war not just with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself <UNK> fires on the <UNK> is an incredibly authentic and moving and somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror suffered by the men making up the lower ranks of the <UNK> army clint eastwood's letters from <UNK> <UNK> while it is a very good film comes nowhere close to realizing the horror of war depicted in fires on the plain eastwood was no doubt influenced by the film seeing as he claims to be such a classic japanese film buff many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners in fires on the plain we're shown that war is even more <UNK> when you're on the losing end br br 4 4
<START> i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning well i was drawn to the fact that it's an <UNK> movie i was hoping to find some nice <UNK> but it the views where just limited they just go back and forth in the same spot all over again i hate it when they're using this so called hi tech <UNK> like the this <UNK> blue tooth <UNK> they're using to eliminate the use of a <UNK> <UNK> it was just so funny they look like amateurs and they where like advertising those badly designed alien <UNK> that could link up to a satellite to find people i couldn't say more about this tv movie the ending was bad that it looks like they cut it short <UNK> the use of rescue <UNK> and etc
<START> <UNK> a disney sequel that is rubbish who would have thought it actually quite a lot judging by the comments here and they aren't wrong i actually looked forward to seeing this awful film based on my liking of the original and <UNK> lies disney's whole cash in mentality <UNK> out any old junk on the back of a success and people will go for it don't think they are that cynical ask yourself this then how many disney films have sequels and then how many of those sequels <UNK> a follow up a significantly lower number br br new groove is just another example of this the plot is laughably simplistic and drawn out even more annoying was the <UNK> number of out of place items and scenes an old folks home for example and god <UNK> an aztec version of the boy <UNK> worse yet <UNK> leader has a completely <UNK> over the top english accent for no reason whatsoever an accent that was after a very short while intensely grating on the nerves br br there are a couple of good things the animation is very nice and the voice talent do well with the sub standard dialogue they are given especially <UNK> in the lead role but other than this there really is nothing to recommend it sure little kids may like it but there is little to <UNK> mum and dad whilst they sit through this <UNK> <UNK> of the original concept br br avoid this monstrosity with the same <UNK> you'd use in avoiding a pack of <UNK> man eating lions
<START> unbelievable philosophy depth genius masterpiece people must have seen another <UNK> because the one i've seen was a badly written poorly conceived over the top acted <UNK> piece of which even ignoring for a moment the <UNK> violent scenes which makes it <UNK> for the eyes of a child could barely satisfy the imagination and the <UNK> for plot <UNK> of a seven years old br br the depth of this sorry <UNK> was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom laugh and the whole world will laugh with you <UNK> and you'll find yourself alone the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author be him shakespeare or more to the point of imdb kurosawa would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts where this movie should have landed too if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the <UNK> disgusting are confused with what used to be named once great art in short <UNK> br br 2 out of 100 it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera work in no way enough to save this <UNK> failure from <UNK> though
<START> that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie not waste as in a waste of time any time spent with these characters is never wasted but waste as in a waste of opportunities br br when i see this movie i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose the setup was like an average television episode while the finish felt like the climax if you can call it that of the first movie br br <UNK> in directing ii iv focused on the character of spock how he faced the <UNK> outside of the <UNK> and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh shatner could have done the same with kirk here but he didn't we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before again one of the novels would have been better try my enemy my ally for a very interesting character study of our friend james t the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits and the <UNK> <UNK> subplot seems way out of left field particularly since the subtext in the original series was <UNK> <UNK> br br even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here sorry but it's true
<START> when i heard they were making this i was happy considering the first film was pretty good if a little on the short side br br but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched im looking at you little mermaid 2 br br anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed the best thing about it is the animation is superb it really has that special polish that the proper disney films have br br apart from that the rest is disappointing the storyline is seriously all over the place one moment its about something then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like 3 separate episodes turned into a film br br i laughed perhaps once at the most was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn't funny at all br br stay away from this film unless someone lends it to you for free br br 4 10
<START> i watched the this the other night on a local station because i didn't feel like watching tripe like <UNK> peter <UNK> gives a great performance as a convict named murphy who keeps to himself he admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it his cell is bare of any <UNK> that other inmates have like books and pictures the only time he feels in another zone is in running he does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes when a college coach hears about this he wants to prime him for a shot at the <UNK> at first wants no part of this but when his best friend is killed he shows interest br br this is a good movie period <UNK> is very good what did you expect anything less and michael mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later this movie had that bit of realism probably because it was filmed among <UNK> it almost feels like this was a true story the additional casting is good there is a lot of notable names like brian <UNK> roger e <UNK> and richard <UNK> as well br br my heart <UNK> when some pompous board of directors wouldn't let him run because he didn't feel bad for his crime his final act made me stand up and cheer when they took his dreams away he took them back hard this was back when tv movies were actually good 'the <UNK> <UNK> is a gem of a film <UNK> classic please show this film
<START> career criminal and crime boss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has been on the run for more than 10 years hiding out in <UNK> italy in his absence he has been sentenced to death in his home country of france for his crimes <UNK> with his life in italy and with the police there closing in on him he decides to return to his old <UNK> ground in paris sending his wife <UNK> and two young sons ahead to nice <UNK> and his next in command raymond do one final heist to <UNK> their new lives back in france the heist <UNK> a <UNK> half million <UNK> way less than their sources had suggested despite this and with the police in chase they both make it to nice where they <UNK> briefly after stealing a pleasure boat from a local they aim to make it to san <UNK> a tourist spot where they will blend in more readily but they are stopped by armed customs officers on a deserted beach a shoot out ensues and <UNK> and are both killed a now wounded with two kids in <UNK> is going to be easily spotted by police so he calls on his old friends in paris to send help but they have moved on since their old friend went into hiding and are not too inclined to take a risk themselves so they send small time thief eric stark jean paul <UNK> to rescue him is disgusted that such a <UNK> thief is sent to his aid despite the fact he hits it off immediately with the charming stark he sets out to find out why he has been <UNK> but their betrayal doesn't stop there br br <UNK> aka the big risk was written for the screen by former death row <UNK> and crime writer jose <UNK> le le clan des with <UNK> already on board for the project someone unique to direct the project <UNK> suggested an assistant director that had caught his attention on a previous project one claude <UNK> best known at the time for <UNK> georges on les <UNK> sans <UNK> <UNK> immediately agreed and the rest as they say is history <UNK> crafted a fine gangster film that plays heavily on characters and relationships constantly in hiding has plenty of time to reflect on his life past present and future his friendships that no longer seem to be what he believed they were his now deceased wife and what will become of his two young sons <UNK> as a character actor has always amazed me being both comfortable and convincing in both the police and criminal <UNK> here his world weary performance is sublime and powerful as his world <UNK> all around him as the loneliness and <UNK> of a man on the run kicks in <UNK> former profession as a pro wrestler gets plenty of use as he throws <UNK> <UNK> around with a <UNK> ease <UNK> as stark <UNK> the other storyline within the film that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets on the road trip with his <UNK> charm his coming clean to this woman in danger that he is but a and that the only good thing about me is my left as he knocks out her <UNK> is also a joy to behold as she falls for him anyway <UNK> performance was overlooked at the time as <UNK> a bout de <UNK> was released only three weeks previous godard <UNK> the credit for discovering the new kid on the block his <UNK> within these two films being there for all to see and admire film is a classy affair using plenty of attractive locations the film also has very sparse dialogue <UNK> <UNK> to let the actors do the work with the <UNK> of looks or <UNK> to further the story <UNK> to say this noir fan will be checking out more of work in the future
<START> when i saw the poster at the theater i thought that it is a new line of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try but after i went in i wanted to leave after 20 minutes there was a lot of non sense and logical flaws to me it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters it is not even worth seeing
<START> i fail to understand why you would give this film anything over 4 fair enough it does take me back to the 80s and to the <UNK> old days of horror <UNK> but that genre has not got any better since then it is still so low budget low tech bad acting bad story line not at all scary and not funny enough in fact there is not much good i could say about it the so called monsters are just <UNK> bad i mean we have gone back in time to when they used to make the monsters out of <UNK> and shoot the scenes fame by frame i really fail to understand why someone would <UNK> any money in order to make this script to a film but i guess it might have been almost ok if it had been a bigger budget film br br recommendation would be please do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless if you wish to get <UNK> for a bad halloween make up personally i enjoy independent films and anything outside the box but this just did not do it for me in the least
<START> house calls was an amusing 1978 comedy about a widowed doctor walter matthau who now wants to play the field but can't help but be drawn to a patient of his glenda jackson who refuses to be just another notch on his <UNK> matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit however other complications make it difficult for matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up even though he is clearly in love with the woman matthau and jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from richard benjamin <UNK> dick o'neill and especially art <UNK> as the inept and <UNK> chief of staff at the hospital where matthau is employed matthau even has a brief scene with his real life son charlie who appears as jackson's son this engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years if you've never seen it it's worth the rental
<START> had i known to what i was <UNK> myself i would have <UNK> from the theater the film is dreadful in the literal sense of the word despite striking images intriguing locales and a subject matter that might have been fascinating the film is dead br br i was unfamiliar with this period of greek history and prepared to experience a great film the hand is heavy it is not enough to see a train going by we must watch it from <UNK> we must watch it car by car we must see the smoke we must see it slow down and we must see it stop the director's approach is <UNK> likewise the characters that he creates never develop they never change they are so <UNK> that we wonder are they meant to be <UNK> is there some point to this allegory it is the most pretentious film that i have seen in a long while
<START> i couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish being a fan of movies directed by music video <UNK> i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a <UNK> for the eye to behold there are so many rich full images that are put before me that each and every time that i see this movie i find something new that i had not seen before as with previous movies that i have seen such as blade and mystery men also by former music video directors the use of color to capture one's attention is <UNK> extremely well though the characters could have been developed better the action and <UNK> was well worth the price of admission i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection even if you haven't seen this on the big screen you won't be disappointed i know i wasn't
<START> being a fan of time travel stories i was surprised that there was no <UNK> that sent russell <UNK> character through time he just appeared in <UNK> it was a disappointing part of the episode i enjoyed the premise of the dangers of the future by changing the past other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as no time like the past once upon a time etc were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel perhaps if russell <UNK> character had been the same character he played in execution it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself as sci fi fans know no characters really ever have to in time travel episodes all sorts of plot <UNK> can be applied in these types of stories that was the only flaw i could comment on for this episode
<START> this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think <UNK> la nudity
<START> talk about marketing the poster home video cover of 'the new <UNK> a half naked male in a <UNK> video for those familiar with the gay themed movies  this <UNK> a must see i loved reading one reviewer from another site stating they had been tricked into seeing a movie are you serious the <UNK> itself as the word gay the lord gives you eyes yet you cannot that being said despite the number of gay characters stereotyped no less see the lonely gay the aids victim gay and the <UNK> gay it's more about long term friendship and characters that grow apart in fact if anything there's more here's one for christians to complain about <UNK> couples having sex outside of gasp marriage not to mention <UNK> drinking to excess and drug usage i see this more of a made for tv <UNK> or showtime movie than big screen effort sure i loved the cinematography some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big group of friends that actually act like they've known each other for a million years but we've see this all before nothing really new here barely an original idea  hence bringing back the same i have aids let's deal with that for a good portion of the movie and boy our friend has a serious drug problem but let's not deal with that until it's almost too late that's so us as <UNK> and <UNK> hearts club ' <UNK> the film deals with a group of college buddies now grown in size not minds who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing strangely as in most of these independent movies the most interesting to me at least was the <UNK> set one ben he stole each scene but again there wasn't much to take
<START> a new guard in in the <UNK> truck gig is <UNK> by his co workers to steal <UNK> million from the truck no bad guys so no one will get hurt right of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying man br br i'll admit that i didn't really have any interest in this film but i didn't have any interest in fantastic mr fox either and that film made my top ten of the year <UNK> is even more of a disappointment then i thought it would be as a heist film it fails to deliver the goods it's boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it br br despite this the film somehow has a really great cast but the film doesn't even use this to it's advantage everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices <UNK> short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap matt dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays mr nice guy at first then when things don't go his way he quickly becomes the villain the rest of the impressive cast include lawrence jean reno <UNK> <UNK> fred ward from prison break and milo <UNK> from <UNK> non of them do much and when they actually do something it's without much reasoning behind it br br the film is relatively short but even with it's running time under 90 minutes it felt dragged out how long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere <UNK> did a decent job and it was even more <UNK> the leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic <UNK> million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so the entire plan from my understanding was to drive the <UNK> into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money pretend to get hit and burn the <UNK> they would then walk away with the money of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer the rest of the movie is <UNK> and his crew <UNK> on the doors to get in how very exciting br br the script calls for our hero to have financial problems he might lose his house which would in turn make him lose his brother you see both their parents died and it's just the two of them looking out for each other so now he has a reason to join the heist at first he didn't want in but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things how convenient br br whole spin on the heist genre is that it's from an <UNK> truck from the guys who drive it after that basic premise the film falls flat on it's face i found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke speaking of the ending it sucks br br skip it
<START> extremely funny more gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of friends and with a good ie funny not the <UNK> only casted <UNK> simpson in the movies when will these episodes emerge on dvd
<START> this is a gem as a film four production the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping it's long yet horrifying to the point it's excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story <UNK> most <UNK> aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and <UNK> from showing the <UNK> sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didn't stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that <UNK> me after seeing this very well made documentary
<START> this is one of those films that for whatever reason just <UNK> with me everything about it is right eric roberts <UNK> nice investigator his <UNK> narration the <UNK> plot dan <UNK> and denis given good roles the settings the paintings in the artist studio scenes the end credit sequence and the wonderfully haunting theme music that perfectly <UNK> the mood of the whole film if i have any <UNK> it is about beverly <UNK> as the femme fatale but she plays her final scenes beautifully i think that director matthew <UNK> was trying for a sort of feel to the whole thing it didnt work but as a murder mystery its a gem
<START> without doubt this is the worst movie i've ever seen br br poor acting poor script poor direction and poor production br br why did they even bother this entire movie was total nonsense suspension of disbelief can only carry so far but this pushes the limits completely br br for a movie with no humour content the audience laughed <UNK> often
<START> i love this movie br br this beautiful charming love story drew me in immediately with its lovable characters and heart warming romance i became so attached to the characters throughout the film that i felt as if i knew them personally the storyline is very enchanting and it brought me to tears in several touching moments duchovny and driver have a very cute <UNK> relationship that you can't help getting involved in this one's worth watching more than once and showing to all your friends i'm just curious why wasn't this a big hit br br i give this a 10 out of 10 spectacular film and this is coming from a guy who thinks that 9 out of 10 movies aren't even worth watching
<START> victor was quite the master in this film having starred in it directed it and even wrote the screenplay that's pretty amazing while today few have any idea who was he might be familiar to <UNK> bergman fans as the star one of <UNK> most acclaimed films wild <UNK> br br as far as this film goes it's a very mixed bag on one hand you have to respect it because for <UNK> it's a very good film the idea of the grim <UNK> sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative plus the special effect of the phantom <UNK> is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well crafted film on the other hand it's an amazingly dated and preachy film more like something you'd expect to be shown in sunday school instead of in an honest to goodness theater plus some of the story elements just don't make sense instead of coming off as dedicated or good the dying salvation army worker seems like a <UNK> a very sad and confusing <UNK> why is she in love with this man am i missing something br br so my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with <UNK> like me then by all means watch it but if you aren't a silent fan this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated
<START> there is nothing at all redeeming about this film it is very bad and not in such a way that it is even remotely funny horrible plot acting and writing and incredibly cheap production values to boot this film makes the look like a work of art
<START> this was a movie that at the end i thought now that was an enjoyable 2 hours i hate spending around 20 not including baby sitting for my husband and myself to have that it was ok feeling br br i think i like will smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero he was well cast in this his character was very likable as was kevin <UNK> br br there were several laugh out loud scenes it's also a romantic movie so guys if you want to impress the lady in your life take her to this women will like it as much as any chick flick but i wouldn't <UNK> this as one there is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy i think that's one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie it has romance and slapstick i don't usually like slapstick that much but it wasn't overdone and i can't think of any those scenes that didn't deliver laughs br br i definitely recommend this movie the first thing my husband said to me after it was over was i want to see it again
<START> i just saw this movie in a sneak preview and before reading my comment you have to know that it is very <UNK> because i love <UNK> <UNK> club house and music like that br br the movie deals with carl whose brother jason or whatever his name was died in an accident he fell off a <UNK> drunk carl meets his brother's girlfriend sunny and the two of them quite <UNK> some kind of private investigation about <UNK> death and carl gets involved in <UNK> ex life that was filled with <UNK> and drugs the movie itself seen from an artistic point of view is nothing more than a big pile of s t the plot is predictable all of the characters are extremely cliched and two dimensional stupid boy from a small town young good looking innocent girl big bad drug king the list is endless and most of the acting such as the plot are just not credible matthew <UNK> performance of the stupid boy coming to big london and sudden taking drugs from people he does not even know does not seem very credible unlike his female counterpart sunny performed by <UNK> whose behaviour seems more realistic to the <UNK> nothing more than a joke was tim performance of the drug king <UNK> a phony caricature too <UNK> and just too ridiculous to be true br br but if you like club music the club scenes such as the selected tracks are simply brilliant if you enjoy a simple with a sweet girl like sunny yes i confess i lost my heart that makes my comment even more <UNK> i guess with some predictable twists and turns you will <UNK> enjoy this movie br br anybody else f o r g e t i t br br 3 out of 10 objective view br br 7 out of 10 my personal view and also my final vote
<START> the video box for says starring second generation <UNK> and one can't help but feel sad granted <UNK> griffith has gone on to bigger and better things but who cares about the rest of the cast so with that being the pathetic attention <UNK> on the box i was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking i would be in the land of <UNK> bad they're good 70's <UNK> eh not so much while so many <UNK> 70's youth films or plain ol' 70's films for that matter tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful doesn't even try it's just <UNK> it is devoid of any interest whatsoever each character is so poorly conceived that it's no wonder these actors look so <UNK> br br in a nutshell the movie is about three 20 somethings who go to <UNK> to start a business but instead get robbed and then have to find work they get beat up eat dog food steal cars rob banks it's all very typical but on top of that it's executed in the most mundane way possible there are no surprises and the flow is so bad and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all br br but if you're a fan of <UNK> <UNK> breasts then this is a must see that's still not enough to get this above the lowest rating i can give br br best line jesus everything is <UNK> with you out of
<START> it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it <UNK> into a direction less mess who is the main character is this a serious film or some <UNK> <UNK> esquire over the top goofy film is this a <UNK> documentary with moments of dialog inserted i have no clue i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end i kept thinking there would be some big shocker <UNK> which never came i cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast <UNK> through the pointless <UNK> scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the have i got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was <UNK> the realities of that group of friends <UNK> felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage <UNK> which larry didn't write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously <UNK> <UNK> was just plain bad
<START> i've been waiting 30 years to see this film i played the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my <UNK> recently i located a reasonably <UNK> and i watched it this morning it was in widescreen probably even a <UNK> print <UNK> the colors were quite good very little <UNK> certainly not <UNK> but i'm very very happy with this clean copy br br now for the film it's pretty good i wouldn't say it's great though there are great scenes in it perhaps may not have been the right director for it but i'll say this for me the center piece of the film was the <UNK> scene <UNK> staged by one of the great weather scenes of all time br br in fact i'd go as far to say that the acting scenes are better than the musical scenes not that the musical sequences are bad not at all they did lack something though perhaps it was the fact that there are no close ups and very few medium shots it was almost like watching a filming of a stage production perhaps that was the feel that was going after in the end it may not have been the right choice but so it goes it is far from a ruined movie br br having said that not everyone loves the singers on the soundtrack either i always have they are perfect for this film i love the singing voices the actors lip sinking are excellent for the most part i just wish the songs were staged more <UNK> life's two numbers are fine but the intimate numbers don't even feel intimate they just feel far away in spite of that you cannot deny the power of the music and in the end that is what comes through loud and clear once again maybe what was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he was working with i believe he had the right idea but perhaps went too far in that direction br br the acting is terrific top kudos goes to the great <UNK> peters who acts and sings the part of crown he is the ultimate we just want him to leave poor <UNK> alone and he doesn't as proud arrogant and nasty as he is sammy davis <UNK> classic rendition of life is the slick devil himself and a very charismatic one at that arguably <UNK> best film acting poor <UNK> just can't handle two bad men i'm glad the <UNK> pan gave davis a tap dance number to do br br <UNK> and <UNK> reportedly not impressed by being in the film really are very sweet together i don't know about chemistry there was more chemistry between <UNK> and peters than there was between <UNK> and <UNK> still it worked out fine for dorothy and sidney br br even so i think they should both be proud of the work they did on this film they both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye their characterizations where very 3d and believable sidney <UNK> however seems almost out of place in <UNK> row i couldn't help thinking he was mr in to sir with love very educated and well mannered and spoken fallen on hard times he probably wouldn't have been my first choice for the part of but hey he was a huge star at the time so why not <UNK> <UNK> was as perfect as her carmen jones in fact even more vulnerable this time around carmen was probably the <UNK> part for her to do br br a very very good film indeed it is two sticks short of what i would call a classic it just doesn't make the ultimate classic grade still there is no reason on earth why the gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful film even with all of its flaws hidden from the public as they have may have made some odd choices as a director but the film is nothing to be ashamed and embarrassed about for anyone involved with it it is what it is and there are a lot worse movies than this that are embarrassing out on dvd and in theaters today and <UNK> is not one of them
<START> the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful br br this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen first of all is the plot a very thin plot wont comment further on this part and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following this makes the movie so bad because you know whats going to happen secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed one of the questions and this is no spoiler is what the hell are the kids doing in that corn <UNK> is the characters very bad not only because the movie is bad but also because of the sorry actors they are bad as they can be br br the last thing that make this movie bad is that its a horror movie you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks but you are not scared you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen br br conclusion the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad the actors are bad the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary the movie is best unseen
<START> oh yawn not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered the only difference is that in this film everybody's a pig or has <UNK> for brains i hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit is that a more <UNK> act than his abuse and this movie shows all the <UNK> <UNK> of bad writing i saw it on the <UNK> best of britain series if this is <UNK> best no wonder the british film industry is in trouble br br the only bright spot in this film was david <UNK> he plays his character as so despicable that i'm likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a scottish accent kate tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as <UNK> <UNK> as david character they deserve each other br br in the <UNK> for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic brendan english policemen are made out to be so incompetent that they're <UNK> to give out traffic tickets the british <UNK> union should sue the makers of this film for <UNK> br br this film isn't worth the electricity it takes to run your dvd to watch it
<START> how can any of you call this propaganda a family film this is nothing but a pc <UNK> insult to small town <UNK> the film portrays a woman as the great white <UNK> of some small <UNK> town and everyone else in the town mostly men are just mere <UNK> in distress incapable of honor who can't <UNK> for themselves and have to rely on the main character for redemption this film is just some love affair that the producer has with some <UNK> arrogant <UNK> little <UNK> who he expects the audience to admire br br the person who made this movie probably spent his whole life in a <UNK> sensitive church and had the freedom to dump garbage on small church members as wacky <UNK> and not the majority the same people who give money to the salvation army at <UNK> collecting <UNK> to help <UNK> the poor and the homeless singing fellow <UNK> and making friends with each other what is wrong with this humble group that <UNK> these self righteous <UNK> most christians in this world would step in front of a train and give their lives for any person in trouble even if they disagree with them most christians wouldn't mind if the <UNK> or some church worker of some church took of his or her coat or outer shirt they would not <UNK> her this film is ridiculous
<START> i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival world premiere br br a haunting intimate portrait of loneliness and the <UNK> of letting it grow and turn into something darker br br the acting of the two leads jessica richard <UNK> is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged br br reminded me in theme of the works of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and raymond <UNK> where i'm calling from br br the soundtrack jo crooked fingers is excellent and <UNK> moments in the film without drawing attention to itself br br highly recommend the film and the soundtrack
<START> an italian american co production co starring linda blair and david 'the <UNK> <UNK> how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat br br well based on the <UNK> extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so i would have said <UNK> <UNK> thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a <UNK> of nudity too unfortunately my copy was <UNK> edited to remove such offensive material br br the <UNK> stars as gary a photographer who <UNK> his beautiful girlfriend leslie leslie <UNK> to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by <UNK> leslie of her virginity br br his plans for <UNK> are <UNK> however by the unexpected arrival of property <UNK> <UNK> and rose brooks robert <UNK> and annie ross their pregnant daughter jane blair son tommy michael <UNK> pretty <UNK> architect linda sullivan catherine <UNK> and estate agent jerry rick farnsworth who have come to <UNK> the <UNK> hotel br br after explaining their unexpected presence on the island gary and leslie are welcomed by the <UNK> new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it <UNK> to return to the <UNK> everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building unfortunately <UNK> to the <UNK> new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch <UNK> <UNK> who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life one by one victims are pulled into a <UNK> red <UNK> which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate br br none of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious <UNK> as tommy is particularly bad whilst <UNK> proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore rose has her lips <UNK> together before being <UNK> alive in a <UNK> jerry is <UNK> and burnt alive linda is tortured by <UNK> and <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> of blood and gary gets stabbed in the back br br oh and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed again
<START> the perfect 6 step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie br br 1 take one burnt out rogue ex cop with a bad attitude yet a sensitive touch as well closet concert <UNK> with a pet cat br br 2 add some cool retro <UNK> like a beat up <UNK> <UNK> a roaring bike a heavily <UNK> leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles br br 3 mix in a couple of free spirit locations e g a trendy sea side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office br br 4 spice it up with deep <UNK> romantic themes such as a post divorce traumatized but finally <UNK> ex wife a secretly <UNK> and therefore <UNK> waitress a pair of former colleague cops only one of whom is really a complete jerk and a best buddy getting <UNK> over a <UNK> full of illegal br br 5 let it <UNK> for about 90 minutes in a fast paced though not necessarily logical or <UNK> consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes cheap tender moments and <UNK> wise cracks br br 6 serve with either a comfortable <UNK> to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting don't worry even the yellow pages will do
<START> we've seen a story like this before a wife in marital troubles played by <UNK> kinski <UNK> in sex with a stranger william baldwin and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job everything seems bright however kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants what to do say nothing br br i didn't really like the movie while it wasn't just bad it clearly lacked that something maybe it should've focused more on what's going inside <UNK> head nothing to say about the actors themselves i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films finally the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot br br in my opinion the movie tried to look cool it had a bit of shaky <UNK> here and there some stills fast cuts and <UNK> but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better same goes for the music otherwise it didn't look that bad br br some might like this but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea to be fair i don't usually watch much this type of thrillers this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long i think it could've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes especially the shower scene br br my advice try before you buy
<START> buddy holly was a <UNK> and victim of the early days of rock <UNK> roll the young singer <UNK> from texas left his mark on the <UNK> of modern music inspired by elvis <UNK> holly would spend a lot of time fighting the system in order to get his rock a billy sound recorded before his <UNK> death he was mixing lush strings with be <UNK> <UNK> holly would take his place with <UNK> chuck <UNK> jerry lee lewis and ricky nelson as the voices of teenage angst br br this easy to watch bio is not without flaws some situations events places and even names were not correct for various reasons what makes this movie so believable is that gary busey did his own singing in the part of holly a well produced soundtrack became a multi million <UNK> br br busey was nominated for an oscar other stars of note are don <UNK> conrad <UNK> charles martin smith and maria
<START> i like the phrase british post war suburban paranoia that one of the reviewers used it describes so well the kind of films john mills <UNK> in the october man <UNK> the long memory <UNK> in between big pictures scott of the <UNK> 1948 and war and peace 1956 br br this distinctly eric style plot had john mills playing dr howard who promises his friend charles unseen to meet a visiting german actress <UNK> lisa at the airport a creepy reporter jeffrey <UNK> lionel <UNK> is in his <UNK> rooms at the time and offers to give him a lift but while he is tracking the actress down <UNK> informs him she is already in the car waiting something <UNK> is going on howard is dropped off for his date and thinks no more about it br br the next night he finds her body when he arrives home from work further more he finds his friend charles could not have <UNK> him as he is still in new york and <UNK> doesn't seem to exist earlier on a patient mrs <UNK> ray who has been referred to him by doctor george <UNK> <UNK> tells of her recurring dream about finding a dead body and a <UNK> <UNK> with a square base it is a nightmare that is coming true for howard but of course when detective inspector <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> interviews her she <UNK> all knowledge of the conversation the <UNK> is later found in the boot of <UNK> br br when howard is lying low robert brady <UNK> hyde white visits him he calls himself a friend he has a photo of <UNK> that he wants to trade for a box of matches <UNK> gave howard at the airport howard returns to the flat charles rings and while howard is on the phone an unknown <UNK> knocks him out and steals the matches who can he trust who hasn't something to hide br br this is a top thriller not quite in the same class as the october man but with john mills doing what he does best playing ordinary men caught up in impossible mysteries br br highly recommended
<START> i'd read all the negative reviews for anna christie you know the <UNK> about the static camera out dated acting and <UNK> of the screenplay but when i viewed it yesterday i found it remarkably affecting and enjoyable yep clarence <UNK> camera remains <UNK> for the most part and i'm pretty sure one of the <UNK> was <UNK> in the <UNK> light yep there's a lot of dialogue and no spectacular action sequences it's an early <UNK> with primitive technical aspects but then there's garbo marie <UNK> george f marion and charles <UNK> all proving that great acting is timeless br br i believe anna christie is still one of <UNK> most iconic performances and it's a wonderful performance from the divine one in a role that is really quite <UNK> for her yes we've seen garbo weary and almost beaten yet never with <UNK> under her eyes or her knocking back shots of <UNK> garbo played so many delightful costume roles that to see her play a contemporary woman is fascinating she's not <UNK> down by heavy dresses or make up this performance seems quite raw from garbo br br the plot from the o'neill play follows weary swedish ex prostitute anna and her reunion with her <UNK> <UNK> father <UNK> had enough trouble for any girl of twenty as she tells drunken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a bar she finds <UNK> in a life at sea and romance with a rough <UNK> but good hearted <UNK> charles <UNK> but her past threatens to ruin it all br br charles <UNK> is overlooked in <UNK> long line of largely inferior leading men he's one actor who can actually share the screen with her and not get <UNK> up by her magical presence the pair have great chemistry together and seemed to enjoy working with one another <UNK> can never be accused of <UNK> and once again the grand dame is up to her old tricks but she's terrific and convincing in her role never annoying as in the dreadful dinner at eight i've never really heard of george f marion before but he was wonderful as <UNK> father br br this is pre code and rather gritty and dark by <UNK> standards i really enjoyed it and while it may <UNK> in some places it's still wonderful
<START> after 30 years of <UNK> once again i <UNK> myself in the <UNK> of uplifting melancholy the cold slow paced and existential treatment of this crime story comes from a different world <UNK> world where darkness is pure enlightenment
<START> death promise is a lost 70's exploitation gem and deserves to be seen technically somewhat of a mess and <UNK> a stock of amateur new <UNK> types this film never <UNK> i highly recommend tracking this down it's a hoot and a half
<START> a very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie through the sport of <UNK> as a mean a high school <UNK> coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle on and off the field br br the acting and directing are good the <UNK> shots are just ok if you know some <UNK> or really cool if don't know much about it br br i recommend this movie worth watching especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more every day br br the plot is based on a true story taking place in <UNK> the coach portrayed in this movie has been at the <UNK> of the <UNK> for over 30 years and <UNK> only game every 3 years br br enjoy
<START> when i first saw this movie i also expected our boys to be cute and more like an extended version of the tv show i didn't get it back then but years later at a party years later at a <UNK> type par <UNK> where certain <UNK> had been <UNK> <UNK> and with plenty of <UNK> head was on late at night we watched it and finally realized what head was all about it <UNK> their own show as shown in one song that called themselves a <UNK> image as <UNK> jones wrote in his they made a monkey out of me he openly admits that everyone in the film had been up all night smoking <UNK> they made fun of themselves society everything great film tho as a <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> i no longer i still watch this film when i want a good lol
<START> when a <UNK> <UNK> is rejected from a <UNK> country club he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from <UNK> <UNK> chevy chase and turns it into a theme park golf course in which everyone can join br br this is by no means a good movie but it is still slightly amusing at times almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as <UNK> <UNK> for a second time and plays it great he is not only the funniest character in the movie he is the only funny character in the movie even dan <UNK> fails to bring humor to this film which <UNK> to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to <UNK> with others shown on comedy central the movie might have been better if <UNK> <UNK> chase had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason who they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie overall <UNK> ii is humorous but a large mistake br br i do not recommend this movie
<START> what is the deal with all these ethnic crime groups <UNK> italian mafia related movies we all know the godfather as in don <UNK> <UNK> now we have this mexican one which is just a <UNK> out copy i cant see why other ethnic groups have to <UNK> and imitate italian <UNK> but it sure makes them look silly they sure seem to be italians i would much prefer to see <UNK> perform there own ideas and like to see there own culture and the way they do it instead of <UNK> ideas from the godfather trilogy apart from that the movie was disappointing seeing <UNK> acting and trying to be italians is not my thing after watching this i'm now going to watch the real godfather so this movie can be <UNK> from my memory
<START> the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the jewish experience in the united states other than <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which dealt with anti <UNK> they usually had a musical theatre background these films included the <UNK> story 1946 <UNK> sings again 1949 the eddy story 1951 the eddie <UNK> story 1953 the benny goodman story 1956 and <UNK> 1958 the leading actors in these jewish films were always played by non jews for example larry parks a non jew played al <UNK> and gene kelly played <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme <UNK> to a mainly non jewish audience the jazz singer <UNK> is no different danny thomas was a <UNK> catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non practicing in the film the clue to her background is when she <UNK> the family meal before entering she says i haven't been to a service since i left home br br the film is about a son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea his dilemma is whether to become a <UNK> a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father br br however there is much more to this film than this this film was made after the <UNK> trial during the mccarthy and the hollywood <UNK> therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens and br br are american the <UNK> choir would rather play baseball than practice the friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league <UNK> the <UNK> itself dates back to and george washington is said to have visited therefore jews are presented as part and <UNK> of american society nobody in this film has a eastern european accent peggy lee appeared in very few feature films in this film you get to see her sing lover and just one of those things wonderful danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well the comedic routines could have been left out yes the film is <UNK> and sentimental but it is well worth seeing i enjoyed it very much
<START> the toxic <UNK> br br the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a <UNK> and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste mutated into a superhero that is completely <UNK> sounded ok even for 1985 this movie is listed as a horror i even have read of a cult following with this series br br now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldn't stop watching the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this movie br br drug dealing <UNK> godzilla entrance i'm all for movies that promote anti drugs heck i even like godzilla and well <UNK> i'm not into it but even still i think that the heights of <UNK> would love to give this movie the 1000 hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie br br personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the or so of my life back br br to me 1 out of 10 is too high it's too bad that there isn't a 0 zero or even negative to place on a movie here br br in other words this movie is j u n k would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive <UNK> then have to watch this movie ever again i would be the first person that would use not only the <UNK> of this movie as <UNK> but i would be up for a movie and script burning
<START> apparently this movie was based on a true story i'm not sure how accurate it is though but it really reminded me of how when i see that someone has been murdered on the news it's amazing how much it doesn't affect me sure i think it's terrible but i honestly don't care i move on it seems that murder is trivial now this is what <UNK> edge shows nobody really seems to care about this girl and her death not even the killer then what's the point br br the killer in this story is john and for the large amount of the movie he hides out with another killer named played by dennis hopper is older and you can see the <UNK> gap he says he loved the girl that he killed when he asks john if he loved the girl he killed he simply replies she was okay the movie only seems to offer one solution life is more important than death a character's life is <UNK> people get second chances and one hopeless case is killed br br the acting is really good after watching this movie i could only come to the conclusion that <UNK> glover is either a brilliant actor or a terrible actor i still have no idea he was my main reason to see this movie though but the best performance is clearly given by dennis hopper br br even though the fashion is really 80's and characters sometimes mention then current issues i still think <UNK> edge is as relevant today as ever br br my rating 10 10
<START> the narrative was clear and <UNK> but overall the film never caught my interest scenes felt flat and uninspired khan historically speaking had a very interesting epic life but the film failed to capture that instead focused on small <UNK> as a youth and a love story i think i've seen disguised in a slew of other films i never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan <UNK> killing and double crossing his way to the top the one redeeming quality was the photography the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film unfortunately combined with the <UNK> of the story i left <UNK> and disappointed
<START> this is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film the direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and patrick is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body br br spy vs spy films are not or should not be about car chases and shootings the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range br br even the action shots are just a cliché with the usual <UNK> <UNK> and crashing through tables and <UNK> yawn br br i got half way through and switched off completely bored
<START> i try to be diverse in my movie watching i can get into pride and prejudice as easily as i get into disappearing acts love jones is my all time favorite it is the standard by which i judge any modern urban romantic comedy shot very well the shot of and darius riding up <UNK> drive on the motorcycle is one of classic 3 second movie shots of all time of course no one will ever remember it when it came out i though it would be a new <UNK> for modern urban film making good actors no guns and so forth the movie industry has disappointed me to a certain degree you will have your occasional <UNK> or roll <UNK> or tyler <UNK> why did i get married so whenever i need to see my people presented on screen in a very professional and stylish way i pop in love jones there is no best movie ever made to many people and opinions for that but it is my personal best my favorite line from love jones baby i just wanna come up and talk
<START> this is supposed to be based on <UNK> <UNK> the woman in white but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters' names the time period and the settings if they were going to change the story so thoroughly i don't understand why they needed to keep up the <UNK> that it came from <UNK> collins go read the book it's much better
<START> i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema in the past couple of years it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity <UNK> was not an exception i wasn't expecting much when i went in to see the movie the book was ridiculous and the saying the book is always better than the movie did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison br br usually when i see a terrible movie i find myself more amused than anything else sadly though i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that <UNK> is the movie was filmed with promise i guess it had anthony hopkins <UNK> moore and gary <UNK> and for directing there was <UNK> scott there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained it was pathetic the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it what's worse is that the book was even <UNK> and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included which is sad in the case of a movie where br br spoiler ahead br br ray <UNK> brain was being <UNK> in pieces that scene more than any other made me want to cry because it <UNK> its predecessor to such a monumental level silence of the <UNK> was one of my favorite films of all time but <UNK> was a two hour plus joke this movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie
<START> the biggest heroes is one of the greatest movies ever a good story great actors and a brilliant ending is what makes this film the jumping start of the director thomas great <UNK>
<START> it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to <UNK> their <UNK> sloppy <UNK> of films like sergio <UNK> <UNK> upon a time in <UNK> the <UNK> history of this <UNK> film and the grand <UNK> myth associated with it's production and many versions <UNK> its mediocrity on a narrative level the film <UNK> <UNK> and forward in fits and starts its central figures <UNK> and seemingly out of place surrounded by the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> sets the <UNK> of production detail and the by 1984 <UNK> but gorgeous cinematographic <UNK> on offer to the audience the <UNK> time frame is confusing <UNK> and <UNK> leading some critics to imagine the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to be the <UNK> of some future <UNK> <UNK> as well as the <UNK> toned this ham handed overly fan boy <UNK> interpretation <UNK> over the glaring narrative <UNK> on display even at this full running time figures appear and disappear with <UNK> <UNK> the deborah character is <UNK> established in child form a cold and <UNK> female not even <UNK> at the gravity with which she will re establish her relationship with a post prison <UNK> the said re union <UNK> rings completely false the <UNK> pace is somewhat to blame certain sequences drag along for far too long <UNK> very little <UNK> at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels <UNK> to <UNK> every <UNK> of screen time possible in order to show off his production fatal for a film that contains figures so <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> of the lives is presented to us as a <UNK> <UNK> the historical <UNK> of america's teens through <UNK> and its <UNK> ending with the <UNK> ruin of its <UNK> central figures save deborah a make up department <UNK> or intentional one wonders this notion is <UNK> even banal the cast of characters as imagined in the one note script written by seven italians no less are <UNK> and <UNK> played by all but the younger actors who at least venture a few <UNK> facial expressions this is understandable given the almost <UNK> material some critics state that the characters may seem so self absorbed but <UNK> seek their own goals assuming the <UNK> of others e g when <UNK> gets out of prison max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming <UNK> will <UNK> this explanation of their abrupt <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films <UNK> supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense although <UNK> <UNK> score is much <UNK> it is undeniably <UNK> and repetitive it <UNK> with an emotional that the scenes themselves many violent just do not warrant at points it is questionable whether or not <UNK> was watching the same film i was so <UNK> is his work as a <UNK> to american filmmaking it succeeds in terms of mood helped by a few <UNK> of masterful editing <UNK> between time periods and visuals not helped by said score but lacks narrative <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> vs <UNK> starts as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jerry ryan ryan his girlfriend carrie <UNK> <UNK> hire captain michael <UNK> executive producer michael <UNK> to take them to an island in the south pacific at first <UNK> is reluctant since the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes his mind when a load of cash is offered along with tv news reporter sandra <UNK> <UNK> they set <UNK> for the island once <UNK> find out that the military have been funding illegal <UNK> genetic experiments which have resulted in huge <UNK> <UNK> king that have eaten almost every other living thing there <UNK> co are next on the menu br br co written directed by the ever awful jim <UNK> under his jay andrews <UNK> this is just plain awful this is just plain hard to sit through is even worse than the usual rubbish <UNK> <UNK> the sci fi channel have the nerve to air if that's possible the script is terrible predictable utterly boring some giant monsters of some sort are created by scientists messing around with <UNK> a group of people are trapped with said monsters have to try to escape being eaten that's it that's the whole plot of <UNK> vs <UNK> maybe this was trying to rip off alien vs predator 2004 with the title but all the ' bit amounts to is a rubbish thirty second stand off between the two titular <UNK> at the very end boring as hell surely a big disappointment to anyone hoping to have a full on monster mash the character's are poor the dialogue is awful the pace is slow the story is predictable cliché ridden the whole film just sucks really with a lazy script that states wrongly that both <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> which they are not hell <UNK> vs <UNK> isn't even worth watching for any unintentional laughs since it's so dull hardly anything ever happens although the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the <UNK> is quite funny for the wrong reasons br br how does <UNK> keep getting directing jobs he is probably consistently the worst director currently working how can he keep getting fun sounding films set on beautiful locations with half decent casts still <UNK> out such an awful film i think this was cut to get a pg or for it's tv showing since every time someone <UNK> it's masked by a parrot <UNK> there's zero gore or violence the monster scenes are limp people just sort of stand there the monsters just sort of stands there too <UNK> or roaring that's about it the cgi computer effects are terrible this is really poor stuff that just looks horrible br br with a supposed budget of about <UNK> 000 this looks as cheap as it was the <UNK> locations are nice to look at but that's about it the acting is poor from an <UNK> looking cast br br <UNK> vs <UNK> is an absolutely terrible sci fi channel <UNK> <UNK> from jim <UNK> films don't get much worse than this
<START> having long <UNK> network television programming i remember the first time i caught an episode of police squad it was totally by accident it was during the show's initial network run on abc in early 1982 i am a <UNK> channel <UNK> and was flipping the <UNK> one evening when suddenly appeared police squad 's opening credit sequence on my tv screen i immediately recognized it as a <UNK> of the opening credits of m squad starring lee marvin one of my all time favorite cop shows i stopped surfing then of course came <UNK> getting shot up followed by the immortal rex hamilton as abraham lincoln by now i was saying to myself what the heck is this then came special guest star <UNK> <UNK> brown getting <UNK> by a <UNK> safe i was hooked from that moment the episode was ring of fear a dangerous assignment with its comic references to on the <UNK> and <UNK> ali but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non <UNK> leslie <UNK> and alan north in their loose parody of lee marvin and paul of m squad were an absolute riot finally i said to myself a network television program truly worth watching wouldn't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later leave it to the networks i should have known anyway i just bought the dvd collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago the naked gun movies were terrific as well but i really missed alan north he was so good as ed peter <UNK> as what were they thinking casting <UNK> in that part and especially william johnny the guy great stuff
<START> i have seen this play many times from olivier to branagh and this remains the one version that always stands out in my memory many actors have captured aspects of this character but for me it is always derek <UNK> performance they are compared to and all others just come up a bit short
<START> i must have been around ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the drive in at the circle drive in in long beach the title was hammer of god from which i can never forget for some reason but what i do remember are the different scenes that have left an <UNK> on my mind forever br br my brother always reminds me of the movie although it has been forever it seems since we seen the movie from time to time the years i would look for it at the rental stores and from time to time i would check on the web and for some reason it appears like it is never available or no one knows what movie i'm talking about br br if i only knew if and were it was available i would love to purchase that movie if anyone is aware of its <UNK> please inform me
<START> this is a title in search of a movie it's a pitch that sounded <UNK> to some studio executive and the rest be damned when this film was made there were still two things that cgi did not do at all well people and fur <UNK> people were thus not destined to look good when rendered by computer this is the only example i can think of where effects for a well <UNK> sequel took a giant leap back landing well behind those of the original movie for the record the design of the werewolves doesn't help a bit the film makers apparently couldn't decide between <UNK> and tried to do both and wound up with a creature that looks equally awkward either way the <UNK> are <UNK> nonsensical and the end result with a relatively high <UNK> and short <UNK> looks like a cross between ron <UNK> and a <UNK> but back to the crass part this is a movie which exists purely to cash in on its i am not a fan of original film but boy does it look good in light of this if you thought some of humor was forced try some of the excruciating attempts here the bubble <UNK> scene the corpse humor the dog that you know you'll just have to watch that bit yourselves thomas everett scott is on vacation in europe with friends and decides to take a break from acting the ugly and jump off the <UNK> tower in the middle of the night this leads to him <UNK> a young woman <UNK> julie it's not worth this just to become a star in america ask <UNK> <UNK> from jumping to her death she turns out to be part of a cult of werewolves who are plotting to i'm not sure something bad ghastly french stereotypes <UNK> plot holes a muddled ending no matter the studio cared only that the title would likely fool millions of american werewolf in london fans into <UNK> over their cash for the most part happy to say they were wrong
<START> not having seen this film in quite some time we caught with it not long ago in the nicely transferred <UNK> dvd le <UNK> is a film that owes a lot to other movies as it keeps reminding us about <UNK> the <UNK> jungle among others because they all deal with <UNK> that take center stage in the movie and <UNK> it in great detail unfortunately one knows that old <UNK> that crime does not pay and from the start these men involved in it are doomed from the <UNK> br br jean pierre <UNK> was a director of few words he didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialog as it's the case here yet for not being talky they had a style of their own as proved with le le samurai and his masterpiece bob le among others mr <UNK> had a sense of style that comes across in everything he did in this film working with his cinematographer <UNK> he takes us along for a ride through the streets of paris that shows the vibrant city mainly at night and the bleak winter in france the score is by eric that <UNK> a <UNK> music that <UNK> most of the action br br although the film shows <UNK> <UNK> as corey at the center of the action it is however the smart inspector mattei who is the real hero of the movie as played by the great he is a man that shows a lot of patience because he has figured from the beginning how to catch <UNK> and in the process he gets involved in the investigation of the jewel heist in which he knows the escaped man he is <UNK> <UNK> large behind it gives an enormously satisfying performance as mattei showing equal parts of determination and <UNK> as it's the case with the three cats he <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> always <UNK> with interesting performances his appearances in pictures in here he is corey the man who is first seen leaving prison and promising himself he won't go back but he cannot pass a good thing when he decides to go ahead and participate in the robbery his association with <UNK> and <UNK> pays off in the way they get the job done but it will also prove a mistake in the way they will not be able to <UNK> of the <UNK> as the fence they have relied on has a change of heart br br <UNK> maria and <UNK> <UNK> are seen as <UNK> and <UNK> respectively they were excellent actors who blend well in the action of the film both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and it shows mr <UNK> has the more complex character to play as we witness him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons inside his head br br jean pierre got wonderful results from his cast and crew in a film that although feels a bit longer but still succeeds in showing his style in one of the most memorable pictures from the director
<START> if you can stomach the <UNK> this movie should make you laugh out loud several times it did for me at least i'll only mention one of my favorite elements the underwater shots of the fish swimming the sound which <UNK> those shots is great too br br one last note william <UNK> is actually a pretty decent actor i hope he gets another day in the sun watching him as the greatest american hero was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago and he hasn't been very visible since he seemed kind of depressed in this movie somebody give him a fun job on a good show or something
<START> <UNK> are very interesting some go out with a bang lord of the rings some get <UNK> weaker the matrix some get lost in obscurity blade back to the future but some maintain the genius that seemingly ever growing bright light that <UNK> beyond the surface of its flawless exterior case and point three colors trilogy this chapter in the trilogy being the last one is the most philosophical and thought provoking in blue we had a more visually stunning more character driven plot in white it was more of a light hearted narrative driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything red however is focused on the what <UNK> and how comes it questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present br br this chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner she soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his phone calls through advanced <UNK> equipment all three films in the <UNK> have very basic plot lines but bring a lot more to the story consider in blue the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones we are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary french society and how that reflects the character's behavior red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life but it is also about chance hope and fate br br irene <UNK> stars as valentine who at first finds the old man jean louis <UNK> whom we never find the name of extremely self centered and disgusting though through self <UNK> analysis and her <UNK> intentions she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her if only he was 40 years younger irene lives across from another younger judge who highly resembles the old man this is the what if that keeps <UNK> in the movie what if irene were born 40 years ago the old man would have been her perfect match but what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match since he so closely resembles the older one valentine doesn't know this only we do and <UNK> subtly suggests this in almost every frame which irene is in we are constantly <UNK> in the face with his presence as almost a suggestion of fate br br i mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason that reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story we are to compare the old judge to <UNK> jean pierre the younger judge in more than one way we learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away in another scene we see <UNK> <UNK> as the love of his life gets away with another man there are constant <UNK> of whether or not valentine will ever meet this man even though they pass each other without <UNK> every single day there is also the <UNK> of the <UNK> to valentine it is a way of keeping sane and <UNK> her life to <UNK> it is what leads to his <UNK> and to the old man it is the only thing he has left these three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology it is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are br br all three colors films stand for a certain principle most common in france blue stands for liberty the personal being white stands for <UNK> being accepted by more than one and red is <UNK> to <UNK> to learn and although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the <UNK> principle <UNK> makes sure he brings in the other two as well in order to connect all three stories for example we see the old man trying to reach out to valentine and <UNK> her with his spy equipment which is a reflection of the <UNK> principle we also see near the end that valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others not picking up the phone when michel calls a clear example of liberty and with all three principles established <UNK> nicely <UNK> all of the characters as well in the final and most heartfelt scene br br red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger it is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone and whether or not one person can change your life the final chapter in the most awe inspiring trilogy ever made this film breaks <UNK> in both directing and storytelling it is not only about our modern life but about where life could and should be in our modern time and although the movie is more subtle than both blue and white it <UNK> <UNK> a statement of love and compassion br br it's hard to imagine that red was <UNK> last film and that he died at such a young age nevertheless the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with bergman fellini and <UNK> as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an oscar <UNK> you have been missed
<START> i saw this in the cinema during its initial release and can only ask has the world gone mad the seemingly overwhelming positive response is mind <UNK> for this poorly written predictable <UNK> trap br br <UNK> elliot is no genius film maker as <UNK> by the consistent bombs he has produced since check out <UNK> to <UNK> of the br br i can only assume making a film dealing with the gay <UNK> culture has people assuming that to dislike the film is an offense to this <UNK> of the <UNK> aren't we smarter than that what about an interesting script and good performances ok so the 3 leads do alright considering what they have to work with but this film includes the worst performance by a child actor i have ever seen not helped by appalling dialogue and a really lame resolution that you can see a mile off br br this is a disappointing film and one that doesn't deserve the overblown reputation it has garnered
<START> this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen the visuals were so <UNK> choppy it made me <UNK> i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out and the frequent black and white to color switch i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever and it was another clichéd action movie with a hero a bad guy and a few <UNK> i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why i can hold it steady something the director couldn't do over all truly the worst i have ever seen you thought disney was bad i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome and the visual were the worst i have ever seen
<START> well i like this movie first of all because it's very well thought of and well because the um director and others chose an extremely great actor to play mike and also my last reason because my opinion <UNK> wood is so so hot
<START> is by far the best <UNK> take on bollywood i have ever seen i didn't grow up with bollywood but i've seen a few hundred of them now i'd say it leaves <UNK> <UNK> mira <UNK> and even <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> almost in the dust <UNK> <UNK> the director really loves bollywood and he has the self confidence to allow us to know it there's humor but no arch ironic <UNK> no of course i don't really mean this stuff as jerry lee lewis would say he gets it and so he can let us have it too the joy of a bollywood movie experience along with touches that are <UNK> by a <UNK> stepping into the story role br br it's a story about a <UNK> bitchy beautiful american b movie actress she's only been in movies with numbers in their titles like fatal attraction 3 who finds herself in a different bollywood movie from the one she went to india to be in <UNK> 3 has <UNK> its <UNK> while she was en route apparently because its producers are now in jail salman khan in real life a bollywood mega mega star is the dancing master of the delightful written on the fly movie she has now been pulled into is this before or after i go blind and through the <UNK> of his mildly <UNK> gifted character she learns more than how to find her inner <UNK> dancing ability br br the strong beginning gives you both bollywood a super energetic <UNK> of dancers in front of the <UNK> <UNK> both funny an familiar to the western viewer as well as providing the high <UNK> musical thrill we love in a hindi movie and salman on screen from the outset no bollywood 20 minute wait for the hero he has on an indian costume <UNK> with <UNK> carson style western movie <UNK> all in white br br ali actress character is pleasing to the western viewer she's blonde which is traditional for a white person in a bollywood movie and visually understandable casting but she's a <UNK> girl not the <UNK> kind of <UNK> we're usually presented with and she's a more or less three dimensional total bitch carrying on <UNK> and abusive cell phone conversations with a boyfriend and agent in the us br br we also have scenes of women who are having problems with each other going out to a bar to deal with them the capacity for people not getting along to relate and have emotional conversations is traditional in hindi movies but we seldom see much of any such thing going on between women other than the discussion between mother and daughter about the daughter's choice of <UNK> let alone strangers unrelated people let alone bar going so the spirit is the same the details are fresh and i was completely delighted by this br br i only saw it once at a preview showing attended by the director a fine <UNK> and question he and salman got to be brother like good friends over the making of it he loves india he has plans to make a wizard of oz movie in india i can't get too detailed about songs when i've seen them just once except to say i liked them all they range from a happy parody of the bollywood number in the movie within the movie the <UNK> costumes with hats and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's a beach scene on dresses are worth the cost of a ticket alone to a lovely <UNK> many <UNK> romantic song in a <UNK> and more serious part of the movie br br mix of hindi and english in the music and it works br br salman khan gets a lot of credit from me for <UNK> to unusual projects this and <UNK> e mann and good judgment about which ones to be in <UNK> said he was full of <UNK> and ideas all along the way and totally fine i e not <UNK> at all whether <UNK> accepted or rejected them clearly just a pro who loves being involved and <UNK>
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer <UNK> around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as <UNK> as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by <UNK> i'll be writing those <UNK> down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> this game is not exactly the best <UNK> game ever sure it's good but only when there's 4 players without 4 players the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill but half of this game are levels where you have to save so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels and that gets quite boring the graphics don't exactly reach the level of super mario 64 or even mario <UNK> 64 and if you're talking a great <UNK> in a 1st person <UNK> you'll have to go with perfect dark at least you can play <UNK> by yourself
<START> this is the middle cartoon of the three between rabbit fire and duck rabbit duck and is the weakest of the three while still being quite funny it simply depends on one gag for too much of the action still a good cartoon i feel a definite sympathy for <UNK> in this one which is rare for me <UNK> is so clearly that it almost becomes painful to watch at times good cartoon in an excellent series recommended
<START> prey br br aspect ratio 1 <UNK> 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br a lesbian couple sally <UNK> and glory living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man barry who turns out to be a flesh eating alien the <UNK> of a massive invasion br br despite its <UNK> budget and <UNK> pacing norman j <UNK> follow up to <UNK> slave 1976 amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its <UNK> parts thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max <UNK> apparently his only writing credit <UNK> and <UNK> an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated <UNK> within the english countryside rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v eye catching cinematography though discovery of <UNK> clothing in an upstairs room marks one or both of these <UNK> eyed <UNK> as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and under mysterious circumstances unexpected arrival throws the relationship into <UNK> partly because <UNK> has a <UNK> hatred of men and partly because is attracted to him creating tensions which result in a climactic <UNK> of violence there's an extraordinary multi layered sequence in which <UNK> attempts to their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing though alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery br br in the early scenes at least the relationship between <UNK> and is depicted with <UNK> grace and dignity but this heartfelt <UNK> quickly <UNK> into crowd pleasing episodes of sex and culminating in an explosion of horror when allows herself to be <UNK> by following a violent argument with <UNK> the closing sequences are quite literally gut wrenching especially final scene which appears to have been <UNK> for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored what remains is still pretty vivid so <UNK> yourselves excellent performances by the three leads <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> direction which takes full advantage of the stunning <UNK> locations thereby <UNK> for the film's <UNK> shortcomings originally released in the us as alien prey
<START> dictator of is a spoiled child who becomes angry when he cannot gets what he really wants and what he simply wants is nothing less than the world br br in one of the extraordinary scenes of chaplin art performs a ballet with the <UNK> which bursts when he thinks he has it in his grasp br br chaplin also has some biting words on war and war films in a scene at the beginning of the movie which takes place during world war i the <UNK> crashes the plane and thinks he is about to die in a state of <UNK> he begins to say ridiculous words the empty double talk continue <UNK> into a brilliant take off on all the heroic death scenes of war films br br in another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the jewish ghetto and assumes command of the resistance <UNK> rebellion among the old men he plans to kill the dictator one of the group must kill the ruthless <UNK> of whoever is chosen will naturally die but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in history br br the sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream <UNK> containing <UNK> to determine which shall sacrifice his life to murder the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear br br for all its disappointing shortcomings the great dictator is still a significant movie for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither chaplin nor anymore else could have given it the irony of history the necessity to murder <UNK> the assassination attempt against hitler by his <UNK> the force of the original satire is only <UNK> by <UNK> imitation of art br br with a splendid sequence like the duck shooting accident which leads to the dictator being mistaken for the <UNK> jewish <UNK> and vice versa the great dictator is <UNK> first talking movie this time and not ' wanting to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy the last in which he uses his celebrated character '
<START> this should have been a moody gritty movie which <UNK> in the memory as an exposition of relationship where the <UNK> personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of change br br the acting was intense and <UNK> the dialogue worked but the movie was <UNK> <UNK> too many distance shots that suggested lack of focus rather than a <UNK> picture poor flow the first 5 minutes could have been missed out altogether br br i suspect that with a different edit this movie could have been compelling br br in its current form it is flat <UNK> and tremendously disappointing
<START> <UNK> aspiring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack and his best buddy george the deliciously deadpan joel murray go to for the summer following <UNK> from high school <UNK> george and several <UNK> pals come to the aid of <UNK> <UNK> moore at her most charming a singer who's family house is being threatened with <UNK> by the greedy clan writer director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of admittedly broad and dumb but still very funny jokes the constant <UNK> <UNK> has a real <UNK> good natured and <UNK> inane <UNK> to it that's impossible to either dislike or resist moreover the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> egg <UNK> tom <UNK> as his goofy brother clay curtis armstrong as the sweet <UNK> <UNK> raymond mark <UNK> as evil rich jerk matt as the mean teddy <UNK> foster as the <UNK> cookie joe <UNK> as the <UNK> ho general raymond william <UNK> as <UNK> old man jeremy <UNK> as smug <UNK> bully <UNK> and john as <UNK> biker stan slick cinematography the hip soundtrack <UNK> cool <UNK> score and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent single funniest scene egg in a godzilla suit <UNK> a posh dinner party an absolute hoot
<START> i don't usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas br br naturally here in the uk we are about 2 through the 3rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season 3 via other means i'm still glued every friday at <UNK> br br from the very first episode of season 1 i have been a big big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on dvd yes i cannot wait for season 4 to start in october br br so why do i love this show so much well i have to agree with the last poster james <UNK> i know one person cannot make a team but big ed was made for <UNK> or maybe it was the other way around i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed no way i also agree that <UNK> character is getting very soft i also preferred the tough take no sh t big bad eddy d that we saw in season 1 2 he seems to have <UNK> out br br as i said no one person makes the team by and of course the other cast members josh danny james mike vanessa sam <UNK> cox mary molly <UNK> all contribute well even outside cast members such as <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> harry <UNK> as <UNK> dean caine as <UNK> mitchell as mitch who may feature 6 or 7 times during a season can fit in just as well as if they've been in every single episode from day one br br this show has everything drama action suspense laughs romance <UNK> and big time <UNK> who often play br br many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season 4
<START> <UNK> is part of a trilogy but very much stands on its own it isn't a sequel of any sort the very end which i won't <UNK> ties the three films together but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing br br this film <UNK> me because it is so spare so subtle and simple but is as effective emotionally and intellectually as any big budget spectacle or all star melodrama <UNK> here <UNK> the <UNK> of chance and destiny both themes are loosely woven together in the story the film is very much a puzzle but the message is pretty straightforward everything happens for a reason love is in all of our <UNK> as long as we open ourselves to it the title red refers to the french flag where red represents <UNK> or <UNK> the color <UNK> the visuals of the movie i tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life it's great when a film allows the freedom to do that
<START> maybe if you've never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film it has the directorial and scripting skill of the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between <UNK> and <UNK> very well br br the characters in this production are badly miscast sutherland as <UNK> seems a total <UNK> likewise acts the fool and it is that he my be a friend of <UNK> i can't imagine how <UNK> <UNK> could have accepted the role maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version br br quotes from the book are thrown in out of context huge <UNK> are missing the important episode with is <UNK> over br br mr collins is however very good and towers above the other members of the cast br br the only good thing is we didn't pay to see it wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the jesus out of me i loved it so much and i was dying to get my hands on it br br in 2002 i remembered that this movie existed but i had no idea what it was called so i went to the i need to know section on imdb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it anyway eventually someone on imdb told me so i <UNK> and tried to buy the movie so eventually i got a hold of it on dvd and i now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies i really love it and i think anyone who watches it will be very scared in the woods the next time they go 9 10
<START> if you go into the twins effect looking for a pure hong kong movie experience you will be disappointed this is not to say it is bad but it is not a traditional hong kong action movie running in a similar vein to shaolin soccer and kung fu <UNK> it's <UNK> silly and juvenile so if you want a good bit of serious hong kong action look to a john woo or <UNK> woo <UNK> movie this movie's got a lot of <UNK> for it's silliness and i thought the first thing i should do would be to explain what you're getting into as it's disappointed a lot of <UNK> br br for the non <UNK> and those with more <UNK> tastes though twins effect is a delightfully silly kung fu comedy i liked it a lot for a variety of reasons not least it's wonderful female leads who spark off each other in a thoroughly entertaining comedy double act i believe this is the first movie of it's type they've been in but they hop kick and fly about like seasoned pros br br the <UNK> ridiculous plot is handled with a great deal of care and attention and the movie is quite <UNK> written making a lot of the movie laugh out loud the comedy really is the most prominent thing here and it's a subtle gentle comedy as <UNK> on words as <UNK> objects going flying a la stephen <UNK> it has to be said the slapstick is immense fun too the sequence with the disco dancing vampires is a total classic br br the action is a blend of two genres really it falls between the <UNK> wire and sword fighting which comes in more toward the end and the comedy fighting style of jackie chan coming out with a blend that though a little derivative at times is always exciting to watch and occasionally throws up some genuinely innovative encounters br br all this is great and the movie is tremendous fun all the way through despite this it does have a few sticking points for instance twins effect is in many ways much more <UNK> than kung fu fans are perhaps used to the inevitable comparison to the blade series is definitely sound as an example though twins effect is honestly much better than blade ever managed especially for fighting action personally it was also a bit of a shame to see the excellent anthony wong the villain from john <UNK> classic hard boiled so underused but the younger audience this is aimed at are unlikely to notice this or indeed know about hard boiled or his other movies so this is only really a personal <UNK> br br if you watch this with an open mind you'll probably enjoy it greatly like i did but you must be firmly aware it is a comedy not a balls to the wall kung fu movie keep that in mind and you'll be fine
<START> well i've read the book first and thought wow would this be cool to see in a movie than i started searching and found there was already a movie made of it i bought the movie a week ago on dvd and watched it they did it awfully wrong at first this kid who isn't any character in the book then the mix between the two books 'the river <UNK> and 'the seventh than nicolas needing <UNK> while in the book he himself is actually the the whole thing about the is wrong also is supposed to have invented the lightweight <UNK> the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of <UNK> <UNK> around it the tomb itself was made in a <UNK> with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient <UNK> game there was nothing in the movie about nicolas being english and was a <UNK> christian in the book not a muslim this list is endless there were only a few things good about the movie the actors which played boris mick and were well chosen the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book was the worst it didn't get even close to the character that was in my head while i wrote the book it is such a shame that such a great book is <UNK> in such a bad <UNK> i wonder why <UNK> smith ever gave his <UNK> for this
<START> i first saw this film when released in 1980 from other sources i've <UNK> that the only release of the minute cut was in new york city after which it was severely cut to <UNK> minutes so i guess i saw the shorter version first which at the time i thought was a very interesting anti western if a <UNK> confusing br br so it was with even more interest that i finally <UNK> a dvd of the full length version i'm glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical <UNK> <UNK> on michael <UNK> was <UNK> to say the very least br br yes it's a long movie but so have been many others for example once upon a time in america 1984 at <UNK> minutes <UNK> 1963 at minutes the ten <UNK> 1956 at <UNK> minutes <UNK> restored version 1960 at minutes gone with the wind 1939 at <UNK> minutes and others so it can't be the fact of running time that made so many <UNK> at the mouth way back when <UNK> gate came on the scene br br but note this all of those above movies have everything to do with <UNK> <UNK> about history and heroes br br not so <UNK> gate in this narrative the american west is shown in all its grim and <UNK> <UNK> injustice and poverty and that's probably the first reason why so many disliked this film it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of <UNK> in <UNK> showing how the <UNK> stock <UNK> association hired 50 <UNK> to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle <UNK> and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities right up to the president of the united states for an <UNK> on that war with the background and what happened there is a link at <UNK> under johnson county war br br very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country's history and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be had it been a documentary it would have been barely <UNK> for most as entertainment it was almost bound to fail <UNK> and be torn to <UNK> by the shrill and infamous br br leaving aside the <UNK> political <UNK> for a moment that <UNK> launched <UNK> what about the narrative  the story of the three main characters well it probably wasn't unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute just as it's probably not unusual now it's a fairly standard love triangle <UNK> ella must choose between the two men and ultimately decides upon the younger man nathan who although not above <UNK> to cold blooded murder when it suits him shows more spirit and commitment than the older james or jim as most people in the film say for some that part of the story threads too slowly perhaps in the context of the wider narrative about the war however it is i think entirely appropriate br br and that war is depicted <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> with scenes of carnage that are <UNK> staged and edited <UNK>  although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants i'm certain that some scenes of <UNK> blowing apart are repeated a minor point and perhaps brought about when the minute cut was restored any way you look at it though it hits you in the face with the noise dust chaos and confusion of war br br which brings me to another criticism by others the noise and dust is such that it's often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening i'll admit that i found that to be a <UNK> annoying at first even to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words  until i realized that really wasn't necessary if you accept the director's intent life is chaotic it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and in war it's the <UNK> <UNK> non of this <UNK> en scene in short it's as though you truly are present in and within the scenes br br and what of the title from shakespeare it refers to a <UNK> <UNK> to god and so if you <UNK> god with the natural world the stunning scenery that <UNK> the movie  and it is stunning <UNK> equal to that of david <UNK> doctor <UNK> 1965  is a useful metaphor i tend to think however that <UNK> had something more to say namely the idea that the brave immigrants  the god <UNK> salt of the earth  were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that <UNK> to be <UNK> champion br br was that <UNK> intent  to gut the myth of the american west to show how in america only the rich get rich while the poor are <UNK> one way or another throughout history is that anything new not really as we all know where it really hurt however is in showing how america was not and by <UNK> is not the land of the free and the home of the brave instead after absorbing this narrative we are left with an impression that the <UNK> of america have more to do with a land of <UNK> slaves and a home for
<START> i never figured out what the attraction of karen black was she always had those <UNK> eyes and kind of an odd look about her she seemed to often be eccentric or cast as the other woman in this one she is the psychic <UNK> and expert on the occult to a crummy producer of bad commercials as he learns <UNK> projection he is a mean sucker even without the new <UNK> apparently this is the <UNK> to <UNK> because if you get good at it you can inhabit the bodies of future generations i believe star trek had a plot like this with jack the <UNK> hanging on for several centuries anyway this guy is really dangerous he has a nice family and makes them miserable he begins to murder friends just because they have an <UNK> comment for them or he doesn't like them you can see the ending coming from the back row in left field it's a very harsh <UNK> movie most of it must be taken as truth why are some called but few chosen i found it long and not very satisfying
<START> for a long time i did not know weather i liked this film or not this is surprising because i usually do know but because the film did not go anywhere i was a bit confused br br two people move into a somewhat <UNK> household setting finding their <UNK> constantly working or away on business <UNK> their attention out of sheer loneliness wanders to each other after a <UNK> love affair the male lead played by tony <UNK> <UNK> that he has a mistress on the side <UNK> li played by maggie cheung is hurt even though their love affair has not been physically <UNK> leaves the country only to come back years later when everything has changed br br for the part the film is correct by never <UNK> or actually touching the part of love but only approaching it the film admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject it is also true i think that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair at least that's the feeling i get br br if we are to believe it however when <UNK> writes that love is a state of grace not the means to anything but the <UNK> and the <UNK> an end in itself then this film falls miserably short of this as do all others or if you are inclined to entirely <UNK> <UNK> hits it right on the mark what films in history have achieved approached or <UNK> this phrase if for only a short while my honest feeling in memory is that about two when harry met sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection and the getting is all in just getting there it is interesting that in when harry met sally this is done in the course of <UNK> rather than in its <UNK> can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals nicholas <UNK> recent film the <UNK> comes closer to this perhaps than any other film are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension or more true perhaps becomes <UNK> vehicle for other ends br br in the mood for love is an honest film with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that <UNK> has to offer yet all it manages to say in the end is that life is sometimes like this now this is by no means a <UNK> thing to say especially if said well but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when <UNK> <UNK> wong tries to round out the film by relating only for the second time a <UNK> historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place this is a worthy effort and the variation on the musical <UNK> played throughout the film is rather brilliant but the relatively spare <UNK> plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the inclined audience leaving the viewer to split the difference a mistake in any film a director should know where he is going and how to get there but in all honesty it is only one wrong turn however as anyone knows all it takes is one notable <UNK> to spoil the perfect barrel of honey br br the effort though is definitely worth while trying to let a historical theme <UNK> and round out the film and raise it beyond the <UNK> meaning of the couple but without any real <UNK> it is the crucial mistake in a word and unfortunately it is too little too late it is also i think too much of a challenge for the non asian viewer not familiar enough with <UNK> history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke
<START> this is an incredible movie that begins slowly it leads you along in thinking of it as a typical <UNK> family drama then in the second half there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope br br if you are <UNK> to films from india with song and dance routines seemingly <UNK> on for no reason stick with this movie especially beginning with the second half you will find this movie an amazing experience br br minor spoiler here i have but one complaint with the movie the dialog at the end between and <UNK> seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people's lives it was implied all along but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for <UNK>
<START> first i loved the documentary it represents a new school history theory where a subject can reflect a wide range of social and historical issues br br i'll get the camera and dogs out of the way first i hate the blair witch quality of the camera but also understand the advantage of such a casual approach in fact i agree with the other reviewer that it gives us <UNK> access br br dogs warning i have a <UNK> degree in literature which i do not use as a profession so some of my training may <UNK> in the dogs are a beautiful metaphor for the complex relationship of <UNK> great <UNK> and our need to find the labor to achieve them the dogs might reflect their owners as one reviewer suggested but they also serve as a stand in for the workers we see in the film while this might hint at the <UNK> problem raised by one reviewer i think it also shows how difficult it is to labor issues no in italy may not translate as well elsewhere <UNK> i am a <UNK> at heart and hate to hear my cynical <UNK> hold <UNK> it is a remarkable bait and switch the dogs are family the workers are family but in the end the dogs are the workers the last scene with the poor farmer while you may disagree with the politics the artistry of the <UNK> coupled with the more overt politics of the film are wonderful br br had only <UNK> i am from <UNK> had the power of film beyond the hollywood market what interesting tales would have been told
<START> cheap <UNK> bad cheese from the 80's the decade of cheese i watched this one first uncut and un and it was pretty much laugh out loud funny even without the comments br br the plot such as it is revolves around a post apocalyptic world in which the <UNK> robots <UNK> sound familiar and destroyed pretty much everything leaving a world in ruins with air so bad no one can breathe it the few humans that are left act as slaves to an enigmatic being called the dark one which seems to be part computer and part <UNK> being the work to produce energy for this being in return for <UNK> air every once in a while the dark one has the strongest of the air slaves fight to the death so that no one will rise as a leader in a revolt against the dark one br br okay that's the so called serious stuff on to the silly stuff such as the ridiculous quasi futuristic clothing that everyone sports including car seat cover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and stuff and <UNK> worn mostly by the dark one's <UNK> a chick with an <UNK> and almost non understandable accent or the wooden acting and stilted lines <UNK> by all of the so called <UNK> who's dialog is high on <UNK> and low on sense or the dime store special fx including pink <UNK> with teeth glued onto them for <UNK> snakes a bomb made of strung piano wire and a tin can and terrible with halloween rubber masks on br br a band of air slaves follow their leader a mysterious <UNK> who has adapted to the air outside to go to the energy plant to destroy the dark one the guy's name is neo which explains where the <UNK> brothers got the idea for the matrix they meet up with a group of <UNK> along the way with the obligatory fight scene in which the female is <UNK> of course has anyone else ever noticed that in every amazon movie or t v show ever produced these so called amazing warriors always get their <UNK> kicked by either men or women <UNK> are just <UNK> i guess br br this band of determined warriors makes their way through central park <UNK> the <UNK> lands beyond the last standing city good way to save money on the <UNK> paintings of a destroyed new york city anyway and journey into the <UNK> leading to the power station where the dark one and his go go girl <UNK> <UNK> hang out here they <UNK> such <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> puppet worms a giant spider no one sees and the goofy <UNK> robot who is one of the dark one's personal guard br br the final showdown is pretty sad one of the slaves a girl who's father was taken by the dark one because he'd produced a way for people to breathe the foul air sees that her father has been by the dark one's true form which involves him being eaten by a giant <UNK> until only his head is sticking out the three remaining <UNK> destroy the dark one by turning off a few switches and the robot holocaust dies not with a bang but with a <UNK> the two humans exchange some amazingly wooden last lines and that's it the end
<START> maybe it was the fact that i saw spider man the day before i saw wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them <UNK> with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of the characters and the story was <UNK> at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movie
<START> saying this movie is worse than on your own <UNK> is a generous understatement the only thing more pathetic than this <UNK> piece of garbage of a movie is the getting paid by the producers to register a bunch of accounts to post fake <UNK> br br if watching a poorly acted <UNK> <UNK> of a movie about <UNK> from the <UNK> kill people in a fashion that completely ignores every law of physics pulling on an <UNK> person's legs causing them to be ripped from the <UNK> is your idea of a good movie then knock yourself out br br no <UNK> based with a <UNK> <UNK> would consider in a million <UNK> that this movie is scary or entertaining
<START> instead watch it as a great coming of age tale about african american males in the mid 1960's in the <UNK> of chicago for all of you out there under the age of 50 what's happening was a light hearted rather quirky sitcom with very few serious moments that lasted four years 1975 1979 concerning a group of young african american high school kids living in a working class neighborhood i liked it a great deal it just has no real connection to this film <UNK> high started out as being the basis for what's happening but its serious nature did not register well with test audiences so it was <UNK> as a comedy even though the credits on what's happening still read that it was based on this movie br br this film starts out light but touches many aspects of life unique to the <UNK> 1960's and also some other aspects of growing up that are timeless the guys deal with sex betrayal <UNK> and even early death the ending is quite powerful and serious and the film has a great <UNK> soundtrack highly recommended unfortunately this film is not new enough to be played on <UNK> cable channels and not considered old enough to be considered a classic movie and played in the few <UNK> for those films either
<START> no this is not an ed wood movie <UNK> love is stan <UNK> and oliver <UNK> last silent movie the end of an era in the laurel hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly this present day br br it's a shame that this movie is however not among their best br br the premise of the movie sounds good and is good the boys team up with a goat this time which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch it however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable the comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable br br of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent laurel hardy entry br br 7 10
<START> i hired this movie out from my local movie shop not really expecting anything to flash or fancy since it was a b grade movie made on a very tight budget the opening scenes of the film were rather original and so was the plot and thats what made me hire the movie out however the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points the story had plenty of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of <UNK> as well by the end of the film i was praying that a higher power was going to strike me down where i laid as i was extremely bored but more importantly frustrated with how the story turned out i still don't understand what actually happened and i don't particularly care in conclusion the devil would cry in disgust to know that hell his <UNK> was used as a basis for such a crappy film
<START> oh i'm mostly not the kind of person to give a movie less than 5 points mostly just because of the effort from actors and directors br br 3 10 for from me if anyone thinks the main character or whoever deserves an oscar i deserve the for peace br br seriously i can't believe this movie made it to europe the acting was horrible the plot was awful and what about the <UNK> horror music give me a break br br <UNK> <UNK> what about him why is he there he has nothing to do with the movie br br and what about the talking one time he can't say a decent word the next time he's getting all talky talk he also nearly dies when he wakes up and some <UNK> shines thru his <UNK> but when he's walking down the street the <UNK> doesn't seem to do anything br br watch this movie only of you're on the edge of dying of boredom i regret myself for not watching my <UNK> grow which are in anyway more entertaining than this piece of
<START> sometimes it's hard to be a pirate but by <UNK> miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying and it shows particularly during her first spot of friendly <UNK> with mr thomas <UNK> <UNK> when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face with fifty years of <UNK> <UNK> seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an <UNK> for the <UNK> of women in a male dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m <UNK> or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time it was an exciting entertaining family film with absolutely no <UNK> hidden meanings or alternative agenda it was fun m louis is both <UNK> and <UNK> as her love interest mr herbert <UNK> is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the but it is miss peters who stays in the memory <UNK> adolescent illiterate tough but vulnerable wonderfully <UNK> and ultimately courageous she is everybody's idea of a lady pirate there was a definite window of opportunity for her in <UNK> costume roles that she did not choose to <UNK> it is a matter of some regret
<START> the worst movie ever hardly this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen it has appearances from all the great characters from the animated tv series <UNK> very safe for small children and the colors capture their attention like no other there is an evil princess trying to steal the diamond planet which would in turn cause all life on earth to <UNK> this tells the tale of how <UNK> and her new friend are able to stop the evil plot and <UNK> life and color back to earth it's proof that kids can make a difference <UNK> will live on forever
<START> it resembles so much to movies like pulp fiction or <UNK> dogs that is impossible to think that <UNK> films weren't a source of inspiration to this <UNK> however for a low cost b series movie it's not bad the plot about gangsters is captivating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm we can find in pulp fiction the resources weren't many <UNK> sure but the film is well produced the acting also is good i enjoyed the scene when the girl was sat on the <UNK> <UNK> the doctor it was hot and funny at the same time the soundtrack is nice too i didn't hear too many songs but the ones i heard i liked i score it 7 10
<START> the acting was terrible the cheesy fake cheap green screen effects were ridiculous and the creatures were absolutely retarded the only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laughs i got from watching such a bad movie then i became pretty angry because i realized i wasted 4 bucks on renting it why would a movie like this ever be in theaters i know this movie came out almost 5 years ago but does anyone put any effort into making movies anymore i am just writing random things to fill up space because i need ten lines of text in order to <UNK> this review this next line should just about do it there
<START> decent but overrated dramatic thriller film attempts to depict the <UNK> out of control inner demons of a tormented artist the problem is not a single relationship illustrated on screen is believable and <UNK> appears to have been thrown out the window the title character is so difficult to relate to making it's rather impossible to imagine any of the on screen characters emotionally invested in him either the conclusion is also fairly predictable there are certainly enough clues provided from the get go to indicate exactly where the story is headed choosing to entirely suspend one's belief in the situations or the relationships the film itself is well acted especially by the leads and manages to create some nice tension as the story unfolds as a <UNK> feature there is some food for thought and had the script been stronger there's certainly potential here that could have been put to better use
<START> ever sense i was a kid i have loved this movie i have always been a fan of joseph the kid had pure talent in both this movie and jurassic park i have been looking for the dvd or vhs to purchase at a store near me i cant seem to find it i hope it goes on dvd well anyways great movie if anyone knows where i can find this please contact me at net also can anyone really explain what happened with bobby was her real or was he fake and was he <UNK> imaginary friend and his escape lol i'm clueless my favorite part had to be definitely where they made the monster juice and <UNK> it all over the kitchen its funny but also a sad part as well because of what happens to bobby due to the mess i would've liked to see the boyfriends face because he played his part pretty good i think the mother was a great actress i think her name is <UNK> <UNK> or some sorta name like that well thats all please contact me br br
<START> i didn't know anything about this movie before i watched it it seems to be a lesser known teen horror from the 80's what struck me were the ways it <UNK> from so many other movies from that era br br the first thing i noticed was how slowly this movie builds it doesn't do the typical setup of showing characters being murdered one by one it takes its time building the back story leaving a little bit of mystery about what might happen i was almost starting to think no one would even really get hurt in this movie but everything leads to the climatic sequence during the last 15 minutes and then it gets fairly graphic this was a bad time to take a <UNK> break i almost couldn't finish my pizza once it started br br the characters also seem slightly more three dimensional than a lot of the cheap teen scare flicks there conversations were <UNK> level headed for the most part as opposed to the over the top stereotypes you'd expect for example the girl who is the popular <UNK> queen <UNK> of the <UNK> isn't constantly <UNK> insults at everyone but is capable of having doubts and showing some consideration for others br br so to <UNK> i felt this movie was somewhat original compared to what i expected and a little better made as well it drew me in kept me interested and then let me have it as i said it's pretty gory during the finale but almost family friendly much of the rest of the time i don't need to own it but i'm glad i discovered it
<START> this should not have been made into a movie everything about it was idiotic and i don't think i laughed even once there were bits and pieces that were okay i guess but that's about it a lot of parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which did them a hell of a lot better there were some famous actors actresses in this but no one did a good job they must've just not cared this is one of those movies that tries to have a cute ending but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values <UNK> top is probably the worst comedian out there right now do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one br br final decisions br br movies <UNK> br br purchase dvd absolutely not br br rental only if you've seen everything else and have a free <UNK> but even then it's still not worth your while
<START> wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this br br i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie br br i will now be more <UNK> when i watch late night movies br br this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i don't think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary movie series look intelligent br br 1 10 i'd give it a 0 if they would let me
<START> ken <UNK> showed the world the down and out flip side of swinging london with poor cow about london woman joy carol white <UNK> up with a thief and having a son with him only to see the man end up in the <UNK> while his friend <UNK> <UNK> manages to help her out some he proves to be little better in what a loser he is it soon becomes clear to joy that she's going to have to make a serious decision about where she's going in her life br br one thing that i determined i don't know whether or not this is accurate was a use of irony in the movie her name is joy but she experiences no joy in her life even if that wasn't intended it's still a movie that i recommend to everyone featuring songs by <UNK> one of which colors appeared in another <UNK> <UNK> movie the <UNK> which incidentally came out in 1999 when i was as old as my parents were when poor cow came out
<START> seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits unfortunately it was a standard case of the funny bits were in the preview not to say it was all bad but the good bits were in the preview br br if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie
<START> too bad somebody did not have the <UNK> to release this movie to theaters i had never heard of it when it appeared on cable after the first shock of realizing this is not like any other movie you have seen since bringing up baby you have to let it <UNK> you along and run with it not until it's over do you realize it covers issues that are not only subtle but significant alienation denial wish <UNK> for a start cathy bates owns this movie she's never been better the whole cast has the feel of the plot and knows what they're doing without laying on gratuitous <UNK> except where it's called for as with julie <UNK> bits or jonathan <UNK> camp videos if you're not open minded you won't get it see mark bizarre review which he <UNK> to <UNK> of stephanie <UNK> her career and her brother's for introducing <UNK> oil or something to island natives taking that as a cue i might as well spend time stellar cameo as a tv station <UNK> or jack shower scene so cast aside all previous concepts of film comedy and have a good time i loved it
<START> idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots yes camp blood or if you're wanting an awful <UNK> than bad pun that suits a <UNK> than bad film camp bloody awful is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film br br awful acting check bad script check tacky effects check no originality whatsoever double check br br it doesn't even attempt to be different and is <UNK> with every predicted cliché imaginable for example the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods so of course they end up dead br br one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually <UNK> two sequels how and why only <UNK> the mind br br just stay away from this one
<START> there really is very little positive that can be said about this film walter <UNK> is a truly unconvincing hero and even <UNK> when he tries to go undercover as a villain who we're meant to believe drinks too much and knocks his wife about a bit margaret <UNK> as the wife undercover sergeant is a little more convincing but it's still difficult to believe that any hood worth their salt would not have seen through their <UNK> in less than a minute the plot about a <UNK> heist is silly and the action drags rather than grips david <UNK> who plays <UNK> in the same way that david <UNK> seems to play all his roles is the only <UNK> of light in a wholly dull affair
<START> <UNK> was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard <UNK> there is however not much killing to be found in this movie and none of it is <UNK> shown the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when <UNK> <UNK> one of the eight unfortunate <UNK> to death in her own <UNK> yet even this is merely implied and not shown save for a few unconvincing <UNK> <UNK> of mr leg the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice over which should be a testament to the mind numbingly boring nature of this movie every aspect of this movie is horrible unless you have a <UNK> for boredom don't bother this movie only <UNK> in at <UNK> minutes but it feels like an eternity
<START> i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish what was the movie about what is it a spoof fantasy comedy satire no answer there from <UNK> screenplay totally confused and <UNK> <UNK> from one historical age to another i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and <UNK> on what it is about 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981 roger ebert has it right in his review the movie is ambiguous and looks like <UNK> romp with money just to make a vague children's move <UNK> as a historical <UNK> the movie also tries to confuse the would be viewer by giving john <UNK> and sean connery top billing
<START> i won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating plenty of other people have already done that suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that i've owned on dvd this is the only one that i got rid of it was so worthless that i couldn't see ever wanting to watch any of it again br br however i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2 9 as of 3 15 <UNK> while <UNK> through the 4 pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than 3 stars looking at the voting history <UNK> of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less it looks to me like a few people are <UNK> the <UNK> box to keep this movie off of the imdb bottom 100 list it would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars none of who wrote a review of the movie are actual active users br br don't be fooled this movie isn't worth your time
<START> this movie has a big production feel that i was not expecting from an independent film the characters are each developed and dealt with in a way that not only helps to tell the story but left me with a satisfied viewing experience
<START> this film was really different from what i had imagined but <UNK> my expectations nevertheless this film has the exactly right mixture of comedy drama political criticism and satire not necessarily in that order without being <UNK> or it reveals the open and subtle problems of our <UNK> <UNK> high technology society it makes you laugh instantly and remain in thought afterwards for those of you who liked <UNK> the dog and wished to have <UNK> and politicians this film should definitely be the choice br br politicians are a lot like <UNK> they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons
<START> this movie was the second movie i saw on the cinema as a child it scared the living crap out of me so much so that i asked my father if we could leave halfway through br br nowadays the only people leaving halfway through are the ones who have a good taste in movies br br i however still have fond memories of this flawed masterpiece of awfulness doug <UNK> and peter cushing in the same movie great monsters made of substitute scary stuff a rubber monster is when you think about it is even scarier than a real monster br br the astonishing thing about this movie is how good the score is truly rousing stuff br br there's also plenty of <UNK> <UNK> on show too nice
<START> i used to think that it came from hollywood was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror sci fi crime and drama movies of course i hadn't seen this beauty yet br br what's wrong with terror in the <UNK> four things br br 1 it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along and what bones are thrown to the true classics i e the black and white films like frankenstein dracula and the wolf man are either shown with martin and lewis or <UNK> and <UNK> alongside or not at all br br 2 the clips are most times so brief and out of their place that they just give a <UNK> shock to the viewer and for those unfamiliar with these films will make no sense at all indeed the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy <UNK> in jaws is shown much to the effect of a sight gag whereas in the <UNK> context it had power br br 3 did we really need <UNK> and allen in the audience reminding us that it's only a movie or that most of the violence in the horror movies is sadly against women so is that an <UNK> against the movie makers for adding those scenes or the movie goers who into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again sorry that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie br br 4 and most importantly why is the movie so short it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film they could have had a that's entertainment style movie that would have been <UNK> more entertaining heck even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing cushing was alive then mind you and better yet even vincent price would have been more than willing i'll bet what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience br br but no all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie don't get me wrong it was good to see what clips they did show but if they could have just done more with the goods br br two stars another good idea left laying in the <UNK>
<START> from the acting to direction this new twist on the familiar <UNK> been done wrong theme will keep you glued to your seat slow at times because it builds this <UNK> gonna <UNK> tension medium well on gore but what there is nicely nasty spoiler the death of the and subsequent feast is a highlight for gore <UNK> br br the writers crafted an old story but added twists and re imagined you typical haunting <UNK> brings it to life er uh death br br <UNK> <UNK> taylor <UNK> and the ever fabulous ben cross are real no signs of acting here everyone in the cast is committed and truly isn't that what any director <UNK> for the actors believe so we believe br br along with the traditional ghost story surprises the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere from the mine <UNK> house and the home there's a <UNK> fear from the first frame to the last br br horror fans do yourself a favor and enjoy what amounts to be one of the true horror movies out there today br br i end with a big to <UNK> <UNK> story ben screenplay for without inventive writers hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality tv party
<START> <UNK> bogart in his first starring role looks very young acts well but has a <UNK> <UNK> only hinted at later in his career still he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young <UNK> of a new airplane <UNK> br br dorothy is the real star here playing a once rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart he's broke too and the comfort and security of marrying an older man hale hamilton br br along for the ride are <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> sister <UNK> page as her would be producer barbara leonard as the jack kennedy as <UNK> and <UNK> as the faithful and wise butler br br both had been a star in silent films and bogart were trying to gain a in <UNK> in 1932 bogart was a slow rising actor from the broadway stage was <UNK> and would soon appear in <UNK> row production like picture brides yet they are both very good here wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film
<START> this low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods the fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile bad c g i or an obvious studio setting fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific very realistic film the crocodile is real there is no c g i and the on location filming takes place in an actual australian swamp the actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and they succeed you can place yourself in their <UNK> which is testament to how realistically black water <UNK> as entertainment highly recommended <UNK>
<START> i just wanted to say that i am watching national <UNK> on tv it is now <UNK> 2006 and i was checking on dates details etc surprising to see it was made in 1944 and rooney was 24 years old whilst liz taylor only 12 what an accomplished english actress she is br br to put some americans <UNK> right there are no irish <UNK> in england ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between <UNK> and county of no such scene exists now unfortunately like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and <UNK> br br so please all you lovely americans do not confuse ireland with england ever we take great exception to it like confusing texas with <UNK> island
<START> this film has to be as near to perfect a film as john ford made the film is magic a masterpiece the reason ford was well ford if you want to know why ford was great this one explains it br br the photography of course is superb black and white as black and white should be wonderful shots not an over the shoulder conversation in it pure ford great moments big and little the famous ripped pants of ward bond apparently two dogs kept <UNK> the set and fighting so ford wanted to use them in the fighting scene but instead of fighting one dog ran away and the other attacked ward bond and ripped his pants which caused ford no end of <UNK> a whole scene around a rope the way ben johnson burn then <UNK> his rope wonderful <UNK> and anticipation of the final harry <UNK> naive <UNK> of <UNK> the usual ford line about being scared and not showing it <UNK> horse accidentally falling in him and its left in the film johnson and bond are fantastic in that scene lord help any ford actor who does not stay in character while the camera is rolling even when a horse falls on top of you br br a couple of very sweet romances not <UNK> on the whole focus two very likable leads not to mention for the girls the number of times the cameras focus on ben <UNK> rather delightful <UNK> br br lots of old time <UNK> getting lines and roles cliff <UNK> frank <UNK> some wonderful character studies mostly of faces staring all the villains and main stars a set of villains to rival any group in any western br br many many <UNK> shots of faces groups children women small things happening in the background ford seems to love images of women in allowing the moment as <UNK> cross rivers and the camera <UNK> br br this is probably not a western as much as an <UNK> picture that happens to be set in the west br br lucky the film was made in 1950 because it is impossible to imagine such a film could be ever made again but then it is such a work of art that it would be a <UNK> to attempt it
<START> i gave airport <UNK> only two stars because it's a truly lousy film nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise except for <UNK> who does a pretty good job in his role this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching it helps if you have a buzz on but this is not essential br br really does seem like an early version of airplane every scene has a set up and a payoff and the scenes <UNK> after one another as if they were totally <UNK> one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers crew and airplane get to keep going no matter what you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence the hit man then chases you onto your <UNK> roof no problem you can still catch that early morning flight to paris no need to get the cops involved your plane <UNK> one <UNK> <UNK> missile four heat seeking <UNK> and cannon fire from an <UNK> phantom fighter doing barrel rolls an dive and a crash net landing without thrust in the process no problem we'll have the <UNK> check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours it's truly funny br br and i'll admit that there's a bit of the <UNK> in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin <UNK> the highlight is when the attendant tells <UNK> walker he'll have to put away his <UNK> god spare me from a flight <UNK> in front of a <UNK> playing jazz prior to take off <UNK> basically says nope later in the flight the <UNK> is damaged during a barrel roll and <UNK> actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another <UNK> that he won't put away this aspect of the film is just fun one passenger actually <UNK> the attendant when <UNK> is told she can't take her dog on the flight she leaves the plane naturally this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's <UNK> br br in summary a terrible movie but terrible enough to be a bit amusing unfortunately the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this as it was probably entirely unintentional
<START> there were very few good moments in this film only a couple of characters were fleshed out and not that well there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through the pace creep ed along like an old man there were many moments that the film never came back to like <UNK> <UNK> what happened to her how about sister is she better now what about <UNK> we learned absolutely nothing about him what about the electronic piano guy how about the rich girl that got an abortion what happened to her that was an interesting subplot br br overall this is not a good movie and i recommend another musical that was in this film let's do the time <UNK> again
<START> even after all these years this remain a perfect movie for me i still remember sitting for a long time in the theater after it was over stunned by the experience overcome by emotion i own the dvd of course is see at least once a year it's <UNK> and i cannot add much to has already been written about its excellence and beauty so glad others love it as much as i do a note the author of the book on which it's based michael was enchanted with the film and is <UNK> as saying he wished he had thought of some of the lovely scenes written purely for the movie the way <UNK> invites <UNK> to his side with a trail of small <UNK> and the way he <UNK> for <UNK> to view the <UNK> in the ruined medieval church
<START> it's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those <UNK> john cusack comedies made by savage steve holland and while i prefer there other more bizarre out there flick better off dead it's hard for me to dislike one crazy summer a movie i grew up loving <UNK> as a kid into my teens was a follow up to better off dead returning cusack and curtis armstrong from that film br br cusack is <UNK> following <UNK> pal joel murray george to for the summer to each some fun on the beach <UNK> finds himself <UNK> in a <UNK> with a blonde buff punk named teddy whose <UNK> father has designs on over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant <UNK> one of the homes needing it's <UNK> <UNK> belongs to <UNK> moore <UNK> there's a race which might be their only hope of saving <UNK> <UNK> home he had recently passed but it has been won by teddy over the past many years and <UNK> is <UNK> afraid of <UNK> over water but with the help and motivation of <UNK> friends such as <UNK> and tom <UNK> as auto mechanic twin brothers george and budding love interest <UNK> perhaps <UNK> can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a <UNK> manic weapons salesman general raymond <UNK> joe <UNK> in an inspired bit of casting <UNK> who uses the training from his father to assist <UNK> and company in their goals to win the race br br memorable scenes include <UNK> getting stuck in a godzilla suit running rampant across an entire model of mark <UNK> barely recognizable as rather unhinged pops 's <UNK> <UNK> being chased by deranged <UNK> <UNK> wishing to perform first aid george a victim of toxic <UNK> bruce <UNK> nutty uncle <UNK> increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show and the wonderful <UNK> bird as <UNK> grandma who actually bills the group after a meal jeremy <UNK> as you guessed it a <UNK> jerk who associates with teddy and causes trouble for <UNK> and his <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> foster as cookie girl who attempts to make out with <UNK> while he <UNK> a <UNK> with his father and the one and only william <UNK> as old man who will not reward his son and <UNK> an inheritance if they lose the <UNK> boat race <UNK> moore is cute but this is <UNK> vehicle though <UNK> and <UNK> steal most of the scenes their in again some delightful animation from holland are <UNK> throughout the movie <UNK> is an artist appropriately if you like his movies i highly recommend the underrated how i got into college
<START> for one thing he produced this movie it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed the opening credits tell us it was filmed in vienna br br <UNK> was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since the amazing mr x maybe it was dr x i remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie br br this one is pretty wooden unfortunately the plot isn't easy to follow when i got the hang of it i was disappointed anyway br br francis <UNK> looks great as a concert <UNK> he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier he never really caught on as a major star though he should have br br this isn't terrible but it's pretty heavy going
<START> although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all <UNK> still it was a good start from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a smart move from andy <UNK> to make his productions more <UNK> and viewer friendly in any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing joe buck naked almost all the time and the creative use of a flashy editing really wears off after the <UNK> time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half way this would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler instead of letting the actors make up some plot and dialog of their own
<START> <UNK> a french student moves into an apartment in <UNK> with a cast of six other characters from all over europe an italian a danish a german a british a spanish and a <UNK> br br he wants to get a job in <UNK> with the help of his father's friend he says there are jobs here a lot but if you know spanish and spanish market so he advice him to go spain <UNK> gets an <UNK> grand and fly to <UNK> by living his girlfriend and mother br br he first learns that the house he will stay is no longer available and the small rooms in <UNK> are even more expensive than he thinks he stays in a french couples house while he was looking for a house he has been interviewed with the 5 people from the house and has been accepted he had an affair with this french guys lovely wife and totally messed up everything with his <UNK> girlfriend br br do you want to hear more did you travel abroad for education watch this movie i promise that you will have a very nice time
<START> i'm not sure what i can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine and quite hilarious comments but ill try br br so you know the plot there is a bed possessed by a demon that <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the bodies of whoever or whatever lays on it with its orange <UNK> filled body we have the man in some scenes looking <UNK> like robert smith of the cure hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goings on and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed br br this is no ordinary bed no bob not only does it eat people but it <UNK> up after itself draws the covers back and it even makes itself who wouldn't want a bed like that it can even use its sheets as a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> escaped victims back in especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape br br our main story if you can call it that is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to house sit i don't recall exactly but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept the dialogue in the film is like no other the characters talk to each other seemingly by <UNK> as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo one of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of the gang and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an <UNK> voice over but we don't care character development was thrown out the window a long time before in this film so why start now there are scenes when the bed laughs <UNK> and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our <UNK> non reaction to said noises cant be heard this and the <UNK> makes the issue of very difficult to <UNK> but thats ok this is death bed the bed that eats and it defies all logic so its ok it makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film if you buy <UNK> buy did i say buy this dvd make sure to check out the introduction by the director he explains that the filming of this flick started in 1972 didn't wrap up until 1977 he <UNK> it for a few years with no luck and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on dvd supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made <UNK> after <UNK> of it and it was quite by chance on a message board no less that our director found evidence that people knew and gasp cared about his little known film its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it i'm glad he did once you've even so much as heard the title to this film you must see it i for one am going to buy this and i'm going to <UNK> its <UNK> around the world starting with this comment
<START> what was wes thinking making this <UNK> it does not <UNK> well with any of his other work but then again he seemed to fall into a slight <UNK> after making a a nightmare on elm street this can be seen by his follow ups 1 to hell 2 <UNK> 3 hills have eyes ii 4 deadly friend 5 and the <UNK> 6 shocker all of these films were either mediocre our crap it was not until people under the stairs that he gained his momentum back and started to kick butt again <UNK> has none of craven's <UNK> and none of his suspense the only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after for his job
<START> my first of the live action movie trailer <UNK> on youtube was wow this could be perhaps one of the few better live action anime adaptations br br this time i was just wrong simply put the live action movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces put together just enough to get the vague image of it all br br story br br the movies story vaguely follows the anime and manga but the movies story is just the frame of a car rather than a complete <UNK> it seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out altered or completely changed in fact the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings br br characters especially many left out or had a different feel the connection between and is reduced to that of knowing her because she's the video store lady character felt too strong already and only <UNK> the infamous i'm sorry a few times in the movie same can be said with we lost the shy uptight yet tall male lead the song he <UNK> and his frequent action of calling silly other characters like and had a different toned down feel to them perhaps the dropping and <UNK> down of other characters was to focus a lot more on and which it did way too much expecting a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer well don't those in the trailer plus a few minutes is the only amount of action you will get so much of the movie is talking that while i was <UNK> thru the movie before watching it all i thought i had gotten a regular asian romance drama br br pacing was way too fast in the film we see the famous scene of armed with small wings and a chain gun arm in just a little less than nine minutes of beginning it there is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them what they should have done was split it into two movies or even a trilogy if it had been not as many things would have to be changed or dropped br br but again the movie behaves like a frame the anime was more of a complete <UNK> because even if all those little details and such are minor they can really add up br br production br br visuals visuals were disappointing so much of the special effects turned out looking quite cheesy especially the cgi sadly they were like those found on sci fi channel movies they are bearable and this movie isn't for the effects br br music music was average much of it was <UNK> background music except there were really no themes the film has dropped the <UNK> song that in the anime was always <UNK> a noticeable piece of music though is the ending song heard in the trailer not a bad and somewhat beautiful song its a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an <UNK> version of the song br br casting casting was also so so the main star was actor <UNK> <UNK> who is most famous for her role in the battle <UNK> films the actor that played was pretty good but they took away the glasses from the original character oh yeah and <UNK> looks like <UNK> the 3rd br br unlike what i've heard from a few others the acting in the live action was not that bad i rather feel at fault is the way the story was laid out and <UNK> the series into just a two hour film br br what can be learned from the live action br br cgi i really wish the cgi in hadn't been that bad but even with just that we could have gotten a few more fight scenes probably the most anticipated live action anime adaptation <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> most likely wont suffer since they currently have <UNK> studios assigned to do the effects br br <UNK> owned a video shop used a audio <UNK> player to listen to music and gave a mix tape for his birthday why this movie is made in 2006 not only that in the movies reality they can create such a thing as so it cannot take place in the 90s the future is an age of <UNK> dvds and <UNK> players hopefully in <UNK> <UNK> will have a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> player not one that plays <UNK> tapes br br story pacing as mentioned earlier the movie moved too fast and forced the story to drop out many details it was a smart move upon <UNK> films and whoever else to make <UNK> into a solid trilogy thus allowing more time to <UNK> the story as true to the original as possible br br characters leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said what if the live action <UNK> didn't have what are you stupid or i <UNK> run away sometimes as small as they seem those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are br br conclusion br br all in all the live action movie had potential it really did those you who aren't fans and see this movie you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga so don't watch the movie first people who saw and liked the anime manga don't get your hopes up on this one studies show you most likely will be disappointed it was still fun to see the anime come to life in the live action adaptation but it could have been so much more br br reluctantly i give the live action a 2 out of 5 br br as says i'm sorry br br
<START> i usually have a difficult time watching a tv movie the extra long commercial breaks will break my concentration and i give up and find a good book this one however made me put up with the adds and stay with it to the end i realize the movie was based on a true story but it was not brought out why it took so long to find <UNK> they had his name and i would presume his social security number while he did move around a lot it would seem he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job etc the actors seemed a bit old for the part and a buried metal object when <UNK> up had no <UNK> these were only technical <UNK> and did not take from the file for a lifetime movie it was better than most
<START> ugh yes it's exactly like the mess or the horrific <UNK> in washington in the movie the mother keeps <UNK> questioning her little boy over and over and over until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear the court <UNK> and <UNK> repeat the pattern the questioning itself is sexually creepy a <UNK> repeated assault in its own way br br the <UNK> throw in a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse maybe to justify the film's point of view that two to four year olds never make things like this up well they will if every adult they know is asking them to the way this piece <UNK> such <UNK> <UNK> techniques makes watching it an exercise in frustration for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful <UNK> in real life br br they also add a special arrest incident towards the end to prove their case no parallel to this fictional incident ever occurred in real life can't say more here without turning this into a spoiler but you'll know it when you see it br br yes children are abused sometimes by paid care <UNK> but to watch a movie which <UNK> the ludicrous hysterical <UNK> against so many totally innocent people to watch re creations of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children as well as the lives of the accused i didn't think i'd last until the end it's just too sad and made more so by the writing <UNK> seeming <UNK> of the abusive paranoid questioning techniques that started what can we call it the <UNK> of the br br no one i know has ever been accused of child abuse thank heaven but my 12 times over great grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed for it <UNK> filled with what they think is holy anger are just as dangerous now as three hundred years ago sensational drivel like this these <UNK> of satanic abuse are <UNK> up all over the country there must be something there so tell the jury that just eggs them on br br and whoever thought it was a good idea to have kids under ten some of them under five play these roles it's traumatic to watch them delivering their lines how much more traumatic was it to act these parts the commitment to fight child abuse apparently doesn't apply to themselves and what were the child actors' parents thinking melinda uncredited at least in the version on the a e network in 2005 but i think it was <UNK> and teddy brian <UNK> were terrific professionals or not though they were too young to be exposed to this material much less to be paid to act it out despite <UNK> <UNK> these real life children do you know the <UNK> man got an emmy nomination for directing which just goes to show how crazed things were back in 1989
<START> low budget horror movie if you don't raise your expectations too high you'll probably enjoy this little flick beginning and end are pretty good middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot quite a bit of gore i enjoyed bill performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening nurse charlotte <UNK> played by jesse lee played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end she makes some really stupid mistakes but then that's what makes these low budget movies so good i would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave if you enjoy this movie try committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie
<START> little did i know that when i signed up the the all pay channel package with direct tv that i would face a movie like this it came on right after another movie we had been watching and i was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where i was at the time but i missed this movie br br i also can't believe we left it on it is kind of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s but i think even then this would have been a painful movie it was just well too cute et was cute in a way but not <UNK> cute and stupid br br when i see a movie like this i come on onto imdb to see what others say i am blown away that this thing was nominated wow the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s oh well it did show some old actors btw that is the other thing i was surprised about the <UNK> not a bunch of no names but some real actors actresses must have been in their drug days anyways odd interesting bizarre and makes one happy they grew up
<START> after reading some of these reviews it is apparent that some have missed the point what is great about this film here comes the point what is incredible about this film what is astonishing about this film is that there is no <UNK> there is no preaching there is no preaching there is no preaching life goes on it is a masterpiece in letting an audience think for its collective self these are just kids doing what kids do without consciousness we all went to school with kids like these we are being <UNK> by fiction movie tv news based reality invention br br dennis hopper the great girlfriend alone and his relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie br br there have been few movies before or since that measure up to the intelligence of this film <UNK> br br
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 <UNK> international film festival br br this film had been compared in the program to <UNK> which i liked so i was quite looking forward to this movie i also liked garden state <UNK> dynamite etc so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american <UNK> films br br unfortunately i found that <UNK> chair does not compare <UNK> with any of these movies br br i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing witty insightful or even mildly interesting to happen it didn't and the shaky video <UNK> was making me sick so i left br br this is only the second film i have ever walked out from the first was <UNK> which is slightly disappointing i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the <UNK> picture but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything br br disappointing
<START> i've seen this movie at least 8 times and i still laugh every time the movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man against all odds can cheat the entire over self confident system br br this movie is for all people who like a funny movie br br the action and comedy is well mixed into a brilliant film that i hope to see on dvd soon br br
<START> i agree with all aforementioned comments this show was a delight to watch funny witty terrific acting and zany sets it's always a thrill to find a show that is <UNK> written assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor i would spend good hard earned cash money to see it again on dvd and as long as we're <UNK> smart series that never got a chance how about dvd releases of maximum bob another well written odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters and add to the list middle ages or <UNK> place there has to a way to release these shows out of the <UNK> and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences
<START> there are times when less than halfway through a movie i start to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to burn every reel of footage and instead release a movie that has no real merit of any kind and i mean any kind this movie doesn't even hold up as made for cable porn in fact <UNK> tears is completely and utterly boring and at times a bit disturbing in its <UNK> the girl who is as i recall <UNK> <UNK> while thinking of an older nazi who hit her with a car the <UNK> into her in the hall as a way of introducing ourselves syndrome from sitcoms and robert films then on their second or third meeting get this he is the shy one the one who is <UNK> to the girl's sexual advances and yet all she has to say is i'm old enough i'm want to and he takes her to bed then after sleeping with this girl he hardly knows he feels completed as if he could die right there in the bed with her and he'd have lived a full life it's like <UNK> without a shred of social and personal commentary br br the cinematography is the most boring part of the movie no interesting angles or originality at all not even for the sex scenes which are supposed to be the main draw for these kinds of movies the masturbation scene is just a camera <UNK> the girl's bed very fake looking as if it's on a stage and it's with her fantasy of the man taking a shower in a <UNK> the i am completed scene is just a close up of the girl's right side head down to her breasts with the guy on top of her and it's the same shot for the whole time even though there are <UNK> cuts to a fairly unrelated scene of the <UNK> older sister who has some kind of incestuous crush on him she's ridiculous and silly so it doesn't matter i think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes and it's neither <UNK> nor <UNK>
<START> i've always enjoyed frank sinatra's music and just recently i wrote a term paper about his life story i've been fascinated by the life and legend of ol' blue eyes however i've never seen any of his movies so i wanted to see if his acting was as great as his singing well it was i was blown away by his performance in this movie he really does a tremendous job as recovering heroin addict frankie machine who's trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band br br otto <UNK> direction is great as well i haven't seen any of his other movies i read his biography on the imdb he seems like one of those directors who was sorely misunderstood and people had conflicted thoughts about him seems like the kind of person who appeals most to cult <UNK> i haven't seen enough of his films to know for sure if he's really brilliant but now i'm curious i want to see more of his films because judging by his attempt with the man with the golden arm this guy has talent i also loved the music for this movie the score definitely contains the kind of music that i'll remember if i ever happen to hear it again that's when you know you have a great score br br the supporting performances are fine as well including darren <UNK> as the local drug <UNK> <UNK> parker as <UNK> wheelchair bound wife and kim novak as his lover br br it's interesting to see how filmmakers handled the subject of drug abuse as opposed to modern attempts in films like <UNK> and <UNK> for a dream back in 1955 just mentioning the word drugs caused controversy and if you watch the film they kept the subject on a very <UNK> level there's only one scene where frankie is actually getting heroin <UNK> into his arm and they showed a close up of the reaction of his face rather than showing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into his <UNK> but it delivered its message without making it feel watered down in a powerful drama like this with powerful performances and direction like this you don't need graphic portrayals of drug abuse to keep the audience intrigued br br the man with the golden arm is a dramatic gem that all film buffs should check out it really is an amazing piece of work br br my score 8 out of 10
<START> this film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to the <UNK> along with another couple and the family dog when they first get there they are not welcomed by the <UNK> gas attendant that <UNK> them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week after with the old man three also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and <UNK> them to leave after asking some of the local <UNK> that can't speak or just don't want to answer they find the cabin after they settle in strange things happen to the <UNK> including discovering crap on their car the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer <UNK> at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end adding a church group did not make the story any better then at the end the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun lame thats what this movie is
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> movie is the first film i have seen of cult swedish director roy he is a veteran filmmaker who has made his living filming commercials directing only four feature films in the last forty years this background shows the film seems like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials there is no story <UNK> these vignettes though some characters appear in more than one <UNK> there is a theme throughout underneath them though the absurdity of modern life some of the film's mannerisms having the actors appear in light white makeup are more irritating than <UNK> some of the skits amount to very little a man unsure in which <UNK> to stand other skits are better though the best is the one about the rock chick dreaming that she goes on honeymoon with her rock <UNK> bride on a house that turns on something akin to a train you have to watch it to get it a film worth seeing even if comparisons made by some film critics with such great filmmakers as keaton <UNK> and seems overwrought lacks the vision of them and the lack of a story <UNK> the vignettes is fatal to this film's <UNK> of being a masterpiece
<START> i saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the <UNK> video nasty list and while i'm glad i saw it because it's now <UNK> video nasty <UNK> on its own merits andy <UNK> film really isn't worth bothering with there are of course far worse films on the infamous list but that doesn't make the pain of viewing this one any easier the film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget and that has translated into the script as blood <UNK> works on an idea often seen in horror cinema and doesn't do anything new with it basically the plot <UNK> on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will it's not long before they start getting picked off blah blah blah for most of the film nothing happens and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned they're so amateurish and silly that they're impossible to take seriously on any level it's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture it all <UNK> down to a <UNK> tedious ending which also succeeds in being a non event of epic proportions apparently this movie is still banned here in the uk but somehow i doubt it's because of its shock value basically blood <UNK> isn't worth seeing and i personally can see no reason to recommend it unless of course you've made it your business to see everything on the video nasty list
<START> the fact that reviewers feel very intensely negative towards the show is an interesting fact all its own if you dislike it so much don't watch it br br certain reviewers <UNK> that you have to be dumb dim witted or plain old primitive to enjoy this show <UNK> <UNK> my friends i am not claiming that all the contestants are smart there are smart ones and there are dumb ones but i would argue that they probably have a higher average iq than the average reviewer on this website thats right i said it there is a lot to be said for the science of <UNK> girls i'm sorry but please <UNK> all sticks out of your <UNK> and realize the reason you hate these guys is that they <UNK> you br br those oblivious to social <UNK> and more specifically the science behind <UNK> are clearly going to miss the boat completely br br one thing is clear the <UNK> aren't the only places to meet girls i personally think that the worthwhile women don't even go to <UNK> so that they won't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show but what are men like these apart from the ones whose games stink they are the epitome of men they are men who meet women in the most difficult situations these are men who take <UNK> of their own sexuality these men don't beg for their girlfriends to not break up with them and these men don't say ok to the phrase let's just be friends br br sound familiar in fact these are the very guys you're afraid of when you take your special long term girlfriend to the club we all are these guys know what women like again only the ones who have game br br and even the ones who are bad they are worth a laugh br br if you have gone out to a club and actually <UNK> with the people around you you should find this show entertaining br br look i am at a loss for why there is so much hate for this show my best guess is that it <UNK> the <UNK> in men who have had bad experiences in <UNK> or threatens men who believe women are beautiful self less creatures who just want a nice guy to buy their attention br br i personally love this show it is pure entertainment and best of all its real it is a very <UNK> take on the most recent state of sexual psychology sex roles have never been so different from before and this show provides a very real view of that br br i think it actually takes some intelligence to take away something positive from this show br br this show appeals to a certain target market and if you're outside of that then i guess you shouldn't tune in to the show we could say this about any other shows though couldn't we br br grow up br br
<START> if you're coming to this film to learn something about depression forget it you won't learn anything except how not to write a screenplay on the subject i understand the intent was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck but the result is the most one dimensional character i've ever seen in a hollywood feature no small feat christina <UNK> as elizabeth spends the entirety of this film screaming at the top of her <UNK> <UNK> insulting someone <UNK> into tears or some combination of the three the only exceptions being some quiet <UNK> at the beginning and end there is not the slightest hint of what she might be like without depression not the <UNK> <UNK> of any other aspects of her personality she just screams at one point her roommate tells her <UNK> you're such a fun person to be around when you're not being depressed and my reaction was she is it seemed odd that the writers would include this comment without giving us any examples but this script is a lesson in incompetence it has no discernible structure or flow at all instead it consists of a series of <UNK> strung together scenes of <UNK> screaming then ends character development no scenes of her everyday existence i e going to classes that might possibly be important details no screaming at maximum volume check it's not quite enough i'm afraid 1 10
<START> i <UNK> watching this program as a young boy in australia in the 60s and enjoyed it on dvd again as a 50 year old father of young kids although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a <UNK> of violence i am very happy to have my 6 and 8 year old kids watch this because the central characters are deep kind and <UNK> the japanese culture shines through the violence is not gory nobody <UNK> in it and the program is beautiful to watch it does not promote nightmares but instead it shows much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of jedi knights in star wars br br the quality of the dvds does leave something to be desired video will not like this one it is strongly reminiscent of something held on <UNK> film and projected onto the wall in some basement which it may well be the soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have come to expect from home theatre however my kids noticed only that it was not in colour and i suspect they only noticed that because we had been talking recently about how old things are often like that the beauty of <UNK> <UNK> is evident even in b w something about the <UNK> century setting makes the quality part of the atmosphere as if you <UNK> into the past through some time window br br overall this program is better than most things on the air and a far better <UNK> for japanese tv than pokemon but you may consider it of <UNK> value if you did not have the experience of seeing it back in the 60s my score of 8 10 takes its age into account
<START> ok the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem i e the story started out in life as material for buster keaton's silent classic 7 chances comedy or acting in any genre for that much is merely <UNK> a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before if it's not a totally original creation here we have the stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget short time span of a film they're handling things just fine regardless of what the credits say on their films real <UNK> <UNK> know that they had a lot of <UNK> on lines and direction they took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation words spoken by <UNK> <UNK> himself during a documentary about the boys here what appears to be their usual <UNK> over something so simple as getting married is actually organized chaos every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action how many comedians are around today that can claim such <UNK> most obviously the seinfeld crew but none others that i've seen in the last 35 years of watching tv the critics will always <UNK> <UNK> the stooges or laurel hardy and others but then again who ever remembers the <UNK> names or what they said simply watch laugh and enjoy
<START> i saw this movie one time at a kiddie <UNK> at the north park theater in san diego in 1959 when it was released and i was 11 it was one of three features that were shown that day br br i have not seen it since but have wanted to because i am a film buff and appreciate the terrible along with the great good and average films br br what i remember most vividly is that the more sophisticated audience members <UNK> of children between 8 and 15 <UNK> with laughter at the tree monster br br a triple bill at a theater showing 3 adventure films is something an 11 year old does not forget but i can't remember the names of the other 2 films one did star george <UNK> and david <UNK> br br update the other 2 films in this triple bill were much better they were 1959 with george <UNK> and david <UNK> starring and the angry red planet 1959 with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hayden staring ms hayden has written a couple of books on health and <UNK> also
<START> ho <UNK> more of nothing if you are a long time rush fan you know what this video contains <UNK> songs from the past the big 3 hits from the 80's and their last <UNK> efforts to remain contemporary they do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as dinosaurs unfortunately they fail at protecting themselves from embarrassment close ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys have been br br if you are have been following as much as you can stomach the band for a couple of decades from the 70's then you know there is no new material here same old same old 1 neil avoids the press 2 no real behind the scenes <UNK> <UNK> his shoes give me a break even he thinks it's absurd 3 no new insights br br a better video would have been to show the crew setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run and stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy but then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the viewer can choose we know what the band looks like  let us see what we really want to see br br do yourself a big favor rent this movie first
<START> they are good stand up comedians young not ugly have money the girls love them the audience is <UNK> everything there doing br br and then they made this film br br no story at all some jokes were old in the fifties the acting is awful save your money for something useful like a gift for your girlfriend
<START> a plane carrying employees of a large <UNK> firm including the daughter goes down in thick forest in the pacific <UNK> when the search and rescue mission is called off the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lance <UNK> puts together a small <UNK> group to <UNK> their own search and rescue mission but just what is <UNK> searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods br br <UNK> what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance <UNK> who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and they're probably both writer director <UNK> fault this film which i'll be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing i've ever seen next to alone in the dark 2005 and constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay let's try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other <UNK> non <UNK> and generally try to be as annoying as possible br br the potential was there despite the rip off aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to <UNK> the blair witch project 1999 and any material related to the titular monster was <UNK> predator 1987 ed wood like exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for <UNK> and far less <UNK> <UNK> the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types <UNK> through the woods could have been great if and fellow writer chris would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships the <UNK> <UNK> had some nice production design specifically the corpse <UNK> ala a more primitive <UNK> <UNK> 2001 if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective br br but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of <UNK> made for some reason thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so on br br for some reason he thinks it's a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an <UNK> amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway br br for some reason he doesn't care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes we're shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and we're stuck with far too many pointless scenes br br for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because it's not that important the <UNK> intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another way br br for some reason there is a whole character mary <UNK> left in the script even though she's superfluous br br for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft core porno scene even though the <UNK> is never repeated again br br for some reason characters keep calling <UNK> <UNK> mr h like they're stereotypes of asian br br for some reason insists on using the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesn't look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle <UNK> or anything else other than bad cinematography br br i could go on but you get the idea br br i really wanted to like this film better than i a <UNK> fan i'm intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love <UNK> and this is basically a <UNK> film on one level but i just couldn't every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end made some other awful move in the end my score was a 3 out of 10
<START> first of all those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film even those like me who are <UNK> to most <UNK> violent and sexual acts in movies should beware i'm not telling you to steer away from the film but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material definitely not a pleasing film to watch but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value but i must admit when i watched the film for a second time i had to skip to the next chapter when the razor blade scene came up br br the main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters i can think of but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act in one scene she <UNK> broken glass in one of her <UNK> jacket pocket after being <UNK> with her apparently <UNK> performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience the student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood <UNK> hand next to the razor blade scene that disturbed me most the <UNK> mother is not much more sympathetic than she when she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an br br though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part i felt more needed to be explained about isabelle <UNK> character when a woman is fascinated by <UNK> porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself you want to understand the root of the problem the movie <UNK> that she wants desperately to be loved then why the hateful attitude towards everyone why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain br br the acting is terrific and i liked the glossy stylized lighting altogether it's not a film i'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained but as i said it's very intriguing and i'm sure if i watched it a few more times i'd be able to spot certain subtleties that'll shed more light on aspects of the film i didn't realize initially br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> this film shows just how much fun filmmaking can be it's all in good fun as it plays out a no holds <UNK> comedy assault on the star trek genre in <UNK> trek the <UNK> a group of good <UNK> boys are on a mission to stop a group of <UNK> cats out to destroy the entire redneck <UNK> br br can captain jerk stop the villainous <UNK> with the power of the r s s and it's cow ray she may have nine lives but he has ten bullets this cult classic previously only seen at scifi conventions is a party favorite lots of funny moments
<START> i can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film so i must be in the minority for liking this film so much well i am right and everyone else is wrong just kidding i guess i like it because i am a psychology teacher and i really liked the brooding character played by ryan while he truly is dangerous as well as very menacing you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma and wow did ryan do a really good job portraying this man you really find yourself feeling for <UNK> <UNK> as he destroys her life so with such intense acting and menace why is the movie rated relatively low well probably because it isn't exactly believable but boy is it entertaining and creative give it a try and don't believe the score of 6 4 it's a lot better than that
<START> after looking for this for months and then accidentally buying it cheap it was disappointing i heard about it on a dvd r site and it sounded crazy br br but no what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fu ing wasn't too bad but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie seem really really long much longer then it's 85 minute runtime br br on a positive note the ape was funny for a couple of seconds especially when i think they took the only close up of it's face from another movie and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said which <UNK> made all black people look like complete <UNK> br br but it wasn't enough sadly br br 4 10
<START> this movie is just downright horrible the movie was only an hour long and for about <UNK> of the movie was just useless random clips that don't even connect to the movie the storyline is completely <UNK> my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script i don't understand how someone could <UNK> the production of a film like this horrible this is definitely the most horrid movie i've ever seen in my entire existence i think the casting director just took some random kids from off the street to act in this movie the directing acting producing and writing for this film are all really bad i feel bad for the people who wasted money funding this garbage u couldn't pay me to watch this crap again
<START> the <UNK> is a well thought out well produced film that will draw the viewer into the story directly and keep them involved to the very end granted it is not in the same vein as under siege et al but this is definitely the trademark film of what might be described as <UNK> second era of films not so much action movies with a nod to a story thrown in for good measure but a good story matched with a point and <UNK> with some of <UNK> action sequences is this the kind of film that hardcore action <UNK> will enjoy probably not but for those of us who not only like our action but also can appreciate a well told story this is a big step forward for seagal it's almost like the transformation clint eastwood made as he tried to step out from underneath the shadow of his dirty harry series either man had he continued in the <UNK> direction they were headed would have forever been in in specific role and guaranteed the <UNK> of their careers
<START> well 1st off i haven't seen silence of the <UNK> yet but i think that i would have become sick if i would have seen it before this piece not from the gruesome violence but from the lack of everything else anthony hopkins was very good as <UNK> and i really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but from the reaction of the audience around me the film was filled with cliches from silence which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen br br now i heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out he did it but only in 2 sequences i mean if you want it to be gruesome and i mean so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that you need more than 2 sequences i always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will take you to another place and time or either go over the top which most of the time is done in bad taste but this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times br br anthony hopkins and <UNK> moore are the stars of the movie right well with the exception of hopkins i didn't feel that way who cared about the stupid italian police officer i <UNK> didn't so really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway i mean come on who cares br br in a nutshell the movie is good if you want to see <UNK> and <UNK> once again but if you're going for a really good thriller you'll jump once and be <UNK> out maybe twice depends on your level br br thinking about how much money this movie will bring in there will probably be another <UNK> made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall if you must see it wait and save the 3 50 4 00 and get it on video don't spend the big bucks on this film
<START> i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election <UNK> last shot at throwing a dig at bush this movie was just awful yet i'm still watching it minor spoiler i think cbs got the same people who provided the to do the semi cut in half sequence what is with the bad boyfriend storyline can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a ed wood movie who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing if you want to see decent b grade disaster movies then see <UNK> <UNK> etc avoid this mess of a movie hint to cbs avoid showing us this crap give us re runs of <UNK> instead better acting and more believable
<START> <UNK> was shown at the washington <UNK> <UNK> april 15 2005 the director was there to give a short introduction and answer questions afterwards br br as always i think <UNK> did a fantastic job i can understand those who think she should be been more aggressive or more bitchy but would that really be realistic in <UNK> possible maybe realistic i'm not so sure i think her interpretation was valid although there could certainly be other ways to do it br br i hate to use the word but this was the most <UNK> of the indian movies i have seen so far i know a fair amount of indian history <UNK> religion etc but the level of detail here was far beyond me clearly you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were <UNK> familiar with <UNK> and its customs <UNK> as they were c <UNK> i missed a lot of things one of them being the fact that the mother in law would want in the house as sort of a counter weight to her daughter in law br br spoilers had several things to say that explained the movie much better for me first the original version was 20 minutes longer so what was left out apparently three main things a beginning segment where <UNK> leaves e <UNK> for <UNK> according to the director different characters are speaking w vs e setting up some of the political comments later of course all of this is lost in the hindi version and certainly to a non indian like me it wouldn't have <UNK> anyway but a set up of the situation sure would have next there was a segment where was writing a poem a sign of her independence etc finally some more business about the <UNK> so although some people think it was too long i think the original longer version would have been <UNK> br br the women's hair was apparently another sign again the mother in law had short hair short hair for <UNK> <UNK> her sister also a widow had longer hair more modern and of course <UNK> had extremely long <UNK> length hair <UNK> of status of <UNK> br br the ending really threw me all of a sudden who had never had a political thought is writing a political <UNK> <UNK> explained that he was in <UNK> at a film festival when the subtitles were done the subtitles use the word country throughout letter gosh said a more appropriate word would have been i forget his exact word something like self or independence she was talking about her own <UNK> and finding herself not about <UNK> india and the british so why does just disappear the day after finding again apparently because during her stay on the she realizes that she doesn't need a man any man to define complete her she can just be herself so she rejects who she threw herself at a few months before and just goes off of course i'm not sure how she buys her next meal but that's another question br br the red <UNK> again she buys represents revolution as well as passion i'm not 100 sure why she puts the <UNK> on the dying woman but perhaps she is <UNK> passion revolution the <UNK> which uses throughout the movie to watch and the boat on the etc she is being a <UNK> to see a life she <UNK> for but can't have at the end i missed this she leaves the <UNK> on the table with the letter showing that she doesn't need them any more she's going off to lead her own life br br finally the <UNK> quote at the beginning saying how he <UNK> for the ending apparently <UNK> wrote this as a serial <UNK> his readers with the sexy widow bits but at the end he sold out to <UNK> and had <UNK> down at the feet of and begging their forgiveness one of his students wrote to <UNK> taking him to task for his sell out ending and <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> for the ending in the movie of course goes in the other direction
<START> the captain and have released a very good 3 dvd package with minimal editing unlike most variety show releases these shows have not been <UNK> to bits the musical and dance numbers are included with the skits just as they were when first broadcast i suspect that some musical numbers on the dvd may have been edited into shows in which they did not originally appear but have been unable to <UNK> that suspicion i've noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the dvd and program information i've found on the net i've been unable to <UNK> whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd whatever the truth may be i'm very <UNK> of the efforts made by the production company i wish every variety show released would show the same respect for the format i would guess about half the shows broadcast are included i believe they ran into rights problems on the shows which weren't included hopefully those issues can be resolved and a volume 2 can be released sometime in the future there are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras i recommend this dvd to any c t fan
<START> i know it sounds crazy but yes i am a huge fan of house party 1 and 2 and proud of it i hated part 3 and then here comes part 4 i was like are you kidding me with this kid <UNK> play are nowhere to be found in this movie and that would've been okay had they not <UNK> entitled the movie house party 4 as if it was in any way shape form or fashion related to its predecessors every time this movie comes on late at night on usa i shoot my tv with a rifle quite frankly it really is just that atrocious <UNK> br br as the only remaining fan of kid <UNK> play that will actually admit to being a fan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i was appalled remember that stupid little boy group immature they <UNK> their way into house party 3 okay fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3 confused house party fans do yourself a favor and stick to house party 1 and 2 and class act beyond that everything else is ridiculous
<START> so seagal plays a <UNK> detective named john <UNK> who lost his partner on a drug investigation into surprise surprise <UNK> not to <UNK> or anything but my father was born and raised in <UNK> hence my last name and now he's a doctor in california so no matter what the movies would have you believe there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of <UNK> br br at any rate in a drug bust gone bad <UNK> loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked <UNK> prostitute inspiring him to go to confession somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies before or since it was actually pretty interesting seagal has a tendency to come off as almost <UNK> the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt whether by a stripper or by a lover never the slightest bit of interest from him he's all get the bad guys all the time br br but in the confession booth he <UNK> to having <UNK> sold drugs evidence and even slept with <UNK> in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars i hope i'm not getting in trouble with god by telling you the priest tells him to go to his family so he decides it's time to <UNK> from the force br br the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper thin characterization characteristic of <UNK> films marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of <UNK> <UNK> drug dealers and these guys have no <UNK> about pushing their products in broad daylight br br <UNK> goes back to visit his old high school coach max a minimal effort by keith david and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread locked sitting right there in the <UNK> crack to some <UNK> looking high school girls br br maybe i just had a <UNK> experience in high school but i didn't know crack dealers and hung out at school in the middle of the day at any rate it's not long before <UNK> learns how evil these guys are they're not just crack to high school kids but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs they engage in stare downs with max and since that's not enough his 13 year old niece died in their br br ah ok we get the picture i'm sure they also torture <UNK> and beat up old women and maybe steal candy from children too just for good measure is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are 13 year old niece died in their wow br br anyway not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without <UNK> to what basically <UNK> down to movie name calling where evil deeds are <UNK> assigned to them through dialogue but they also don't know how they should act br br the leader of the drug dealers is named and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is is a cartoonish <UNK> man with these bright <UNK> green eyes which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half <UNK> out of his head his favorite means of <UNK> is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown <UNK> accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he's yelling at this guy likes to get so into <UNK> faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their <UNK> don't touch all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath br br man they do not want you to forget that these guys are <UNK> by the way their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it's nearly impossible to understand them not that it matters it doesn't matter what they're saying all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug related thing they're just the <UNK> that <UNK> drugs and kill people the movie must have been a huge hit in br br my biggest problem with the movie is that the <UNK> particularly of the bad guys as i've described are spectacularly goofy even for a seagal film they are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to take them as anything other than a <UNK> b movie creation something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can <UNK> his characteristic brand of <UNK> down <UNK> br br but there is also a bizarre kind of <UNK> in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird for example a <UNK> i guess you would call her at one point puts some kind of curse on by if i remember correctly spitting of onto a live <UNK> that's hanging upside down before <UNK> it and dripping its blood onto a picture of hmm interesting br br sadly it's this same woman that warns <UNK> that his family has been marked for death by these people meaning they've got some voodoo <UNK> on them not to <UNK> anyone but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that i would just laugh at it <UNK> doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo <UNK> br br but the set up as you can see is pretty standard for a seagal film unique villains i guess you could say although not very impressive definitely the <UNK> film of <UNK> early
<START> i first saw this film in the theater way back in the 40s when i was a kid and always remembered the ending there is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed something just <UNK> with them this is one of those films and i agree with another reviewer who said fritz lang should have directed more westerns to add to it i have always liked randolph scott and robert young in fact robert young stars in what i consider my favorite movie if i have to name just one not an easy thing to do that film is <UNK> passage it led me to the superb historical novels of kenneth roberts western union likewise led me to reading zane <UNK> novel which in this case turned out to be one of those rare cases where i like the movie better than the novel not that <UNK> novel is a bad one i just like the movie story better the movie in no way resembles the novel it is a completely different tale one of the biggest <UNK> from a book i have seen br br i can't add much to the other reviews except to say i agree with many of them i too wish it would be released on dvd whatever happened to randolph scott happened to the best of me
<START> good movie great story great characters i enjoyed it immensely enough to buy the dvd when it came out br br the real life story it <UNK> to tell is more fascinating and engrossing than anything the could ever come up with my friend who is in the media business said they shouldn't show <UNK> <UNK> like this it gives the business a bad name as if br br there are a few problems with the dvd though first the sound volume is awfully low so you have to run up the tv volume to watch it i notice that its also like that when hbo runs it so its in the original production copy second for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut off that is the picture is cut off about one inch short of the left side after the five minutes it fills the screen properly left to right sloppy technical production like that is very amateurish and i don't know why the director and producer let such <UNK> slide by br br still even with the technical flaws its an enjoyable story one of <UNK> best i think
<START> i loved this thing the most wonderful thing about pink <UNK> is that it <UNK> desperately to be in horrible taste but has really gained a cult following world wide says a lot about us us being people doesn't it pink <UNK> succeeds because waters made the film he wanted to make a film need not be disgusting to succeed but it may be when you watch this film you see things that are disgusting but are ultimately brilliant because they are <UNK> displayed what we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression everyone who ever cares to succeed as an artist be it in film or any other media should watch this film
<START> aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat this film rings true on the chaos of the post war br br beautiful photography and a powerful national expression of the polish national character br br it's very slow at points but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it's quite refreshing br br both lead actors do a very good job on the dvd version you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew and the lead actress has gained about 50 <UNK> and lost all of her beauty but in 1970 she was a <UNK>
<START> this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme <UNK> bad child actors and more feature <UNK> that's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans with many of the cast <UNK> that a football is shaped like a <UNK> what that's a <UNK> ball the story follows a group of no <UNK> that get a new teacher that they like who <UNK> teaches the class in a short <UNK> and gets them interested in football naturally they're all rubbish don't forget they're no <UNK> except for one kid who has moved from el <UNK> blah blah etc etc and the kids still don't become good but good heart ensues and the no <UNK> are turned into a bunch of well rounded kids hell even the adults start to come round <UNK> are turned into caring parents illegal immigrants are let off the hook <UNK> br br this movie stars steve <UNK> now before you go <UNK> off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy hold up a minute <UNK> is rubbish no no come on let's face it how did this guy ever get to be in a movie i have absolutely no idea and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea olivia <UNK> stars along side steve and doesn't impress either she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this most of them are disgusting and or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all there's a goat in the film who plays the <UNK> and he does a good job but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat so don't bother seeing this movie
<START> years ago i didn't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now i noticed that many of <UNK> films done with warner brothers in the 1930s lacked realism and his acting style was far from subtle however the more i watched these films the more i found i was hooked despite these aspects in fact i now kind of like and expect them fans of old time hollywood films probably understand what i am saying teens and other young <UNK> don't well when it comes to entertainment the mayor of hell never lets up from start to finish while the idea of a shady character like cagney played taking over running a <UNK> school is ridiculous and while all the changes he made also seemed far fetched it all somehow worked out and delivered solid entertainment br br the gang of tough thugs were pre dead end kids and instead of the likes of leo <UNK> <UNK> hall and billy similar roles are played here by frankie and <UNK> yes i did say <UNK> this black actor was already famous for his roles in the our gang comedies and was believe it or not one of the highest paid child actors in hollywood all he needed to give up in return was be named an insipid name and act like a nice stereotypical <UNK> here he actually was pretty good and the usual black stereotypes are a bit more subdued than usual however some will cringe at the very funny but horribly offensive court scene involving <UNK> and his dad fred with awful names like <UNK> and <UNK> don't say i didn't warn you br br apart from this small complaint and a plot that is tough to believe the film is exceptional and fun the kids do a great job as does cagney and dudley <UNK> in a truly despicable but exciting role as the evil warden also as an added plus you get to see <UNK> warner stock actor allen <UNK> in his first role for the studio
<START> all i can say is that each time i see <UNK> martin <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> i feel an <UNK> sense of inspiration and in what the power of cinema is possible in such a simple film br br the motion picture is set in 1969 it is based on a true story it is a story about a white man jon voight who teaches a group of young black children how incredible the world is outside of their little south <UNK> island br br the story places the job of a teacher as noble cause in changing children's lives br br i highly recommend it
<START> <UNK> finds out that he stands to <UNK> a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours considering how hideous he looks and his personality it isn't surprising that he can't get a taker that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his <UNK> at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new <UNK> plus the money of course br br while i don't hate the three stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion they never even on their best day came close to the brilliant comedy of buster keaton that's why i disliked this film as it was a ripoff of the plot from keaton's masterpiece seven chances with the stooges it wasn't <UNK> for columbia pictures to steal old comedy plots or just <UNK> older <UNK> shorts so from the outset this film is a pale imitation of an original it's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced the phone booth scene the cousin basil bit however was pretty cute and funny though far from subtle however the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion in the keaton version hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious here it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch ending in a <UNK> br br overall a dull <UNK> also before <UNK> this review not helpful be sure to first see seven chances to see what i am talking about then you decide
<START> great show about time a reality tv show comes along that <UNK> generation gaps contestants range in ages some seem old enough to have watched the movie when it first came out and others looked so young that perhaps parents or teachers handed down the movie hoping it would touch their lives the way it once touch them grease has truly become an american icon grease is a fun and entertaining movie in which the young and old can relate to you're the one that we want is sure to gain even more grease followers the only thing i wish there had been more of is character history then again it is kind of nice to leave some of it to the nostalgic imagination of the 50's cant wait to watch the next show and then on broadway
<START> i don't think the world was ready for this film i know i wasn't i'd been expected a standard low budget schlock exploitation <UNK> instead i got the most intelligent <UNK> of shakespeare since peter <UNK> <UNK> books this should become the definitive film version of romeo and juliet it won't of course but that's the world's loss
<START> i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme with reviewers either <UNK> a film to the <UNK> or <UNK> it to pieces i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to lightly the film is art house science fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot but is actually just a tiny part of a <UNK> <UNK> series of events which are never properly resolved i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be <UNK> fed a plot and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too <UNK> no the film is just terrible as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron <UNK> wooden acting and a <UNK> plot line avoid
<START> in 1990 i saw kathy ireland in person i was at in <UNK> during the filming of necessary <UNK> strangely enough the voice she's using in this film isn't too far off from her real speaking voice br br anyway the plot goes like this kathy gets a letter telling her that her father's fallen into a <UNK> pit in africa she goes and <UNK> the site of her father's death only to get sucked into a <UNK> world that's part <UNK> nightmare part uninspiring fantasy and inhabited by rejects from the this movie really wastes the talent of linda who in my opinion could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her anyway the main hero of the story gus is a very lame mark <UNK> jackson rip off the original is annoying enough to begin with but this guy really is torture to watch eventually the <UNK> <UNK> comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a at the end if you're going to have kathy ireland in a film in skimpy clothing it'd better be a bikini anyway the film was just all around bad and rightfully <UNK> by mst3k br br avoid this one if possible
<START> this one <UNK> produced by mgm in 1936 showcases the talents of two of its young stars under contract judy garland and deanna durbin in a way these short films were <UNK> trailers that featured new talent in front or behind the camera felix <UNK> directed this one which was a way to promote the two talented stars to the public br br the story is simple enough the orchestra that entertains in a public park every sunday doesn't get the attention it deserves enter two music <UNK> judy and <UNK> who love to hear the band play <UNK> by one of their <UNK> two of the town's <UNK> <UNK> there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to <UNK> their sunday <UNK> in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience br br the two girls <UNK> in a <UNK> tour of their own doing what they only know calling and running <UNK> and being helpful to their neighbors in exchange for a promise they will attend the park concert next sunday well that day comes and to their surprise hardly anyone comes as the music starts the two girls decide to take matters into their own and ask the conductor to play a song for them to sing the result is clear people all over the park <UNK> to hear the talented young singers thus <UNK> the <UNK> existence br br of course the only attraction of the short film is the inspired singing by the two stars who are wonderful in their rendition ms <UNK> operatic voice <UNK> well with ms <UNK> natural one creating a lovely <UNK> br br don't miss it whenever it shows on tcm
<START> chaplin enters the <UNK> of wwi in this spirited comedy that never <UNK> the horrors of war the rain the mud the explosions all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all he's in france for one thing to fight the germans something he does with unbelievable success br br it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin a very funny one at that until the final minute when it rises to a new level of <UNK> and everything makes sense br br perhaps it's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war
<START> <UNK> johnson divine lives in a trailer with her son <UNK> her daughter <UNK> and her mother edie edie massey she's in competition with a couple named connie and raymond <UNK> <UNK> stole david to be named the <UNK> person alive the film shows their attempts to <UNK> each other br br this film is very much not for everyone it's a in your face no holds <UNK> assault in bad taste <UNK> has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches the <UNK> pick up female <UNK> <UNK> them keep them <UNK> in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples divine and family have a party which includes <UNK> etc etc it's disgusting but in a way not unwatchable it's so over the top and is so <UNK> about it that it's kind of fascinating as director john waters might say it's bad taste done well also it's kind of amusing to watch the acting is so wretched especially by massey that you just watch it in disbelief a friend laughed out loud at how bad massey was she improved in later pictures br br this is not for people who are easily offended even though it's over 30 years old it's still shocking however if you have an open mind and can take a lot of extreme behaviour this is a must see the only part that really was too much is what divine does at the very end
<START> i have to admit that out of the many many thriller movies i have seen this has to be one of the worst i was shocked to discover that this piece of work had a 1 5 <UNK> budget when it started i thought that the opening sequence was pretty good fairly standard for this kind of film but pretty good anyway but as the film progressed i began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace that i was seeing each sequence seemed to take hours the reason for this could have been that by now the film had already bored me to tears nothing was happening other than endless <UNK> <UNK> with confusing flashbacks and the occasional fit of bad temper well after <UNK> through what felt like a lifetime of these scenes we finally reached the big finale an all singing all dancing <UNK> of how lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good film br br overall i found this movie predictable and tedious and i would not recommend this film to anyone other than those people i personally dislike but if you have a couple of hours to waste and you want to watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary this is the movie for you
<START> if you liked lock stock and two smoking <UNK> the chances are you'll like this too although i guess a few of the british in jokes like calling two london characters dixon and after <UNK> soccer players may be lost on some this is still cracking entertainment which <UNK> with <UNK> br br <UNK> miller and tyler are all excellent bringing depth to their characters and the interplay between the two protagonists is always well judged in fact scott's direction is very assured considering that this is his first feature film and proves that he has his father's talent for putting us at ease in unfamiliar surroundings br br hell i've convinced myself i'm gonna see it again
<START> terrible terrible movie for television once again lifetime brings us the predictable triangle scheming bitchy woman out to get stupid <UNK> wife of yet another stupid husband who doesn't have a clue br br i get <UNK> when i see these films you may ask why do i watch them then i haven't a clue usually by mistake and the movie is so bad i can't get away from it i wait for the bitch to get her come up <UNK> and usually i'm not satisfied in how she gets her just <UNK> br br now if you can believe our <UNK> she steals <UNK> from the clinic and how does one do that without blood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> she proceeds to kill the <UNK> <UNK> rose who is on to her in broad daylight in the front yard of a house for sale and no one sees her she kills the mother susan hogan and you could predict that <UNK> when the mother off <UNK> mentions she's <UNK> to <UNK> and that the <UNK> to combat this <UNK> are in her pocket book guess what i won't continue on this br br finally you are left in the house alone with the wife and the bitch well good <UNK> evil but much too slowly victoria <UNK> as the evil girlfriend is adequate in the role looking a bit too <UNK> and obvious <UNK> spelling just stands around looking blank most of the time she's got those big big bette davis eyes that look like they're popping out of her head i liked her better in trick and plays the husband going around <UNK> his wife there's nothing too he and his ex girlfriend even though he's spotted all over town being very <UNK> with her standing half naked with her in his house when he sent the wife off to the city to stay overnight yet he continues to deny the romance br br lifetime never disappoints the viewers with their inane plots and stories about women and their stupid husbands wish i could give this <UNK> a 0 rating
<START> where do i begin the story was so bad it must have been written in a high school film club the acting was so wooden i felt sorry for the actors one actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a <UNK> <UNK> another actor has this constant look of being <UNK> but it was the dialog that takes the cake br br our hero says to his <UNK> all holding <UNK> guns if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead moments later the strongest guard built like a truck and the only women prisoner go at it when our <UNK> leader who has this very annoying <UNK> gangster voice catches wind of this <UNK> he <UNK> walks up to the guard while machine guns are trained on him and in a split second <UNK> this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick he then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing but essentially yell at him br br i could go on and on this movie is camp gem and if you have any sense of humor it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear
<START> i decided to hire out this movie along with a few other old horror movies this was the worst some of the killings were good and <UNK> a bit of humour but i <UNK> stand this <UNK> a killing happened they would show scenes of all these old movies that the killer used to be in i give this 2 10
<START> upon <UNK> this <UNK> piece of trash a friend and i <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> never to again speak of how we had just <UNK> away the last 90 minutes of our lives this film is completely pointless a two dimensional hero and heroin who we can't give a hoot whether or not they survive and some of the <UNK> villains to ever <UNK> the screen of horror or any other genre to further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was i would have liked to add a plot synopsis but i can't write fiction all and all the only reason i can think of that anyone would ever want to view this film is if they had just murdered their entire community and is looking for some self <UNK> punishment that will haunt you for all following years to come

<START> this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named from age 8 through to <UNK> told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life so for example when he's eight it's the eight year <UNK> voice that is doing the narration when he's in junior high it's that one doing the narration etc that's about the only interesting thing about this movie it looks like each actor playing is a separate character not only do they not look alike their life experiences don't seem to match up br br avoid this movie like a bad cold
<START> it's easy to see why many people consider in the mood for love to be wong <UNK> <UNK> best film the toned down appeal of the film <UNK> on the studied view of a relationship put through an emotional <UNK> is a <UNK> into happy together territory but without the hyper <UNK> <UNK> of jarring film <UNK> and hyper <UNK> sequences that have become a trademark of <UNK> <UNK> films since <UNK> express like <UNK> the <UNK> this is a different kind of <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> where dialogue and plot are <UNK> by mood and composition in order to create a tale of two delicate lives in a seemingly <UNK> emotional <UNK> br br it's a testament to the genius of <UNK> <UNK> that he is capable to making such a simple tale so <UNK> <UNK> mo wan tony <UNK> and <UNK> li <UNK> maggie cheung move in next door to each other within the same apartment building he's a journalist who dreams of <UNK> martial arts novels and she is a secretary at a <UNK> company their eventual <UNK> is obvious from the beginning but the pleasure here is the way that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> paints such a journey with his grand br br the key to the success of the film is <UNK> <UNK> use of the interior space playing with <UNK> and background planes in ways that are similar to the works of polanski during the <UNK> first half of the film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and cheung within shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible <UNK> <UNK> is concerned with environment and space here creating a <UNK> emotional dynamic between his characters it's also telling that <UNK> <UNK> never chooses to focus on the <UNK> of mo wan and li <UNK> their <UNK> partners are <UNK> absent from the film as they are <UNK> to their own love affairs with each other br br this is not to suggest that in the mood for love is a <UNK> experience because <UNK> <UNK> manages to his film with broad <UNK> of hypnotic camera movement and sound there is one shot where <UNK> slow sensual rise up a <UNK> <UNK> turns into <UNK> descent down the very same <UNK> their movements perfectly compliment each other <UNK> the shot and creating a sense of erotic <UNK> between the two figures their souls have connected but they have yet to physically <UNK> the erotic <UNK> of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating as two star crossed lovers reject physical <UNK> due to their humble <UNK> br br other scenes in the film are <UNK> with brief slow motion shots of cheung <UNK> moving through her interior surroundings set to mike <UNK> beautiful score <UNK> dresses beautifully compliment her exterior space as she moves slowly through her surroundings her movements slowly build up to what seems to be an inevitable <UNK> between li and her dream lover even though the seduction process seems to be entirely sub conscious br br if i make it seem that these two characters are more like two birds <UNK> on each other it probably isn't that far fetched of a statement the tight bond these two characters have with their internal spaces is almost as intense as their relationship to the <UNK> the film rarely moves into an exterior space and when the camera does it is usually to peak through <UNK> windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like confined animals <UNK> <UNK> continues to <UNK> us even when the lovers get close enough to touch shattering the <UNK> <UNK> to each other by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps within <UNK> of clothing located inside of a closet mother nature even seems to respond to their love lust often <UNK> a soft <UNK> of rain over the characters after their bodies have near each other br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> atmospheric shots of a <UNK> allowed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to experience a <UNK> release in happy together even if leslie <UNK> ho <UNK> wing was not there to enjoy it with him by that film's end love was so <UNK> bound to the act of war that a third man's muted <UNK> of love <UNK> <UNK> realization that his dreams of seeing a <UNK> would bring him inner peace even if it would not bring him back his lover mo <UNK> journey <UNK> within the confines of a <UNK> temple his own emotional <UNK> is <UNK> nicely with the political climate of his country and the absence of li is only made tolerable by the fact that <UNK> <UNK> allows mo wan to experience a release of sorts mo wan <UNK> to an ancient myth and his <UNK> release into a crack in the temple leaves him capable of living his days with the hope that all his loss and <UNK> somehow served a higher purpose
<START> this one is a real stinker br br the story just isn't up to par with most other <UNK> episodes it's pretty boring though seeing peter falk made up as a <UNK> castro <UNK> is kind of amusing br br whenever twilight zone would be aired at an <UNK> hour in my hometown i'd grab a <UNK> and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment 9 times out of 10 it wound up being this episode strange thing this often happened to my mom another <UNK> fan like me as well there were so many times that one of us would say to the other i was all set to watch the twilight zone and guess which episode was on the cuban dictator episode obviously some people like this episode as it gets a 6 7 rating how that happened i have no idea but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot
<START> so me and my friend are <UNK> our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with eternal sunshine of the <UNK> mind so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three this is scarecrow gone wild now both of us had seen to the first two scarecrows so we felt <UNK> to finish the job let's start with the cover of the dvd first first we notice a picture of ken <UNK> the world's most dangerous man on the cover apparently he was used to market the movie as the lead actor by the way he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very scantily clad woman in the middle ground of the cover i can assure you that she is not in the movie at all at the time of rental we assumed that this was to <UNK> the fact that the scarecrow was going wild in the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out in the ocean i can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie at all looking back me and my friend should have known something was up i mean really who the heck puts a carnival on an island now on to the actual movie we start when a young man is inexplicably <UNK> to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field don't ask me how they were <UNK> but think of when brandon lee waking up from the dead in the crow it's just that stupid but in the <UNK> defense he has gone wild <UNK> the scarecrow who now lives <UNK> through the young man takes a trip to his local beach to those who had done him wrong because yes in the world of the scarecrow <UNK> are conveniently located in the same general <UNK> as <UNK> to make a long story short the scarecrow kills all who stand in his path without any warning except for the <UNK> trademark <UNK> that <UNK> a <UNK> this is however rather impossible to believe because the <UNK> mouth is clearly <UNK> shut several tracking shots that would make kubrick roll over in his grave later and we have one of the worst third <UNK> in a series ever well except for maybe the third matrix as joel <UNK> would say this scarecrow is wildly bad
<START> usually i'm the one <UNK> the twenty something <UNK> for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t <UNK> <UNK> and car chases however in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those <UNK> at least i wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels br br i don't mind surreal and i certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning but there should be some point to the whole thing i didn't get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were instead just so self absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered or perhaps they just got confused themselves either way i don't care it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace br br although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited <UNK> about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography i must <UNK> disagree perhaps i didn't <UNK> through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere <UNK> br br or perhaps this movie was just crap br br i give it a 1 and file it next to <UNK>
<START> big spoiler this is a terrible movie with no likable characters so many clichés and senseless scenes it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left please save your two hours the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself the description read moments of dark comedy perhaps i missed those when i <UNK> the horrible characters start right with the funeral the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide then the father makes <UNK> at the only son left right at the funeral how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with <UNK> <UNK> character is the bad guy for telling the husband the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great <UNK> the movie tries to <UNK> every dramatic cliché possible into one movie father over driving athletic son to succeed dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide the son left feeling lost and alone drugs marital affairs child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son incest homosexual <UNK> bullies possible <UNK> illness etc etc etc do not waste your 2 hours
<START> this film screened at the american <UNK> egyptian theatre in hollywood on april 7 1999 it was described in the american <UNK> schedule as follows br br tomorrow is another day 1951 <UNK> 90 min steve an ex con who's never been with a woman ruth roman is a dime a dance dame with no use for sappy men a hotel room a dirty cop a <UNK> the perfect jump off for a <UNK> on the run love story this virtually unknown noir is felix <UNK> <UNK> packed with <UNK> set pieces <UNK> was never more vulnerable roman never <UNK> imagine gun crazy scripted by it's that good br br i just saw this film and i agree with every word of the above description
<START> terror in the <UNK> might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has in fact very few to offer granted it presents a decent and versatile too versatile selection of horror thriller <UNK> that are considered classic but what's the point this documentary primarily aims for the horror loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already haven't we the only thing really <UNK> about this project is the editing if you're into scream queens chases by vile murderers and that sort of things terror in the <UNK> has some neat <UNK> of the most famous sequences all these different scenes hang together by a lame <UNK> story starring donald <UNK> and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater in between two sequences the address the viewer and explain why we love horror so much those speeches naturally are <UNK> and rather obvious it's in our nature to be afraid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i fail to understand why many people love the concept this is worth a <UNK> in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing on the contrary in case you still have to see a classic genre title beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known but fundamental foreign titles endlessly focusing on halloween this does result in a cool inside joke however when donald <UNK> screams to the screen at his own character
<START> with the exception of the main character the acting didn't convince me but the story was quite good it's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon <UNK> as you can imagine such a relationship is quite <UNK> the movie is very american and as such has some <UNK> undertones to <UNK> its criticism of religious <UNK> but some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague do you believe in god and he answers mean other than madonna all in all the film is not one of my all time favorites but the script is really good and i really liked it it's entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and <UNK> i think this is an important message in our times since i rated films that i liked less with 9 this is clearly a 10 for me some people may find this exaggerated but i think this film deserves it
<START> what a waste of precious time my 5 year old daughter brought this home from my mother's house and we watched it as a family none of us liked it this wretched little film <UNK> with glaring inconsistencies overt christian themes and horrible film quality is not worth watching even on a dare it felt a bit like a bad high school drama class attempt at film making how sad to see talented actors chris <UNK> gary busey and company <UNK> their way through this trite and insipid storyline the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute the film can should have gone straight to the pound avoid this film your time is better spent watching paint dry
<START> i've got to say i'm a big fan of these <UNK> house on the <UNK> rip offs even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high <UNK> by me but one of these sorts of films that i didn't like much was <UNK> <UNK> train and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left don't mix as terror express is another <UNK> rip off something that this sort of film really needs is a <UNK> nasty lead character and while terror express offers up three potential candidates not one of them steps up and becomes this villain leaving the lacking in the most important area it actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board this leads the audience to believe that there is more in store but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set from there the trio end up <UNK> <UNK> the train and use their new found power to <UNK> the guests and rape the women br br it has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film which will be pleasing to many viewers but there's hardly any blood director seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes and he may have gotten away with it too if he could film a brutal sex scene the idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex as the people that you would expect to be powerful and <UNK> seem all too keen to show their women a good time and despite one very tame sequence none of the sex is particularly interesting since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes this becomes a massive problem films like this are often lacking in style suspense and credibility but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you as you might expect none of the acting is up to anything and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish the direction is lacking in style and there's very little tension or suspense making it difficult to care what is going to happen overall this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film and i can't recommend it
<START> just got back from seeing black snake <UNK> i had spent time reading reviews most seemed to focus on the obvious skinny white girl <UNK> to a black man's <UNK> i hate when critics miss the point of a film now i suppose it helps that i live in <UNK> and have lived in <UNK> a couple of times too it may also help that i am the former director of the <UNK> blues museum in but i get this movie simple redemption tale is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story but i believe it is highly effect as a blues it would be my hope that people don't read all the hype and or various reviews and miss a really good movie get past the various things like skinny girls in white <UNK> get past justin timberlake accept his character which he plays very well get past snakes on a plane and see how samuel l jackson is as he has transformed himself into a very believable mid south blues man if you know little about mid south culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish but accept the fact that craig <UNK> knows how to paint the <UNK> and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film not one to tell endings so go see this movie and yes i will agree with one thing the critics got right the music is wonderful
<START> pure crap decent cinematography i liked some of colors other than that this was one of the worst movies i ever saw boring lifeless not once did i find myself interested in any of the characters i kept waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace nothing ever happened i think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot there was a movie being made at the time
<START> this was a great movie for being only <UNK> minutes long there was an aspect of film noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged even the dialogue was good along with the acting it reminded me of what was to come in <UNK> by not being in <UNK> order i liked how the main character tried to use what <UNK> taught him for example saying everyone has a box which he put his personal things into also on the writer's door was the batman <UNK> which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight two other great movies there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it even though i kind of figured what would happen when <UNK> gave the young man d credit card i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by <UNK> one of my favorite philosophical books this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it plus it only being an hour long there is also a <UNK> aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant
<START> watching the first few moments you realize it's going to be a parody and certainly it is a parody but i'm not sure of what a fairy tale an opera a <UNK> c movie if there was something like that and i can assure you it's not worth watching it's simply a pointless film <UNK> a good parody is everything but pointless with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely <UNK> characters it's like a <UNK> or better it's like a <UNK> <UNK> and the score sung in an intentionally incompetent way something <UNK> will use much more <UNK> it is painful to listen to unless one wears some <UNK> of the art <UNK> haha go for quality movies e g a how <UNK> peter the great married off his <UNK> 1976 and steer clear of this mistake
<START> john <UNK> must have been insane if he thinks this was a funny movie i laughed more times watching remains of the day pathetic plot unbearable acting horrible music michael is a maniac
<START> wow this movie was really bad you talk about formulaic typical movie plot watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed the plot twist at the end where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected but doesn't make much sense until his monologue even then the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either are all of those images necessary my last complaint is about the <UNK> of <UNK> of the movie would the <UNK> really send a lone officer into an warehouse subway tunnel or wherever to find a body when the location of the <UNK> is unknown and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could don't waste your time seeing this piece of something
<START> saw this on french tv today and was most disappointed the film starts off reasonably well but nothing is <UNK> and at the end we are no <UNK> forward than in the beginning as to seeing the husband for the murder of his wife this is just not plausible you need <UNK> proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence in this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible remember the old <UNK> innocent until proved guilty the fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her so i really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make the outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible no <UNK> evidence is revealed to the <UNK> so quite frankly viewing it is a complete waste of time after all a film must be entertaining this is completely untrue in the case of this one and i suggest it be <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> where it belongs
<START> i had high hopes going to see this as i always enjoy paul <UNK> performances i thought he was very good as <UNK> and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with br br <UNK> book on the origin of species was one of the most ground breaking controversial and innovative <UNK> ever yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie it's like a two hour episode of a soap opera in a victorian setting there is virtually nothing about <UNK> five year voyage on the to the <UNK> islands for example surely of supreme significance to the story as it was from his <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> that he began to form his theory of evolution br br this is just one long dreary domestic drama with <UNK> portrayed as a slightly <UNK> eccentric seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally <UNK> wife jennifer <UNK> portrayal of emma <UNK> is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical <UNK> of the real emma there could have been an opportunity here to present the interpretation of life on earth from either emma or from the local priest as played by jeremy northam a blink and you'd miss it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor to act as a <UNK> to <UNK> views but it wasn't taken up br br the story focused too much on endless <UNK> sentiment about <UNK> grief for his daughter annie and too much time was also wasted in <UNK> wondering whether or not to write his book eventually i was so bored it was difficult to care br br all in all this was a bit like making a movie about <UNK> and spending two hours <UNK> on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist
<START> the movie <UNK> is one of the funniest movies of all time it features the cast from the movies and also has a great soundtrack if you have seen any or <UNK> la <UNK> you will notice that everybody from those two are in it including parents and many other people br br the story is about ryan <UNK> girlfriend jennifer cheating on him and him trying to get back at her he does this by having <UNK> and <UNK> her house there are many different characters with many different stories br br there is great music on the soundtrack bands such as him her kill daniel <UNK> and the stooges pop and new order br br if you do not like <UNK> la <UNK> or the movies i doubt you will like this if you do like that stuff this movie is great
<START> i saw this on tcm recently and through the imdb i found that there were seven crime doctor movies with warner <UNK> as the psychiatrist detective <UNK> is a bit long in the tooth compared to his <UNK> performance in <UNK> street a decade earlier not noir and a bit campy today the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural the plot black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the mr <UNK> and charlie chan series there are subplots unexpected twists and appearances by a number of b movie we all should recognize immediately none ever made it to the a status it is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes br br i would love to see a <UNK> dvd series of these films
<START> spoilers sorry the first word that <UNK> to mind whilst watching the film is <UNK> it's the only <UNK> movie i have seen from the four movies but i enjoyed it it wasn't too complicated as i hadn't seen the past two but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same br br <UNK> starts with a man his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation although it turns out that they end up at their own home which i have no idea what the hell went on the girl meets up with a boy played by leo <UNK> and they go hang out in a nearby forest they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the <UNK> he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation i would not speak to him the <UNK> steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic the <UNK> eat stuff in the kitchen spoof of the <UNK> kitchen scene and i can't remember not a good thing but i'm sure they have to go back for something someone anyway they end up getting out and saved the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two <UNK> he is told he can't because they are <UNK> and so he sends them home br br the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off it's a thrilling exciting movie worth a watch but if you're looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the <UNK> movies sorry
<START> not a box office success no one really knows why it may have failed simply because of its title it looks as though you need a two word tough guy title to attract a sufficient <UNK> of the idiot crowd die hard lethal weapon hard weapon die lethal etc talking about the long kiss <UNK> will get you nowhere but for once <UNK> <UNK> has made a good action movie a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character samantha earns our affection and interest early on as she becomes <UNK> again we're torn we certainly want <UNK> to <UNK> the bad guys and all that but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so even though we like <UNK> too <UNK> davis all of her considerable charm on both <UNK> of the central character samuel l jackson plays second <UNK> for a change it turns out he's good at it that was a compliment br br intelligent far superior to anything in the die hard series if i were more cynical i'd add it's not surprising that it didn't do well but i don't really feel that way it is surprising that it didn't do well
<START> i came across this movie on tv i hadn't heard of it before and almost changed the channel but it quickly hooked me br br the story of the struggle of the <UNK> people against a military <UNK> was provoking the level of brutality that some are willing to use to hold onto power is hard to believe it makes me thankful to live in a country where the government isn't likely to shoot people in the streets br br the story of laura <UNK> was a good thread to hold the story of political struggle together
<START> i saw this film for one reason the <UNK> is upset the <UNK> and you're dead cracking it's not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box but it <UNK> a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters an eagle eyed human radar a huge and a big <UNK> sexual <UNK> are all mind controlled by a huge head in a chair who's not happy about his family being <UNK> by a murderous <UNK> this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you <UNK> ignore the giant head
<START> this is a great installment in the child's play series it brought back some bang to the series great comedy boy this movie is funny also there are awesome <UNK> to other horror <UNK> beautiful cinematography great ending bring on seed of <UNK>
<START> this is another alien imitation and not a very good one at that replace outer space with the south african desert throw in the same ingredients a group of people stranded in an <UNK> landscape have them hunted down by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very ordinary film trying to ape a classic film a group of <UNK> and scientists go on a hunt for some missing colleagues and find their bones in the desert stripped clean of flesh their vehicle breaks down and they head for <UNK> while being stalked by the monster the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it there is a vain attempt to build up the tension but i found this didn't really work and made the film rather boring the creature didn't appear much and when it did it didn't really <UNK> a feeling of horror there is one scene where someone gets the flesh ripped from his arm but that was basically it on the gore front in conclusion i found this film about as exciting as watching paint dry i give this film 4 10 and that is only because of the interesting location which alone isn't enough to save this movie from being a total <UNK> fest
<START> i a huge fan of when it comes to doctor who series and still am but i was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series br br children under the age of 15 or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series but as far as fans of the original series will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great it took david <UNK> to get me to appreciate how much better <UNK> was as a doctor in the 1st season br br i would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series people who are under 15 and extremely die hard who fans everyone else will just get a laugh and <UNK> curse words about <UNK> t davies screwed up one of our favorite tv shows
<START> let me just start out by saying that tourist trap is a better movie then 99 9 of the horror films that have come out of hollywood lately if you don't believe me see darkness falls or they and it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like stab bleed the pool and so on one of the big problems with the film tourist trap is that is never really found an audience when the film opened in 1979 it was given a pg rating by the mpaa anyone that knows horror films knows that a pg on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film director david <UNK> talks about this problem on the dvd's commentary track there are exceptions though like <UNK> which had also received a pg rating however there are big differences between tourist trap and <UNK> tourist trap was not a big budget hollywood film like <UNK> nor was it produced by steven spielberg that alone was enough to guarantee <UNK> success still for those of you that have seen tourist trap you will even scratch your head as to why the mpaa rated this film pg the <UNK> scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and r rating or how about the <UNK> in the back with the blood running out of it i have to admit though that when i was young i looked at a copy of <UNK> in the video store shelf picked it up saw that it was rated pg and put it back on the shelf in favor of an r rated film instead years later i finally saw <UNK> and realized what a great film i missed out on for not renting a pg horror film from then on i would never judge a film based on it's rating again this is most likely what happened to tourist trap people like me with <UNK> will probably overlook it in favor of the r rated film most likely it would be a teenager too which most of these types of films are targeted at friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated r and was heavily advertised by paramount at the time it found its audience and made enough money to <UNK> several sequels when you look at it folks tourist trap is just as good as friday the 13th the same thing could've happened to tourist trap we could have seen tourist trap 2 3 4 and so on as far as the film goes tourist trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget but it is well acted well directed and well made on many levels chuck <UNK> is a riot as mr and gives the best performance in the film special credit must be give to composer <UNK> <UNK> whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness the music in the scenes involving the <UNK> is especially creepy <UNK> worked on the horror film carrie and many other film scores since tourist trap he has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day the weakness with tourist trap is that there really is never any explanation of powers maybe that is how it's supposed to be he just has them and we should accept that in order for the movie to work we do accept it to a point but then the screenplay has incidents like how makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house in that case is limited in using his powers can he make a phone ring in <UNK> detroit los angeles what is his range those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws others would accept it as a mistake i accept it there is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it this is a horror film we should not be required to read too much into it many people have called this the <UNK> movie i assure you that no <UNK> kills anyone in this film the <UNK> are controlled by the power of who uses them as a weapon this is a common <UNK> about this film some people have a problem with the <UNK> and some have even said they are just downright silly i think they add to the overall creepiness of the film overall tourist trap is a good fun rental out of 5
<START> i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it i have e <UNK> film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's i have had no <UNK> and it still hasn't been repeated the performances are superb the film has everything its funny sad disturbing exciting and totally takes you back to school days it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific i also cannot hear the song <UNK> by cream and not think of this film this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb channel four please show again or release on video or dvd
<START> i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life this movie was terrible i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars the acting is absolutely terrible this movie is a travesty based on the classic the most dangerous game if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like <UNK> at least j lo provides some better scenery ben should <UNK> the ladies viewing it i'm not upset about the 7 i paid to see the move i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back br br can you give me my time back samuel l jackson changing <UNK>
<START> <UNK> 4 starts i quote <UNK> in kansas a replay of the last few minutes of <UNK> 3 1991 as the recurring character of charlie <UNK> don keith is about to shoot the last two remaining <UNK> eggs in the universe which we are informed would mean the <UNK> of the entire <UNK> race which is against some sort of <UNK> <UNK> law or something like that charlie's bounty hunter friend <UNK> <UNK> mann is now known as <UNK> is a top <UNK> official at the <UNK> <UNK> orders charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a <UNK> that will land nearby very soon the <UNK> does indeed land nearby very quickly charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the <UNK> which i presume ally <UNK> him as it's never really explained <UNK> 4 then informs us that we are <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> where a salvage ship comes across the <UNK> <UNK> in space the credits have barely finished <UNK> 4 is already stealing entire ideas scenes from aliens 1986 rick <UNK> decides to claim the <UNK> to them anyway <UNK> try make a bit of cash out of it with the help of his crew ethan paul <UNK> angela <UNK> al bert brad <UNK> <UNK> eric the <UNK> is successfully <UNK> they get in touch with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> say to go to an abandoned space station where a trade will be made for the <UNK> it's <UNK> also specifically tells rick not to open the <UNK> so in true horror film tradition rick opens the <UNK> <UNK> charlie out the <UNK> eggs which <UNK> kill rick escape into the space station br br co produced directed by rupert harvey i thought <UNK> 4 was a pretty useless film rounds the <UNK> series of films off with a <UNK> rather than a bang the script by joseph <UNK> david j is both predictable clichéd the space station with an unstable <UNK> that will blow up in a few hours the protagonists only means of escape being early on so they are stuck the race against time to save themselves the constant <UNK> arguing amongst the crew people splitting up the loser who turns into a hero saves the day yawn a lot of plot devices seem to come straight from aliens it rips off star wars 1979 with a tacky waste <UNK> scene the characters are no better you probably won't give a damn about any of them while the other <UNK> films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot it appears to be deadly serious throughout <UNK> 4 is also incredibly slow <UNK> dull it's over 30 minutes before the <UNK> eggs <UNK> after this brief sequence it's nearly the hour mark before their seen again why make a <UNK> film barely feature them it can't be because of the expensive special effects as they look like <UNK> puppets anyway oh how can a mere hours old <UNK> operate an entire space station set a course for earth how do they even know what earth is why did rick want to open the <UNK> anyway what is all that stuff about with the female scientist a rubber alien thing that is mentioned only once why do the <UNK> <UNK> want the <UNK> so badly why only send four men why is this perfectly good looking space station totally deserted again <UNK> 4 looks cheap throughout with bland dark unimaginative sets it even steals footage from <UNK> 1983 for it's ships space scenes <UNK> 4 was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any <UNK> effects the ones it takes from <UNK> look seriously dated for the most part only two <UNK> are used although some more start to <UNK> but it's pretty late in the day when this happens for most of the film they are barely seen the effects for them are the worst of the entire series forget about any blood or gore as the <UNK> only kill two people during the 90 plus minute running time which just wasn't enough to maintain my interest the acting is pretty poor as well with angela over the top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few <UNK> eggs particularly cringe worthy to look at <UNK> 4 it is as cheap <UNK> a production as you could hope to not see the ending of <UNK> 4 has the universe finally being saved form the <UNK> menace lets hope it also saves us our local video stores from the menace of a part 5
<START> this movie is based on the book a many thing by han and <UNK> issues of race relations between <UNK> and whites a topic that comes from <UNK> personal experiences as an <UNK> growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time br br other than that the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the <UNK> of communism in <UNK> china william <UNK> never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn <UNK> in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are <UNK> inclined br br the cinematography really brings out hong kong especially the <UNK> <UNK> the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is a real tear <UNK> some may consider sentimental romances <UNK> but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is a shining example
<START> after watching this movie once it quickly became one of my favorites as different events happen in the movie you change your mind about back and forth until the end and even after the movie is very thought provoking and a must watch
<START> i'm <UNK> my brain but i can't seem to think of another movie quite like the valley of the <UNK> a western with dinosaurs what could be more natural you gotta wonder why john ford and or john wayne never tried it br br the plot  while searching for a mythical <UNK> horse for her circus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> and the rest of the cast characters enter a strange lost valley there they find not only the <UNK> horse but some other more <UNK> creatures as well dinosaurs rule this place now wouldn't that be an attraction at circus  a <UNK> t rex br br it's not that i find the valley of the <UNK> a bad movie i just don't seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie there are some parts that i actually find almost unwatchable for the first half of the movie there just doesn't seem to be much going on i wasn't necessarily bored but i did want something to happen plodding would be an <UNK> i would use to top it off the movie features a very contrived love story it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together but the valley of the <UNK> isn't a total waste there are moments i really enjoyed who doesn't get a kick out of the scenes of the <UNK> on <UNK> trying to <UNK> a t rex you just don't see stuff like that every day ray creatures are impressive there are some really cool shots of <UNK> <UNK> with people and horses it might not represent the best of his work but the effects are very nice still at least in my mind these good moments aren't enough to overcome the <UNK> as much as i hate to do it i've got to rate the valley of the <UNK> a 4 10
<START> i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie it has set the standard i will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one i fully agree with the other comments about this film but since i'm dutch i watched it with dutch translation apparently they didn't have money for a proper translation so they decided to <UNK> it with sometimes hilarious results br br don't smoke don't drink don't do drugs don't watch demon summer br br i was surprised that the actors wow i can't believe i just said that didn't hold the script was there any in their hands while shooting i think they also did a good job on well no they didn't do a good job at all
<START> the real life case of an innocent first nations chief the indian by an <UNK> city officer the cowboy is the basis of this tv movie the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada a small scale martin <UNK> king thing the of first nations people is becoming a <UNK> in the canadian cinema <UNK> what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions the father played by gordon demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric demands justice the stars gordon and adam beach have minor almost cameo appearances soon to be star eric makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance an <UNK> mention goes to veteran actor gary <UNK> who has <UNK> up over 100 movies to his credit his portrayal of the troubled soul inspector was worthy of a award the canadian emmy along with eric the special effects jump cuts dream sequences are occasional and not overbearing couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience
<START> a brazilian cable television is presenting this month in its cult channel i saw the trailer and listened to the <UNK> and decided to see this movie indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless <UNK> crap about the conflict in the middle east and together with they certainly are the worst movies i have tried to see i really wasted forty three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap highly <UNK> for torturing enemies how can this movie be awarded and nominated to <UNK> <UNK> in cannes my vote is one awful br br title brazil divine <UNK>
<START> ok normally i am fascinated by z movies some of the actors directors writers etc in those movies have a shred of talent they want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them they have to associate with crappy people to make their films but some z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them br br not here br br as soon as i saw it i thought <UNK> a blade knock off ' believe me if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie br br instead i was subjected to some of the most horrible acting i have ever seen in my life master <UNK> was bad so bad that i believe some of my <UNK> in my brain <UNK> trying to comprehend his acting i am still trying to make sense of his <UNK> and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words to add dramatic effect i'm sure but it was for no apparent reason simply mind <UNK> br br oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting br br the main hero and the main villain did decent jobs the main hero derek washington seemed like he actually knew martial arts
<START> i remember this film of old it's a great chilling atmospheric horror picture about a man who moves into a scottish castle only to discover that there are strange goings on in the corridors at night and there are even stranger events taking place out back in hollywood's most familiar <UNK> <UNK> yes this is the <UNK> you've seen in every feature length film that ever involved a <UNK> puzzle up to and including the shining but the punchline to this story is about the last thing you would guess i certainly didn't see it coming this is a fine example of how good and convincing a movie can be even when the premise is utterly <UNK> <UNK> on laughable i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> this was <UNK> first completed project in over ten years the film takes place in the 13th century during an invasion of russian by germans <UNK> knights i think released in 1938 its a very loose parallel to <UNK> <UNK> involvement in wwii and <UNK> <UNK> into eastern europe there are some incredible scenes most notable the battle near the end of the film and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a pit of fire but its not an easy watch the film drags and isn't as consistently brilliant as <UNK> or <UNK> the terrible sometimes <UNK> is better in clips his brilliance is present however and its a must see for <UNK> fans and film historians russian propaganda at its finest
<START> even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue his career <UNK> will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was errol flynn i'm not sure he ever even went back to australia after his <UNK> success in captain blood still i <UNK> this film to the well known aussie <UNK> for <UNK> the reputation of one of their own br br part of the problem in telling errol <UNK> life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his <UNK> my wicked wicked ways i could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book br br his mother's infidelity to his father was not written but could have been <UNK> in reading my wicked wicked ways he didn't particularly like the woman that is clear from a few sources br br i wish the film had dealt more with his new guinea adventures that to me was the most interesting part of my wicked wicked ways as for his street fighting in the depression i tend to <UNK> that even if he had been successful at it i guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man br br still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of sydney during the depression was captured well and guy <UNK> is a charismatic errol flynn american audiences know him best as the uptight but honest lieutenant in la <UNK> which came out the same year as flynn br br but la <UNK> was a far better film
<START> the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless br br stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet <UNK> set design that goes out of its way to market <UNK> <UNK> i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch which has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much it's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to <UNK> it br br you want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
<START> i'm not the type of person to watch t v shows because the acting normally sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic but this show is perfect everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations everyone has their own personality and <UNK> is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation seem a little funny <UNK> <UNK> is a good role model for all girls she takes pride in wanting to attend <UNK> and boys boyfriends always come second in her book she's a loyal friend and always the peace maker there's subtle romance which is what i like personally not the <UNK> <UNK> romance that not many people get to have in their lives but a realistic type of romance every character eventually gets it and they don't find their prince charming at first glance and they don't just fall in love with every guy that comes their way it's a realistic show but when you watch it you better brush up on your movies pop culture and random facts because <UNK> is always making references i fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance so will you
<START> this picture doesn't have any big explosions or expensive chase sequences however it does have really wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts this at the top of my indie must see list taylor <UNK> and james <UNK> are terrific together the young cast surprised me with really consistent acting usually indie pictures have some weak link but there are no weak <UNK> here impressive go get this one
<START> i remember watching this film as a kid and i was in complete awe of it i couldn't take my eyes of the television this movie has it all for horror fans this movie had no funny moments expect a couple of one liners by <UNK> who was my favorite character in the film kevin <UNK> directed this jewel and did a wonderful job with a low budget i thought the end was awesome the only thing that could stop them was by surviving the night they were <UNK> killing machines the effects done by steve johnson we're excellent i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a love for low budget horror movies because as the old saying goes they don't make them like this anymore the sequels were pretty good too but not as good as good as the original this is a must have in any horror collection buy it if you can find it you won't be disappointed
<START> this is the best french movie of the year i saw it twice and i found it great both times i didn't think it boring at all even though it is very long 3 hours i'm <UNK> so i obviously didn't get to live the events of may 1968 that marked an extremely important turn in french history but it doesn't really matter since i still really enjoyed the film it's actually quite universal people of my parents' age can identify to the characters and so can people my age <UNK> seems to perfectly understand young people the way they think and the complications of love as well as the loss of <UNK> concerning the possibility of changing the world maybe that's because the character played by louis <UNK> his son is actually meant to represent <UNK> <UNK> himself well anyway great movie no action have to be honest on that point but so strong feelings that you can't possibly stay indifferent to it if you're looking for a relaxing sunday evening movie don't waste your time on this you'll be disappointed but if you like cinema you'll like les <UNK> which is a <UNK> movie close to those made in the 50's and 60's by the <UNK> vague artists
<START> i saw this movie today opened yesterday here and was simply delighted br br i saw a review that said something to the effect that the reviewer thought this would be just another teen movie but then found it was based on shakespeare's <UNK> night and then started trying to justify liking this flick on shakespearean grounds i really think this is going way overboard the only connections i could see with <UNK> night are a the basic <UNK> of a girl <UNK> as a man b the extensive male female humor <UNK> out of that basic <UNK> and c some of the names including <UNK> duke br br aside from those names the <UNK> a b are really great themes for any script and this movie's script is no exception beyond that though this really is a simply delightful and very contemporary traditional teen flick and that's a perfectly <UNK> genre even if <UNK> have to find an excuse to like it like <UNK> to shakespeare br br the movie is bright fast paced <UNK> stylized funny full of teen <UNK> and teen humor and male female humor suitable for all ages and that's really the best part imho really just about every male stereotype and every female stereotype is depicted in <UNK> appealing over the top fun those stereotypes are <UNK> relentlessly but <UNK> with such a complexity of invention that i'm still a little <UNK> but really don't feel at all disappointed in that regard it's not that kind of a movie things come at you fast and fun and you get a laugh and a <UNK> and then move on to the next split second happening br br amanda <UNK> really is just delightful as <UNK> sebastian <UNK> <UNK> makes a wonderful duke david cross does a wonderfully over the top principal gold all of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target cinematography was excellent br br wonderful entertainment from beginning to end check it out
<START> i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film <UNK> <UNK> guy <UNK> hugo <UNK> have all proved themselves as some of the best most capable actors around but i could not get into this i don't know if it's because i don't understand the lifestyle or what but i could not get my head around this film worse than anything is that the actors made some of the <UNK> drag queens i've ever seen i think that was part of the point i don't know i realize that is probably an insult but i don't know what else to call them i must say i bought the guys as the performers the correct term but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either i will say that i can't usually appreciate costume <UNK> very well although i notice them when they are wrong or out of place but i was very much impressed with these very creative to say the least just not attractive but i don't think they're supposed to be i don't know i am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers but i wouldn't go see ballet or opera either so i don't know if this is your kind of film then you will probably like it but if it's not skip it because it is well not for most of us i just checked it won the oscar for costume design i will say rightfully so i must say ebert didn't care much for this film either though he liked it better than i did
<START> since wesley snipes <UNK> or <UNK> to the world of <UNK> action movies the result has been miss so so and miss was weak 7 seconds was entertaining the <UNK> was the proverbial <UNK> of the <UNK> tank br br and what of the <UNK> we'll anything would be above suffering the <UNK> again but the <UNK> holds a small amount of merit that is <UNK> by a lazy star and low budget br br sonny griffith is a not so by the book <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> illegal arms dealers in <UNK> when his latest assignment ends up a bullet <UNK> leaving a pile of bodies sonny then is ordered to <UNK> a witness <UNK> the ever hot <UNK> to the us trouble is sonny is being <UNK> by a <UNK> in his own organization who is keeping his trail hot for gangsters with ambitions br br snipes delivers in the action department he is in half blade mode here he actually does well in the first 15 minutes of the <UNK> before <UNK> into pure <UNK> mode that ruined the <UNK> does more than look pretty there is some conviction to her scenes a lot of the actors look familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 seagal snipes movies its always good to see michael brandon again br br the action is <UNK> here but never boring running car chases fights director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems to have gotten better after the seagal farce out of reach he does a credible job but is constantly <UNK> by the low budget enough with the eastern euro locations its the movie's look cannot be that much expensive can it br br the <UNK> ends just average it does not have the so bad its fun aspect of <UNK> for justice but it is nowhere near as entertaining as van <UNK> second in command nor as thrilling as <UNK> <UNK> perhaps dolph should direct wesley next eh br br its high time the producers <UNK> a little more money and thought into these <UNK> titles with the kind of money they are making from them its only fair the result could be a high <UNK> perhaps br br snipes would be advised to try making this one his last <UNK> action flick its sad to see yet another waste of this gifted actor's talents
<START> the peace and beauty of <UNK> was a powerful <UNK> of the natural world in <UNK> we are <UNK> by images of the <UNK> the <UNK> the violent and the digital the destructive <UNK> of our culture br br some liberties are taken with the images with <UNK> and much slow motion the connections between the sequences are <UNK> if there are any <UNK> is defined at the film's end a missed opportunity to place the images in context br br the film is difficult to watch the quality of the <UNK> footage uneven and it's most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass
<START> another bad spanish picture this is very <UNK> i only save the photography and the music of <UNK> the rest of the film is the worst i've seen in years paz vega is horrible don't see it
<START> after the success of muppet babies warner brothers <UNK> up tiny <UNK> but instead of making bugs bunny <UNK> duck and all the rest of the looney <UNK> gang kids they created new animal characters who were kids with their own distinct personalities but personalities that nonetheless <UNK> their predecessors the leads included buster <UNK> bunny no relation which became their running gag or catch phrase <UNK> duck <UNK> pig <UNK> devil shirley <UNK> <UNK> montana max <UNK> the rats and <UNK> animals of <UNK> and the original looney <UNK> cast themselves the tiny <UNK> lived in <UNK> <UNK> and attended <UNK> where the looney <UNK> gang worked as teachers who served as <UNK> to the younger generation the ins and out of comedy br br during the show's run various pot shots were taken at the bush sr administration pop culture and coupled with various other gags and spoofs br br buster <UNK> arguably the show's main characters as mentioned above were similar to bugs bunny in some respects but they also had their own <UNK> personality <UNK> and comic styles namely <UNK> tendency to <UNK> anyone and everyone while buster capable of being a great goof himself usually played straight man or straight rabbit to <UNK> antics <UNK> duck was a virtual copy of <UNK> duck not screwball <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> with nearly as big an ego as <UNK> and just as much of an obsession with <UNK> the buster <UNK> as <UNK> had with <UNK> bugs though he usually fell flat on his face in his attempts yet he remained strangely endearing through out <UNK> was an even more shy version of <UNK> pig and he had the <UNK> job of playing <UNK> to <UNK> shirley the blond duck gal was a new age valley girl type whom <UNK> would go in and out of <UNK> of mocking or <UNK> for her affections <UNK> was the purple version of the <UNK> devil <UNK> was the silent <UNK> and was the pink bird there was also the purple female <UNK> who <UNK> for a boyfriend and the <UNK> sized versions of <UNK> <UNK> and the road runner evil was defined in the form of montana max a rich kid who was always out to make a buck or make people's lives miserable there was also a deranged animal lover whom everyone feared and then there was <UNK> an odd thing a ma gig creature who had no clearly <UNK> species except that he was from wacky land or something like that br br pop culture references included batman quite frequently actually michael jackson vanilla ice dances with wolves indiana jones star trek fast food <UNK> the ten <UNK> the twilight <UNK> saturday night live and even the simpsons among others br br not only funny but it also managed to be warm and touching something it's <UNK> <UNK> never quite <UNK> also followed by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> now i like johnny vegas which is a good start i also enjoy toilet humour br br such as young ones and bottom etc this however failed to bring even a br br small smile to my face the story follows johnny around after his wife br br <UNK> him out how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know br br as he attempts to <UNK> anything that moves failing normally i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste br br of my time altogether unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother br br
<START> i think category 6 day of destruction was very unrealistic the digital effects where like a children's cartoon br br the actors didn't act realistically for example when the girl was shot she acted like she got <UNK> <UNK> on her br br the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on br br the only interesting character was <UNK> tommy he was funny br br please keep the special effects real br br i liked the comment what did we do to p i s s off mother nature br br i don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines what else can i say the movie is so boring i think my comment will be equally boring
<START> this film held my interest enough to watch it several times the plot has holes but the lead performers make it work br br catherine mary stewart julia does a great job as a woman of <UNK> who has sacrificed everything else to become a <UNK> she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school she is performing brilliantly in her <UNK> and is just about to take her board <UNK> and realize her dream br br meanwhile <UNK> sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda <UNK> stewart to avoid having her become a ward of the state amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her <UNK> murder that she has become mute needless to say <UNK> 16 hour days get longer caring for amanda br br rob lowe plays kevin finney a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis <UNK> for julia br br the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and <UNK> was good as well <UNK> managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses br br we discover that <UNK> sister and brother in law the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype from their <UNK> they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the <UNK> julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed br br in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates the killers make no attempt to <UNK> the location of the from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave a living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to <UNK> the from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the location br br eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and <UNK> the bad guys the predictable ending has the three <UNK> a family and moving happily into a future together br br what struck me about the plot were major holes kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how does he know that the is not already in the hands of the killers the killers <UNK> leave <UNK> at the murder scene with no concern for <UNK> their identity the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the <UNK> of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention br br the film could have been a lot better if the script had been <UNK> more before filming filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort
<START> it's generally an accepted fact that marcel <UNK> 1936 1946 movies are masterpieces and it's considered polite to say that the rest are <UNK> this is an unfair opinion at least two of the latter era are <UNK> watchable his best post war work and les the <UNK> br br there's a strange evolution from the <UNK> golden hour to les in les <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> des <UNK> or le <UNK> se <UNK> true love is <UNK> by the villains in les true love does not exist anymore we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing falling in love would be <UNK> for this youth the adults are not the villains at all brother and mother are kind people but she is beyond their command very few grown ups appear anyway br br during two hours the characters do not stop playing around dancing listening to jazz records a music which was not still part of the <UNK> culture and heavily drinking when two of them discover they care for each others it will be too late br br the cast is rather good <UNK> as an <UNK> <UNK> and as a rich kid are the stand outs on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> and mainly jacques who married <UNK> <UNK> the same year as les do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for they are all smile too sweet and to nice to be believable br br oddly les was labeled <UNK> vague when you know what the priests of this cinema school the likes of godard thought of <UNK> it's really a good joke but this <UNK> you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing
<START> from a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values this one is definitely worthwhile this is the second bruce willis film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity off color humor profanity or gratuitous violence i refer of course to the sixth sense both movies are engaging on more than one level this one is appropriate for children as well although as others have pointed out it isn't a flick for kids br br i was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained except that we know russell himself <UNK> it as a 70 year old also why does his dying mother have to come to school to get him when he wins the fight why if as his older self says he has to fight that kid again and again for the next few years does his mother not have to come and get him every time and why he doesn't learn to kick butt in the process i also found the score rather annoying and not always appropriate to the action on stage br br good use of the red plane as metaphor however
<START> http video <UNK> com en distribution was tried br br we <UNK> for mass appeal br br we want the best possible viewing range so we <UNK> profit and continue our <UNK> labor jobs gladly to entertain you for working yours br br view texas tale please write about it if you like it or not if you like alex or not if you like texas or texas tale just write about it br br your opinion rules
<START> my husband and i both loved this film at first my husband was skeptical and asked how many points he got for sitting through this one but after a few key scenes he was totally sucked in and by the end he was convinced it was one of the best movies going kathleen bates has never been so wonderfully <UNK> and the rest of the cast is just simply fantastic thank you for this beautiful film
<START> rock <UNK> is not on its way to any <UNK> to <UNK> category as one of the best rock films of all time but it does make you from time to time because of its high level energy the film's theme is on a die hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band the story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band <UNK> priest if you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction then you got another thing however what did <UNK> me all night was the fine acting of jennifer aniston as the rock <UNK> devoted girlfriend i could not say the same about the rock star himself mark <UNK> was much better as a porn star than a rock star i did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie it reminded me of my teenage years where everything <UNK> like teen <UNK> i guess the film is worth a viewing but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some girls girls girls ' average
<START> i just cant see what everyone sees in this movie the acting is just awful the choice of music is mildly putting it peculiar there <UNK> enough fighting scenes the plot is non existent and whatever small entertainment one could get from this film is ruined by the annoying way some of the movie is filmed and gives you a splitting
<START> this person is a so called entertainer who has to resort to profanity <UNK> and <UNK> to try and make others believe he has talent i have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it it is a sign of a drug affected <UNK> mind makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse poor man i admit i could not watch all of it too stupid for words the amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a <UNK> no wonder self respect and decency are <UNK> and <UNK> is rising could it be that the might have been a factor in his <UNK> brain
<START> this is sweet the actress who played the nurse with the is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark another little <UNK> is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the <UNK> lady of roy in king pin this is most glorious story ever to be told it should sell more copies than the bible my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it the lady who gave the go ahead friend of the family was let go by the theater i was 3 years old i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd it's beautiful
<START> this movie was borderline in crude humor i utterly can not believe that these people can get away with this johnny <UNK> didn't cross the line he was <UNK> all over it this was better than the first all <UNK> way the thing i found about the 1st movie was that the <UNK> were somewhat as if it was on the t v show not this time they completely made a <UNK> degree flip the whole cast is so outstanding in what they do and not were the stunts crazy but the music basically fit every situation good work when you go see this be sure to use the bathroom before going to the theater maintain a strong stomach and to not let your <UNK> <UNK> out your nose
<START> i loved this film fantastically original and different a solid intense hard core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of dark humor if you're tired of the typical overdone ridiculous hollywood b s movies how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take then this film is for you fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable and solid performances by all actors not a weak character or performance in the film skip <UNK> film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film not a bad mix at all in my opinion this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go there's nothing boring or bubble <UNK> about this film the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it everyone i've recommended it to has <UNK> me and shared my opinion on it this film is a welcomed change alternative from the <UNK> hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today even with their big name actors big explosions special effects and huge budgets it's a <UNK> wild intense violent graphic humorous and raw i mean that in a good way no phony hollywood polish here ride thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen you did an incredible job
<START> previous reviewer <UNK> <UNK> gave a much better <UNK> of the film's plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually just gorgeous br br if you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art br br on a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give it about an 8 75 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then it's a 10 i definitely think it's a must see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 8 75
<START> i've never read a good review for vanity fair and i can't understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though admittedly <UNK> sharp is a better movie and <UNK> hopkins a better <UNK> there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9 10 at times myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch but at other times she just has to <UNK> her eyes and the air <UNK> drops a dozen degrees <UNK> the move to a more modern setting did not work against vanity fair and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting barbara kent <UNK> was under 5 feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall either this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman br br vanity fair is similar to <UNK> wife in that no matter how bad the main character is you have to love her and you know she deserves her <UNK> and then some but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it though based on the same story as <UNK> sharp this version had a different ending which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical for pleasure value the ending of <UNK> sharp is ultimately more enjoyable although <UNK> and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the ending of vanity fair is the better one whether or not you actually like it
<START> this is one of the better sci fi series it involves character development a few really moments and reasonable episode scripts as one other <UNK> said here it looked as if it were a mini series not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgets br br the problem with the show which in short is a godzilla series is that it started too big with incredible monsters fantastic science then it all boiled down to local americans doing stuff then the show ended too soon since the <UNK> were coming and hey a sci fi show is a sci fi show but half naked athletic people running around <UNK> is much more important so they only did 15 episodes instead of the expected 22 the audience was small too as people didn't really caught it on at 20 00 in the end the suits did it trust a marketing plan to destroy anything that looks remotely original and promising br br conclusion you have a show with good special effects stuff like huge monsters killing people or destroying <UNK> then going into genetic <UNK> <UNK> people human <UNK> end of the world also the only <UNK> are scenes with aggressive <UNK> or other annoying people being killed for their stupidity the down side is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge the show ends no real ending no closure just a bitter taste of cloth in one's mouth as if you just <UNK> a piece of suit
<START> hope <UNK> with sandra <UNK> is a real disappointment the story starts off ok her husband <UNK> on her and she finds out on national television so she has to <UNK> her life here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line but you become so bored with it she moves back with her parents and harry jr who plays justin begins hitting on her the two have no real chemistry at all yet your supposed to get the impression that justin is in love with her the movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it they had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss
<START> young michael <UNK> like young lord <UNK> was abandoned in the jungle on a pacific island as an <UNK> but instead of being raised by the apes he fell into the hands of a japanese soldier who was still living there because he hadn't heard the war was over and like young luke skywalker it turns out he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a ninja br br good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of <UNK> but those fighting skills didn't go away the <UNK> kid now named joe armstrong <UNK> in the army and gets himself <UNK> in the <UNK> meanwhile his <UNK> wan played by john gets rescued himself and goes to work as a <UNK> on the estate of <UNK> and terrorist go between don stewart using a cheesy accent that seems to <UNK> between french and spanish br br as these things happen everybody meets and <UNK> both <UNK> the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding <UNK> daughter from the bad guys in this <UNK> <UNK> production charles bronson was getting a bit long in the tooth now and <UNK> <UNK> needed a new star for their action flicks michael <UNK> filled the bill quite nicely and made quite a few films for them including several american ninja sequels br br this film is all action and <UNK> <UNK> bad guys at a record pace what he doesn't do steve james does doing his best rambo imitation and showing his considerable martial arts skills br br the film has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story but that's what the ticket buying public doesn't care about <UNK> certainly looks magnificent stripped to his fighting clothes no wonder so many sequels were made
<START> it was easy to get lost in the simplicity and light hearted humor of this year's best family film grand champion the story of a 12 year old boy buddy that with the help of his sister mom and best friend is determined to raise a grand champion steer it is a whimsical journey to the big competition after hokey <UNK> is <UNK> grand champion he is <UNK> for 000 to pay for the kids college education buddy finds out that the next time he sees hokey it would be on a <UNK> the kids <UNK> to steal the prize winning steer <UNK> to save him from the <UNK> this is where the fun begins julia roberts larry george <UNK> natalie steven bland tommy guy <UNK> and so many more stars create the backdrop for all the antics you wont believe who actually won the steer at the <UNK> he looks good in a mustache the soundtrack is rich with tunes from george <UNK> natalie willie nelson and more where else can you experience movie stars country western stars and <UNK> stars only in texas only in grand champion br br it is masterfully crafted simple little film that may be the best movie you see this year the movie opens in <UNK> cities on friday august <UNK> 2004 br br another great film from rope the moon and productions is in a <UNK> keep an eye out on the cable networks for this one
<START> the director <UNK> must be a very charming and <UNK> man for this dreadfully <UNK> project to have seen the light of day message so powerful and <UNK> in his previous two films is hopelessly <UNK> here <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> laughing heads etc <UNK> without purpose the parade of banal imagery is mostly generic stock from <UNK> images et al and the heavy handed digital <UNK> are amateurish in the worst way imaginable surely someone involved steven soderbergh executive producer could have pointed out that <UNK> a <UNK> to nearly every frame was a very bad idea the crude <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of images recalls a <UNK> <UNK> class and to make matters worse the computer animation sequences are more <UNK> than a 1980's wall street pie <UNK> this is not to say that improved <UNK> alone would have <UNK> this film but some <UNK> effort in this direction may have made it tolerable as visual fodder for the accompanying music i feel compelled to point out that the score by philip glass will certainly satisfy his fans not a radical departure but rather a <UNK> of what glass does best with lovely <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> ma if you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence while you may already be familiar with <UNK> once <UNK> but long abandoned <UNK> central <UNK> station <UNK> minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of 20th century <UNK> as the critical point when you should have headed for the exit sign hit the stop button etc you've been warned
<START> movies about u f o 's are always a nice way to kill some time so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick expecting what can be expected from a direct to dvd u f o mystery br br boy was i wrong at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u f o theme is just a <UNK> way of <UNK> unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda and this is not just a <UNK> movie from an average christian no this is christianity of the <UNK> <UNK> kind the scary kind br br in the end of this movie the non believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true <UNK> are going to heaven and non <UNK> are left behind br br when the joke is explained it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer <UNK> in case we christians are <UNK> now that's a <UNK> excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me br br this movie still tries to <UNK> non <UNK> using scare tactics believe in god or you will go to hell is the message here simple but quite offensive really especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different br br now let's assume you're a christian <UNK> yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie is this a good movie i'm afraid it isn't no actually i'm lying i'm glad it isn't the acting is horrible the pacing is horrible the plot is horrible especially the ending is laughably bad as soon as the movie starts you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected and you will be right br br in the first half hour it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u f o mystery but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look alike that starts <UNK> about the devil at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac but as it turns out he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie as soon as you start realizing this you know how this is going to end up but actually it ends up worse br br avoid
<START> nicolas cage and deborah <UNK> provide stunning performances in this 80's tour de force a great 80's movie akin to fast times at <UNK> high i highly recommend this movie to any child of the 80's who hasn't seen it it's a cult classic
<START> this film is so 1980's and that is what i like so much about it it does an excellent job of conveying the feel of that odd decade the reality that russian <UNK> could wipe you out at any time reagan in the white house telling everybody that things were great while more and more social programs were <UNK> young people dropped out but not as far as their parents of the 1960's did young people still went to school they just <UNK> so much <UNK> that their were all but dead nothing <UNK> them not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends how weird is it to realize that the murder was wrong but you are not sure why watching the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and telling of a very sick society glover is great keanu is great hopper is incredible one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen
<START> a stunning and thoughtful observation on modern life for youngsters in japan like of sand <UNK> into issues such as rape homosexuality and <UNK> angst in a subtle and significant way it gives an insight in to the youth culture struggling to define itself outside of the <UNK> of their <UNK> generation with it's strict <UNK> and <UNK> typical to japanese cinema often what isn't said is more important that what is so to those not <UNK> in japanese film and culture beware it can seem dull and <UNK> pretty much like every film to come out of japan bar if you don't know what to look for i saw it for the first time when i was 15 and was what originally <UNK> my interest in japan it's culture and language considering i'm now 22 and learning japanese with the intention of living there for 2 years needless to say it's a powerful film enjoy
<START> well i'm a huge fan and <UNK> of elizabeth <UNK> i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday we sat down to watch it and it was so boring i don't remember laughing once it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end elizabeth is great in this though maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth <UNK> fan though if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life it's a very <UNK> film
<START> i went into the closer she gets knowing that it was the story of the <UNK> mother fighting cancer i expected it to be a very harrowing depressing movie and although the subject matter is certainly emotionally wrenching the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends it shows a family's total dedication to meet the challenge of cancer together they refuse to lose faith in each other even in the darkest moments br br the most moving moments to me are when this faith is revealed little comments that the mother and the family make to each other that reveal her and their will to survive and their <UNK> emphasis on love and family <UNK> in this way it is an uplifting and profoundly hopeful film we should all be so lucky as to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness
<START> you can tell that this is the first offering by the director who also wrote it but you can also see the potential this guy has this is an obviously low budget film in the spirit of <UNK> saints of course <UNK> saints came out a few years after this so you could look at this as a diamond in need of some polish the acting was good if you're looking for deniro or michael madsen in a crime drama remember that these are young guys playing young guys trying to be criminals they're not going to be <UNK> like some of the veterans i would have love to have seen justin joe the main character go on to make more movies he was great in this good movie 3 stars out of 5
<START> the first thing i wanted to do after watching this film was watch it again because i'd missed lots with all the laughing i did i'm european and i've studied abroad and i've as good as lived with spanish french italian and german people the film was full of stereotypes which more often than not p people off and reading some of the other reviews i see that it did p people off but this film gets the stereotypes so right i cannot fault it except for maybe the way the french guy became a drunken party animal the english guy was the perfect <UNK> stereotype drunk annoying insulting but shines through in the end as well as the stereotypes the film also got the emotional aspect of studying abroad correct at first he's shy doesn't know anybody misses home doesn't know his way around as time progresses it becomes his home and when the time comes to leave it is extremely difficult a feeling people can only understand if they've experienced it i highly recommend this film
<START> the opening of the jungle promises us a <UNK> adventure with a science fiction element but mostly what we get is a <UNK> with lots of stock footage and padding and the odd <UNK> attack the movie is <UNK> when you want it to be gripping and tries to <UNK> interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals i had no idea that lions and wild <UNK> were natural enemies in the wild did you i thought the big cats stuck to hunting <UNK> but apparently the producers knew better br br as for the actors <UNK> does his usual great job of <UNK> the mustache and marie <UNK> is reasonably believable as the <UNK> thinking daughter nice <UNK> btw however rod cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition i'm sure he was in demand in his day but here he comes off as a rent a center bogart rough looking but with none of <UNK> range or timing he spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry <UNK> and any time the screenplay attempts to <UNK> up some romantic sparks between himself and <UNK> you just have to laugh that face isn't a good vehicle for <UNK> br br the screenplay is not entirely without merit although it does make some odd choices early in the first act the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey <UNK> but then basically ignore them until spoiler the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand <UNK> during the <UNK> scene and accidentally <UNK> near <UNK> this is so cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own end spoiler it's possible that the indian version of this movie which i understand ran better than 2 1 2 hours might have given the kid and the monkey more to do br br another thing that makes the film show its age spoiler is the issue of the <UNK> <UNK> the plot device that sets the <UNK> into motion in the first place when they finally appear the way the scene is filmed it's obvious that the <UNK> obviously elephants <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> aren't really attacking anyone or even moving all that fast and yet cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand <UNK> these days the idea of destroying the last known <UNK> of a species thought to be <UNK> would be <UNK> especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace end of spoiler br br so imo four stars which is pretty good for a robert production normally hack jobs rate two or three stars at best it's not a train wreck of a film or anything plus it seems to mean well with the daughter arguing for of the most <UNK> aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty <UNK> in <UNK> and there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle see it if someone offers to show it to you for free but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema
<START> one reasons why they call the 80's the awesome 80's is quality television shows like the wonder years war of the worlds the series v amazing stories and many more have always left an impression to each fortunate one of us that in time will always find a way to <UNK> itself to top that here comes monsters a series quite unique of its own and a theme fully <UNK> to monsters may it be the good the bad and the morbid br br if you're a fan of classic shows or if you have the fascination of horror films then this one is absolutely for you provided you can find this rare gem br br even the newer generations will be in awe with some of the episode with its <UNK> it's <UNK> use of gore effects or its story telling power and simplicity i guarantee because i'm 23 br br be sure not to miss this br br although it's a show seemingly forgotten by the modern world it will always be with those who can always remember
<START> this television show is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learn br br about animals watch the discovery channel if you want to watch br br <UNK> on television just watch mtv mtv stands for music television br br not <UNK> d <UNK> retarded skits or <UNK> kids crying br br their hearts out for not getting a <UNK> for there <UNK> birthday i bet br br that if you like this show i bet you love <UNK> la <UNK> and jackass huh i think my iq dropped ten points watching this show br br this is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planet br br some people think this is a good combination br br i on the other hand think it is br br and if you notice its a lot like jackass br br and <UNK> la <UNK> br br just a note this show is horrible
<START> i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff but this flick is just well bad br br i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established i think it mostly <UNK> down to script and direction though br br it was just bad br br i want to give this the lowest rating but i don't believe in that at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie so he gets four stars just above the average rating which this has so far
<START> in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable <UNK> for the genre personally i think he has been unfairly <UNK> throughout his career as an <UNK> of gore it's a pretty capable <UNK> and surprised me with its rich narrative that shows his <UNK> for small minded small town mentality and the of the police as well as the twisted ideals of the catholic church the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on the <UNK> lack of gore in the film shows a more <UNK> and psychological <UNK> to this film in its <UNK> mystery but the gore and <UNK> he does <UNK> is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a <UNK> accused murderer is <UNK> <UNK> by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and <UNK> <UNK> expertly choreographed to the modern tunes off a <UNK> radio br br another example was the final scene which was indeed awesome in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is <UNK> showed in a medium <UNK> which <UNK> its demonic appearance and evident <UNK> curiously considering his later works fulci also <UNK> the idea of <UNK> <UNK> upon the hamlet holding on to its <UNK> <UNK> and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up <UNK> from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman another thing i liked was that he adds to these character layers by making a <UNK> city girl into an ambiguous figure is she the <UNK> the priest fears for his <UNK> and perhaps more <UNK> for himself this giallo does lend itself to becoming one of <UNK> more personal and <UNK> films in that we actually get a fair <UNK> of ideas from him
<START> the <UNK> was the most underrated film of the decade despite my best efforts at home it is still seen as a bad movie i say to hell with everyone on this every one doesn't understand that it is in part a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end danny aiello plays a burnt out director with perfection and conveys a sad depressed man the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good the <UNK> of stones movie are absolutely funny this is harry stone and today i become a man in all a fine and sadly misunderstood movie plus a great cameo by little richard hilarious i hope that more people see this movie because people is not enough for a <UNK> br br silence
<START> this must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time the kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters a title like this makes a film flop even the french title is not much better too bad <UNK> <UNK> must have been enough to sell it br br this is a long film but largely worth it clearly influenced by hitchcock we have an <UNK> story about a personal ad bride her rich husband a <UNK> an identity switch and obsessive love the plot here is actually very good and takes us on an unexpected trip br br the thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship it is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people unfortunately this is what <UNK> the film down and makes it ultimately <UNK> we do like films to have a real sense of <UNK> and that is missing here br br it was the case in many of her films that <UNK> became a <UNK> for directors to play their fantasies out on and this time it doesn't work as well messy here is the fact that the director clearly just wanted to have <UNK> take her top off a few times <UNK> is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat br br basically the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began to make this film <UNK> and shorter and to snap but <UNK> didn't snap did he so it wanders a bit but remains interesting
<START> ok i know the original <UNK> aren't in this entry it even seems it doesn't belong in this series but it still a good movie it is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper <UNK> or <UNK> i give it a 9
<START> if you have few expectations then this will entertain for 90 minutes my problem is that they've <UNK> down this tale for the modern audience are already sexy exciting characters they don t need the <UNK> soundtrack and snappy dialogue
<START> it's a pity to throw away such a good idea the main idea of the movie is travel into past lives which fortunately is not a time travel but a journey inside man which has nothing to do with the past or the future maybe they shouldn't be called past lives at all in the film now that i think of it another minus i guess it's all in the present in a different space very interesting without causing much religious distress br br however the music is totally repetitive melodramatic sentimental and out of place not to mention western there should have been more variety and more thought on where there should be music and where there shouldn't the flashback romantic scenes take a lot of space and running time and are totally unnecessary the acting is not bad although the language has kept me from understanding better br br i believe the idea needed a little more thought developing and the inside scenes could have had better background settings because in many cases they seem unreal as a whole i would say that this movie leaves a lot to be desired
<START> twin peaks and blue <UNK> have always been two of my favourite pieces of film making and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times to be pretentious lynch can be like a good wine he must be <UNK> and over but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen for lynch never gives you the full answers br br many people will walk out of <UNK> drive possibly wanting to <UNK> themselves over the mind <UNK> visual jigsaw puzzle that has just <UNK> before them but there is a twisted logic to this film you just have to look for the clues betty <UNK> <UNK> arrives in hollywood <UNK> eyed and in search of stardom she then finds an <UNK> in her bathroom who has escaped from an attempted murder on <UNK> drive together they try to <UNK> the secrets behind the life this all leads to a club called where a blue box will reveal all and that is when the film throws everything out the window people we thought we knew are entirely different people altogether is it a dream a <UNK> about life's previous <UNK> you will either love this film or hate it david lynch always draws such extreme reactions from his viewers but as his universe itself is always about extremes it is fitting that his films <UNK> such reactions br br it is best to look at this film <UNK> rather than as a straight forward narrative and appreciate the fact that lynch is a film maker who will still let you draw your own conclusions he has had many <UNK> as of late particularly in vanilla sky where a mind <UNK> film decides to give you all the answers in the last rushed five minutes and you will probably forget about that film as soon as you walk out of the cinema <UNK> drive will haunt you
<START> 25 august 2003 league of extraordinary gentlemen br br sean connery is one of the all time <UNK> and i have been a fan of his since the 1950's i went to this movie because sean connery was the main actor i had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie the movie surprised me quite a bit the scenery and sights were spectacular but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery for me going to this movie was a waste of my time i will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection but i can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection
<START> mild spoilers br br and that's <UNK> ten of all time ' i stumbled across <UNK> by accident maybe that made it all the more special no <UNK> expectations on <UNK> one night and couldn't believe that i hadn't heard anything about it now that heath ledger is getting more famous in the usa i'm sure it's more available at the time i was telling friends about the film and no one could find it anywhere except the occasional <UNK> showing br br anyway in the black comedy gangster genre it fits in well with my other favorites and everybody in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve bryan brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes <UNK> with his small son and plays <UNK> with his henchmen also hilarious is the quick edit fate of a random car thief even heath was pretty good in it at the time i vaguely remembered him from a short lived series on fox called ' hopefully <UNK> jordan will make another hit but as far as i'm concerned this is his best yet
<START> i have just given a 10 for thieves highway i mention this for two reasons one to prove i'm not a <UNK> who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night br br we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all they'll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg <UNK> lots of <UNK> <UNK> each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we're talking about here has a great life she's healthy happy with only the occasional <UNK> to explain her <UNK> my feeling is this <UNK> type protagonist is a lot more <UNK> than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to <UNK> that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if i make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place by out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never <UNK> in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what a cop out really really lame br br secondly <UNK> <UNK> insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this that is without his plastic friend yep don't leave home without it especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve <UNK> cash in one way or another even when he first meets her it's the <UNK> <UNK> that does all the work <UNK> here <UNK> there <UNK> over there money money money where's the charm where's the charisma don't mention that attempt at the piano please br br girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a <UNK> as they probably don't either so it wont have <UNK> more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate <UNK> a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject br br i'll finish on a song br br pretty woman round the street pretty woman the kind i like to treat pretty woman i don't believe you you're not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy br br pretty woman wont you <UNK> me pretty woman i couldn't help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me br br pretty woman shop a while pretty woman talk a while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say you'll stay with me and i'll pay you i'll treat you right
<START> i wish i could have voted this movie a ten it's that funny if they had intended for it to be that funny i would have given it a ten i have to give it a 1 but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to watch see the giant <UNK> flash across the screen where did it come from what is it it flies it <UNK> it's <UNK> it's on strings this bird has real personality i was about ten when i saw it for the first time and when big bird appeared on <UNK> street i was sure they were one and the same
<START> death bed the bed that eats br br judging from the title you can guess what this movie is about and yet there is a lot more background story to this film then one might suspect br br okay so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food but there are also a few subplots i won't spoil them for you but they're a nice touch br br sadly the acting in this movie is very mediocre the fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole br br because there is a lot of voice over work the thoughts of characters are also revealed to the <UNK> sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't br br the effects are fine sure it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies but you really shouldn't just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously you have to admit that a killer bed is quite creative if you are easily <UNK> don't watch this movie you might never want to sleep again br br death bed the bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget but i'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies br br in conclusion i give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there
<START> i happened to catch this supposed horror flick late one friday night i wish i'd gone to bed tell me is a 3 <UNK> tall <UNK> clad <UNK> on a bike supposed to convey some sort of fear not here yet <UNK> low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor antonio <UNK> who is three times his size uh huh and the ending is so pitiful it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on what so ever i found myself asking is that it br br acting is about as good as it'll get in a low budget film the aforementioned <UNK> delivers a decent performance but it is my conclusion that jennifer maybe one of the worse actresses to ever <UNK> into <UNK> town sure cute face but bad acting br br rating 1
<START> there is only one racist joke in this <UNK> duck short which is basically when <UNK> rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to <UNK> black people yet br br aside from this point a <UNK> <UNK> is basically a fun interesting short where <UNK> meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way <UNK> is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time <UNK> is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood <UNK> terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode br br for people who are totally into <UNK> duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a <UNK> <UNK> br br available on youtube
<START> michael <UNK> has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen he has taken a play with a reputation for anti <UNK> and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews <UNK> said after the screening and i agree that <UNK> is his first tragic hero the first of his characters to be <UNK> by a driving <UNK> need for revenge he also points out quite rightly that a man who was anti <UNK> could not have written speech of if you <UNK> me do i not bleed <UNK> is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with <UNK> and honesty no character is free from flaws no character is evil <UNK> has placed the play in the <UNK> century which gives a lush background of <UNK> politics and <UNK> on which to project shakespeare's words br br if you get a chance to hear <UNK> speak about the film i highly recommend you take it since he gives details about life in <UNK> century <UNK> that <UNK> a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary br br jeremy <UNK> does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio a man who himself to bearing the burden of his past <UNK> <UNK> collins a relative unknown gives us an absolutely flawless stunning and detailed job as not only is ms collins beautiful she also gives layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play the rest of the cast also does a terrific job with a notable performance by kris marshall as and a beautifully subtle work by allan as playing the foil to <UNK> finally while al pacino pulls out his usual strong and loud performance his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words but you can see all the emotions and flowing into and out of him as he <UNK> his <UNK> changing br br if you like period movies i cannot recommend this movie enough
<START> there isn't much that comes close to the perfect paced storytelling and suspenseful action packed levels as <UNK> when it came out it was the greatest game of all time and even today it stays strong br br i will admit that this game did get boring after a few months of playing and by not playing it again until two years later i was thrust back into its greatest almost as if i was playing it for the first time again br br there are 20 action packed levels which is probably the most of any james bond game to date probably the most unforgettable one is the tank level which was likely the most explosive video game sequence at that time and the first person shooting as well as usage of q <UNK> is what james bond fans are always dying to use br br frankly as a james bond fan i look for aspects of a true james bond experience which are now showing up in the <UNK> games so this game while it has some great action and <UNK> <UNK> i was somewhat expecting a little more even back in 1997 i also disliked that this game didn't have q or m or <UNK> or anyone from <UNK> while watching the movies bond <UNK> with these characters at least a few times throughout each movie but they are nowhere to be seen in this game and vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively rather than the text dialogue they wound up using they had the technology they just didn't use it br br probably the most annoying feature of this game is that in some ways it follows the story of the movie precisely and other ways it's incoherent for example there are two many levels where you have to protect or save even though in the movie she can take care of herself there are also some unnecessary levels like the boat level where you have to <UNK> some bombs which is not in the movie which adds nothing to the storyline whatsoever there are even some levels where you rescue but at the beginning of the next level she's captured again how br br oh well even those little things can't really put this game down and while i do prefer the newer games this bond experience is definitely one you won't forget br br 8 out of 10
<START> this <UNK> film is episodic but nearly a constant series of chases mainly trying to escape police whether real or imagined as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal it is consistently inventive and entertaining its greatest value is in its <UNK> what hollywood looked like in the early <UNK> since 95 of it is shot outside among the streets and building <UNK> of the time one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here br br the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it with buster <UNK> sitting on the and thus moving from a long shot to a close up within seconds br br the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor one of the great keaton gags br br <UNK> print is sharp and clear almost <UNK> there is a <UNK> piano score <UNK> this is one to seek out and enjoy
<START> when i saw this movie i think i was a <UNK> in high school and i still feel like <UNK> master p for the hour 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back br br the guy who already posted is completely right master p is a wannabe mobster he like all the other <UNK> in this country made his millions off of selling rap <UNK> to young <UNK> white kids in this country it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it unfair as that might be <UNK> can't deal with this movie paints master p as a mobster named <UNK> the script is terrible with the acting to match completely unbelievable while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called the black sopranos br br please spare us that and stick to you are not a white mobster your not even a good actor master p please stick to your music for the sake of whoever <UNK> to it these days
<START> roy <UNK> is not steve mcqueen or clint eastwood but then who is the seven ups is one of the better cop movies even today and is second only to <UNK> <UNK> and the dirty harry series which isn't bad company there are three things that seem to make a good cop movie believable script with great acting great car chase scenes and some heavy action this movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in dirty harry <UNK> plays the head of a group of cops out to get bad guys sentenced to seven years or more hence the name seven ups overall not quite up to dirty harry or <UNK> but far better than all of the cop movies made since the dirty harry series 9 10
<START> having some <UNK> time before going to work i looked at my 50 movie pack comedy classics dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack <UNK> boom <UNK> starring a forgotten grace hayes classics is obviously the <UNK> word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public <UNK> anyway this movie also stars her son peter <UNK> and his wife mary <UNK> who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in <UNK> with benny <UNK> as a <UNK> shop <UNK> and <UNK> hall taking a break from the east side kids as <UNK> buddy the plot about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich <UNK> son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like <UNK> celebrity <UNK> and his dance with hall in drag and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves <UNK> however is all over the place with his confusion of the american <UNK> of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever though i did like his funny dance since this was only <UNK> minutes that i'm sure played on the lower half of the double feature bill i'll be <UNK> and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying
<START> a cheesy b crime thriller of the early the story is <UNK> the characters wooden allison hayes and lane are the only two that make it an eye <UNK> but one short shot only a few frames long shows an el train crossing the river on the state street bridge of the <UNK> series <UNK> built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme as they were delivered when new in 1950 for <UNK> fans like me that one short take makes the picture worthwhile i think films like this one <UNK> d o a with edmund o'brien the fugitive with harrison ford and others of the film noir genre big city crime dramas make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco <UNK> and recognize most of the street locations other wise it's a really <UNK> boring film
<START> like a circle around the human condition 2001 starts at the beginning <UNK> the middle and proceeds to the ending right back where we started noting the weakness of words compared to image s kubrick wisely <UNK> with dialogue <UNK> the power and essence of the scenery and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the <UNK> or not depending on the audience br br a <UNK> in cinematic history 2001 is a high water mark of direction execution and achievement if one considers the ambition of the film a film about everything and the measure of success the film achieved to that end a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made br br
<START> i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life and that is not saying a little because i consider myself to be somewhat of an <UNK> when it comes to crappy film but this is beyond bad this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it it's just bad br br reviewing this is almost impossible there are no strong points and nothing positive to say i'll just <UNK> about a few of the points that sucked first off the cgi has to be one of the worst i've seen i can't believe this movie was made in 2005 the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in <UNK> 5 way back when cgi was new and fresh it's poor beyond belief second the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime <UNK> and looking at their <UNK> i see that i'm correct <UNK> being able to breed enormous <UNK> is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie the pistol with <UNK> <UNK> seriously michael <UNK> fires 100 200 times without <UNK> in every other scene as if that was not enough there are also shape shifting planes at first they are regular f 16 fighters in the next scene they are something else completely and in the third scene they are f 16 again if you're buying stock footage please don't mix it like this br br honestly there is loads more to say but i think i'll stop you all understand what i'm saying honestly i didn't think this kind of movie was made any more it's like something ed wood would do completely ignorant of quality not caring how anything looks it's almost amazing in all it's awfulness if i could give it 0 10 i would but 1 10 is the lowest grade so that's it
<START> this brings back so many childhood memories i'm not old i'm 19 it's <UNK> the trains the old house the fallen runner the really scary <UNK> well it is when you're 6 the drama if the children can stop the train or will it crash this is a children's film without a doubt but it offers great harmless no blood guts guns etc for children and it's got bernard <UNK> in it who's cool 8 10
<START> this program was quite interesting the way the program was displayed made it all the more interesting string theory is also very interesting to listen too the whole three hours in my opinion were well worth it i enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the <UNK> extra <UNK> really <UNK> the mind if you have the chance watch this amazing documentary
<START> although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character this was classic h lots the characters outside of mike <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were true to form and the reunion scenes of <UNK> andre <UNK> and <UNK> kyle <UNK> were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen br br homicide the movie aka life <UNK> is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any 2 hour episode of the series <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life that's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike br br i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a <UNK> mood
<START> well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia <UNK> sometime in june of <UNK> and i really loved it my all time favorite madonna look was the 1990 blond ambition tour era this to me is madonna now that she is a mother of 3 she has to change some things to suit <UNK> and i totally agree this is a classic madonna concert i wish live to tell wasn't edited we saw <UNK> falling from buildings on <UNK> we can see a woman on a cross any way i'm looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show <UNK> and with a bunch of bonus footage she is a artist of all time the best out there and still at the top and going strong long live madonna
<START> this one was a surprise and better than most films i've seen recently highly enjoyable from start to finish this is a film that will surely satisfy 99 9 of movie fans worldwide great acting from everyone great script great story and fantastic plot and twists try not to miss it
<START> this is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of rob from british metal gods and how the band replaced him with <UNK> <UNK> who used to front a priest tribute band originally titled metal god this movie could have been something great instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down from the title change of metal god to the middle of the road <UNK> <UNK> to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly having spent most of my life in a professional metal band i was really looking forward to seeing this i was very let down by several points of the film the soundtrack is very not metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well the movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because 1 a movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack 2 there is nothing metal about <UNK> mark or jennifer aniston if bon <UNK> warrant <UNK> and poison are your idea of <UNK> go see this movie if iron maiden <UNK> priest <UNK> black <UNK> are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh
<START> i can just picture how this movie came to be br br so how else can we screw up our careers br br i know let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it br br perfect we'll get b grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10 of <UNK> original <UNK> we'll save millions and <UNK> in a massive profit never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place we as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story not the actors who made it so in the first place br br brilliant let's put a massive budget and get the <UNK> actors we can find br br and really that's what son of the mask can be described as just a simple b grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic br br nevertheless if the movie didn't contain the words the mask or anything to do with the mask it would be a nice kids movie for all it's massive flaws and horrible acting this really will appeal to kids it's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out like me but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it br br jamie kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie he clearly is trying to make the material work playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor the only thing that <UNK> out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this the character of <UNK> also deserves a mention as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film it's too bad the character is wasted on this film i would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask instead we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end br br the plot is so much by the books i won't bother to mention it here it's all so clearly obvious that even a disney <UNK> would be green with envy br br save your money this one is heading to dvd in three months from the looks of it shame on the studios for once again <UNK> a decent film with a horrible sequel didn't dumb and <UNK> teach them anything
<START> one of the worst movies i've ever seen absolutely awful poor acting poor story there isn't one redeeming quality about this movie to recommend <UNK> is much better avoid this movie like the plague
<START> a girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral soon the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly while i won't say that was an excellent film i will say that it was unlike anything i've seen before throughout my viewing i felt like i was watching a cartoon there are funny <UNK> between scenes and characters with <UNK> enhanced eyes later i found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense however just when you think you are watching something that could be a kid's movie you are <UNK> with nasty and gory visuals the story often <UNK> and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anti climactic at the time but in retrospect i appreciate it more for its originality my rating 7 10
<START> superb and charming justin henry is beautiful as a out and mischievous howard lead singer for the top ten hit making band the <UNK> the real magic is the titular sequence with an academy award worthy turn by <UNK> a performance that completely captures the mystical and yet down to earth <UNK> <UNK> not many films unbelievably so can find the essence of a special moment in a life and times i'd like to see this available at any home video <UNK> <UNK> without any <UNK> uh what's the deal br br thanks eddie a worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties a definite <UNK> in the <UNK> eye
<START> some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i don't feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost 2 won't go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the <UNK> to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i can't fill up ten lines <UNK> some great scenes br br spoilers br br the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop <UNK> on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an <UNK> on her the next woman fell on a bed of <UNK> the last one was stabbed in the eyes with <UNK> br br the other great one was where two surfers <UNK> are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying tongue a dude well you have to see it for yourself br br and of course the <UNK> children kicked ass br br end spoilers br br <UNK> stars
<START> after slightly over 50 years of avid film watching i've come up with some simple rules for making good movies br br 1 introduce your main characters early certainly within the first half hour 2 keep your characters to a minimum if adapting a novel combine characteristics and actions of minor characters br br into one person 3 make sure your characters actions have credibility if necessary create additional scenes to establish motivation 4 keep the action clear violence does not have to be explicit but it must not be confusing either 5 get the best music money can buy frequently it matters more than acting photography etc 6 usually if a movie isn't very good within the first 10 minutes it's not going to get any better br br cannon for is a <UNK> example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed elmer <UNK> score is one of the worst i've ever heard in a <UNK> budgeted movie this is altogether surprising considering <UNK> <UNK> man with the golden arm ' the magnificent seven ' the great escape ' sons of katie <UNK> paul direction is lackluster and confusing performances <UNK> from very good don gordon peter duel to terrible <UNK> giovanna <UNK> <UNK> with the usually reliable george <UNK> falling somewhere in the middle this should not be surprising considering the mediocre direction and amateurish script which breaks rules 1 2 and 3 br br don't waste your time i give cannon for a <UNK>
<START> to think this film was made the year i was born to think people are still having their <UNK> rights taken away now in the name of <UNK> security to think this movie was intentionally banned from the american public punishment park <UNK> the political <UNK> in the united states better than any movie i've ever seen had it been more widely seen would it have changed anything a movie like this is so <UNK> it has the potential to cause <UNK> it shakes you up and forces you to take sides it makes you face the issue are you for the people's right of <UNK> in a time of war or for the <UNK> being <UNK> in the name of national security the protagonists are forced by the government to race to the american flag in a game that <UNK> the very ideals the flag stands for the acting is totally convincing so much so i can't see any acting going on here at all if this is a scripted documentary it's more convincing than any reality show on television today punishment park is possibly the most important film ever made it really makes you think
<START> let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place i had to watch it one day and i figured that i guess i can <UNK> up and enjoy it for what it is and it might turn out to be entertaining what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen bar none first of all there was nothing humorous in the least bit the creators expected humor to be laughable passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of mouth and use scene after scene of bland played out aspects to charm the audiences light hearted side while still making them <UNK> and ah for more with boring action scenes and insipid lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it the acting was dull the humor was tedious and the characters plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it which even though that's what age range it was aimed at that does not excuse it for being so poorly <UNK> and causing me to feel so parents spend your money on up wall e the chronicles the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best recent family kids flicks or even alvin and the <UNK> is better than this filth
<START> wow even american idol and so you think you can dance have more adult stuff now than wwe at least the <UNK> has a number of people <UNK> the judges and here is wwe plodding with one of the worst moves in tv history by changing itself into pg now when i switch sometimes to see what's going on this is what i get br br 1 the ugly midget sharing his space with the main for apparently no reason except for thrilling the young fans and of course beating <UNK> <UNK> a capable wrestler in every match br br 2 a guest host every week to spoil the of fun which was otherwise present all these host are cheap b grade <UNK> trying to <UNK> to fame again by cracking horrendous 5 year old jokes and making silly references br br 3 time and a female wrestler forgot her name most probably eve giving lessons on various street words <UNK> which are neither street nor cool they were fun before stealing stuff and being loud mouths br br 4 the <UNK> are clad in unwatchable outfits <UNK> their best to look sexy smart and powerful by the way i hate this <UNK> remember when <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were there those were the times plus these <UNK> are bad <UNK> which adds to the misery i have seen some old matches of wwe in vintage collection and the <UNK> over there were professional not amateur br br 5 pg move <UNK> so many things almost no blood during matches <UNK> being terribly irritating john cena doing even more of his <UNK> act crowd containing many children who are so annoying almost no heels etc br br 6 and yeah why keep so often one in every month have they lost it no actual <UNK> or rivalry is ever created and the ones that are done look fake and just till the <UNK> gets over ones br br 7 vintage michael cole and a few of his quotes br br ladies and gentlemen you are watching the longest running television show in history every week br br the brutal and vicious assault by he doesn't use it for anyone else randy <UNK> legacy br br a vicious attack on stephanie triple <UNK> husband br br wwe is now almost towards its demise hope vince gets up from his <UNK> and does something bring back the tv 14 or attitude era 2 out of 10 for the current state of wwe
<START> i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth she played well in this movie but the plot sucked the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a <UNK> when one of jerry <UNK> <UNK> friends gets married the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married <UNK> the money 10 000 from all his friends anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since i'm glad i only paid 50 for this movie it really wasn't good at all i rated it out of 10 stars
<START> curse of the forty doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review so i'll just make some random observations about it br br cool opening credits br br no plot br br is there anyone who's ever seen a horror film before and can't guess within the first 20 minutes who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes br br hey that newcomer alexandra ford is pretty hot br br richard lynch made up to look about 100 years old and john phillip law have fun tongue in cheek cameos br br karen black has a bigger role but she's not fun she's rather embarrassing br br martin <UNK> is on screen for about 40 seconds but still got his name on the video cover did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around br br i hate cheap computer generated effects in horror films br br 1 2 out of 4
<START> i got a chance to talk with the co creator rebecca at the 2002 high falls film festival in rochester ny she said that her style is to be completely open and <UNK> in filmmaking but was very happy to be so severely <UNK> in the tight quarters of the group home the narrow <UNK> and small rooms were expertly shot with a realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work br br sister helen herself is a remarkable character coming from tragedy in her own life to being an unusual combination of caring tough and street smart the way the film introduces us to her past is excellent spending only a few carefully selected minutes <UNK> throughout br br in all i can't begin to correctly heap on praise for this film it really is a treasure of cinema and the subject a treasure of humanity
<START> this film's premise seems to be that the passing of the world war 2 generation in america with its apple pie <UNK> and <UNK> morality was a terrible tragedy those awful hippies ruined everything apparently br br what holds the film together are the excellent performances particularly <UNK> which is truly remarkable otherwise we have a boring slice of life drama just over 24 hours of jack's life with <UNK> br br i found it a chore to sit through
<START> the plot is somewhat original and all the actors did their job pretty well there is a plenty of comic relief too some things do not make a lot of sense e g the first chase scene why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave the russians actually speak russian without accent but the cars are extremely strange with models <UNK> like 50 years and so the place seems <UNK> out of time overall if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well
<START> here on earth is a surprising beautiful romantic tale about samantha who has both boy problems and health problems as her love for her current boyfriend <UNK> fades away her love for <UNK> <UNK> like a new spring flower br br i found this movie very touching very warm very romantic and touching i enjoyed every bit of this movie and that's pretty rare i highly do recommend this movie to all movie lovers this is one film you don't want to miss d br br by the way if you're a very sentimental person who easily cries while watching movies bring <UNK> on the other hand it was a really really good movie very romantic and surprisingly good d br br
<START> worst film ever nothing more needs to be said aaron carter is utterly <UNK> and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end i wish i could be more <UNK> in describing the movies many oh so many flaws however i cant be bothered get too angry to form proper sentences br br in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in so bad its good kinda way br br it was <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> whoever <UNK> this one to <UNK> of the lost <UNK> certainly knew he spoke he might as well have <UNK> it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed kay reminds one more than a little of both <UNK> <UNK> the shadow and clark savage doc savage the shadow quintessential man of mystery and the very first dark knight was also thought to be one kent if one were to take <UNK> first name first and add to it the kent you end up with <UNK> clark kent funny <UNK> like indiana jones isn't above <UNK> the <UNK> of an ancient civilization though his <UNK> are often more blatant and less <UNK> <UNK> than <UNK> unfortunately this two <UNK> is a far cry from subsequent serials from any era in terms of overall quality one of the first <UNK> that something is <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> the cinematic storytelling is a scene where <UNK> on <UNK> quite literally breathing down his neck simply watch as escapes their <UNK> in a hot air balloon why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie making mysteries that plague these two films br br the second half of this two <UNK> is even worse than the first granted this was one of the first ever serials and as such should be cut a bit of slack but there are limits even to tolerance at one point the capture of the hero is <UNK> not on screen but in the narration itself talk about cutting <UNK> fritz lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did the <UNK> is a bitter <UNK> indeed to swallow
<START> but had to see just how bad it could get the <UNK> was thin to begin with but it just kept getting worse a female genetic <UNK> <UNK> student uses her research on <UNK> to <UNK> create a male because a <UNK> weapon used in <UNK> killed off <UNK> of the worldwide male population the surviving men are either high <UNK> <UNK> in back alley <UNK> or crazed <UNK> in run down football <UNK> plotting to <UNK> the <UNK> the entire process <UNK> the <UNK> of a large bowl of <UNK> press a few buttons and <UNK> you get a baby not only that but he will age to mid <UNK> in a month and then begin to age normally how convenient eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to <UNK> the <UNK> br br this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved as adam quickly learns what men did survive are treated as <UNK> criminals because they are dangerous <UNK> that cannot help there genetic <UNK> to violence the propaganda machines have been in full swing <UNK> women into believing all men are <UNK> and murderers this has led to <UNK> being the norm the fall of christianity female only <UNK> via <UNK> and oh yeah world peace among other implied results all of which seem unlikely given that only 30 years had <UNK> since the war adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next all the while being <UNK> <UNK> to be non violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf with the fbi on his trail looking for fresh meat and his creator trying to <UNK> him for herself it seems he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all br br all in all i would not recommend this movie br br i did however enjoy <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of the <UNK> to hate <UNK> director of the fbi and julie <UNK> didn't do bad as hope the <UNK> either
<START> let me <UNK> this by going on record i am a huge george clooney fan and i love john in 'the <UNK> well i was and i did br br this was the world's worst hang nail and it took minutes to rip it off the <UNK> boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and <UNK> when it would be over br br every funny scene was in the previews all three of them there was no real story no character development and the script was just plain bad i've had a that was more enjoyable br br the title should have been bad this movie is a lock for a <UNK> it should get a whole <UNK> of <UNK> i want my money back
<START> based on actual events of <UNK> silent film the <UNK> <UNK> concerns an <UNK> russian ship on which <UNK> conditions lead to a <UNK> shocked by conditions on the ship citizens of the <UNK> city <UNK> <UNK> to the support and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of <UNK> forces who attack the <UNK> supporters with savage force br br <UNK> is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily <UNK> and edited sequences amazingly each of these sequences manage to top the previous one and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> to the massacre on the <UNK> steps the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history filming largely where the real events actually occurred director <UNK> vision is extraordinary as he builds not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence some of the most memorable images ever committed to film br br to describe <UNK> as a great film is something of an understatement it is an absolute essential an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form purely visual cinema at its most brilliant often <UNK> seldom <UNK> never <UNK> br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> this superb 40's post war classic tends to be overlooked these br br days when it was released in 1945 it <UNK> up at the 1946 br br oscars mostly at the expense of it's a wonderful life ' both films were up for best film best br br director and best actor all won by <UNK> <UNK> march br br and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell a br br real life soldier who lost both hands in an explosion play the br br returning soldiers finding life is very different from what they br br remember myrna loy is superb as <UNK> wife who has to keep br br the family together while he has been away the tear <UNK> br br scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent all three br br men find that they have problems <UNK> to post war life not br br least russell coming to terms with artificial hands and his <UNK> br br cathy <UNK> trying to be too helpful sam is <UNK> that he doesn't care if the film makes no br br money at all as long as everyone in america sees the film so they br br will appreciate what these men went through if any film is worth 10 out of 10 it is this one
<START> this cheap and rubbish film is about a <UNK> test rocket that is sent into space with a <UNK> of animals it <UNK> for a while then unexpectedly returns crash landing in a forest <UNK> a vicious mutant creature br br like many films of this type night fright features dumb teenagers on down to 60's surf music before being killed none of the murders however are even remotely memorable as we don't really see anything one thing we do see however is that one of the teenagers appears to be about 40 years old and sports a quite <UNK> silly <UNK> br br for a creature feature to work it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly in this film however we only get the <UNK> glimpses of the monster it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster but i'm not sure as the photography was so dark i simply couldn't make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time although my gut feeling was that i probably wasn't missing very much
<START> don't get fooled by the and the comment below this is just 1 poor movie the way george <UNK> played his character the soft gangster makes it very annoying to watch the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this de in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else his emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film the things he says as a voice over doesn't add anything to the film it just makes <UNK> an even more <UNK> character with is head in the clouds br br the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors let's hope jon will use his own style and ideas for his future films
<START> the whole movie seemed to suffer from poor editing every scene seemed to take forever to unfold and when they did i felt like i had waited a long time for very little to happen i guess i missed the whole point of the movie either that or there wasn't one
<START> this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives my heart is <UNK> every time i saw the scene of hanging i have no words any you must see this brilliant picture
<START> i first saw this movie at a video store and being the <UNK> fan i am had to rent it to see what it was all about since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious some of the parts are pointless and random but that's what makes them so amusing you'll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and <UNK> on the head with a <UNK> are funny in order to appreciate this movie i was really impressed br br i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job nothing oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern <UNK> and situations used i wouldn't suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa br br all in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to
<START> br br never ever take a film just for its good looking title br br although it all starts well the film suffers the same <UNK> you see in b films its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious br br a film to be listed on top of the garbage list br br
<START> no is a very high rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web so i really wanted to know why and i was anything but disappointed br br if you can get past the very bizarre but rather funny first episode you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world a very well drawn perfectly animated world that is br br i can't tell much of the story without spoiling it so i'll just say that it's a high school comedy and yet it's not i can't really say what it's about really br br seriously i'm a huge anime fan and i've got around 50 full series and i'm not kidding when i say that even though i haven't finished watching it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection i fell in love at first sight with this one and i assure you that at the very least you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm trust me i don't go around giving a 10 to every thing that i watch
<START> i saw the movie while i was in a class a few years back in high school i thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind <UNK> i think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things or those who get frustrated when they can't solve <UNK> its a good movie based on a true story that happened in my home town of toronto <UNK> so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the <UNK> there watch this movie and for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws realize that in real life this same stuff does happen but thats all i want to say on that the <UNK> are good some are hard some are not but the movie also leaves you wanting more more <UNK> more explanation just <UNK> more something more i want to add is that the ideas within this movie the underground <UNK> world does exist but there is a lot more to it to find it you can not look for it to never look for it would be no way to find it leave your mark and it will find you
<START> just re saw this last night and to put it <UNK> style instead of substance we can already guess that there had to be a lot more to jerry lee lewis than what is depicted here the jerry lee lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time but then again all the other characters are only one <UNK> stroke from being total cartoon characters br br let's take the beginning we see jerry lee and his cousin jimmy <UNK> over to the black jazz club and we see jerry getting his inspiration might be possible we see how the two cousins choose different paths in life also possible then we cut to jerry lee playing the piano as an adult now played by dennis quaid and it's thrilling and a little scary cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin myra from then on the whole thing turns into a <UNK> of certain events played out in a style <UNK> a news reel on high speed br br not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made jerry lee alec baldwin as jimmy is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this an <UNK> of his greater <UNK> in the years to come <UNK> <UNK> as myra is the most one character in the film she <UNK> she <UNK> she <UNK> <UNK> and play <UNK> and that's about it there is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third mrs lewis and speaking of wives where are the first two that is why this really can't be classified as a biopic but more of a inaccurate news reel we see jerry get his first song played on the radio we see his second single going into the top ten we see his third go to no 1 and so on then comes the inevitable downfall absolutely no basis in reality br br to conclude another minor <UNK> the movie takes place from <UNK> to and still myra says i am only 13 right up till the end
<START> for those of you unfamiliar with <UNK> he is of course the definitive scrooge of all them christmas carol movies me i guess i'm really bad i haven't actually seen the darn thing i guess those who have seen christmas carol and so used to his character might find the <UNK> of st <UNK> rather surprising you see in this movie <UNK> has two roles one he plays a heavy better and in the other he's in drag as a <UNK> for a private girl's school so once you get that through your thick skull this movie offers plenty of <UNK> the plot is deals with the way the school tries to make some desperately needed money through a horse race it's actually a little more complicated for the small kids to handle but i think they would be <UNK> with their antics and with the horses to really notice the adults too might get <UNK> over all the thick accents being thrown around as well but again the story is reasonably light the action crazy and frenetic for one to really notice ps the kids all look like they come from the <UNK> school of <UNK>
<START> as an avid reader of clive barker i truly anticipated this film prior to it's release i was not let down is a horse of a different color rich in the underlying <UNK> of western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we have never seen before barker is at his best when he allows us to <UNK> into his world of <UNK> horror yet showing us the other side of the <UNK> here the monsters are the <UNK> beautiful beings while the humans are the <UNK> ugly creatures of self <UNK> we soon learn that we were wrong all along by far my favorite performance by the often under used craig <UNK> and the added bonus of david <UNK> as <UNK> is a cast best seen then believed the monsters are portrayed <UNK> by a <UNK> of english creature masters whom many also brought the to life in <UNK> including <UNK> himself doug <UNK> is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre and anyone who needs just a little something more out of their horror story this is clive barker at his finest
<START> i'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people the series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good br br people tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end this is not good to do you should look at the total not the end result it is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but damn we had a lot of nice new characters br br please do not <UNK> yourself to a few characters but <UNK> yourself to the series the plot please do understand that i didn't like it when <UNK> died when died but well it needs to be done can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time come on face it if they didn't die they would be <UNK> in this way you will always keep the tension will he survive will he die i do realize that people <UNK> their <UNK> to characters i do that too my favorite character was the one who could get into every computer he wanted he was the one who was mysterious he could do things with the computer no one else could do br br i wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating should we look at the final season instead of the total should we not see how good the series was when it started should we not see how much we enjoyed it
<START> this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something they can be better than the pros the main character doug showed off his skills in flying a <UNK> aircraft which somehow <UNK> to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with maybe make a good investment <UNK> buy a few things but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle not once not twice not even three times yes four times the thing to look most forward to are the <UNK> <UNK> in this movie just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence there's another cheesy end sequence then another definitely a movie one must watch to believe and maybe own just to remind <UNK> of how awesome the 80s must have been
<START> despite some really <UNK> locations in the <UNK> and some <UNK> energetic music by franco this film doesn't quite reach the level of joe <UNK> similar efforts while staying just about as trashy the author of the original book <UNK> the <UNK> of a woman <UNK> directed and had a role in this film which mostly <UNK> showcases a very young annie belle as she gets in a variety of oddball sexual situations her boyfriend played by <UNK> al <UNK> actually <UNK> of her sleeping around and even <UNK> her to continue her practices even after the two of them are married maria drops by as a professor who is oh so usually married simultaneously to two women one of whom is played by herself despite beginning <UNK> and having a few hilarious lines of dialog like can you see me with the naked eye i can see you better naked the film <UNK> along up until the less than spectacular finale much like <UNK> <UNK> and the last cannibals the main characters are all in search of some lost tribe but don't get your hopes up there's no violence at all in this film and not much sex either for that matter just a lot of nudity and silly dialog i couldn't help but find some appreciation for this little film if only for the completely <UNK> logic the film goes by
<START> two years after this movie was made the <UNK> came out don't waste your time on this one see the <UNK> instead the <UNK> is essentially the same story as trial by jury with better acting better directing and a far more gripping aura about it william hurt was not believable as a cop gone bad and <UNK> <UNK> couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit you didn't become involved enough with character to be that upset by what was happening to her also the way in which she <UNK> with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way kathleen role as a hooker killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot
<START> i wanted to love this movie everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable if not groundbreaking film it was set in southern france good looking and recognizable actors led the cast and i really admired the vibrant african costumes the <UNK> and music despite all this i didn't love it movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing but secret laughter doesn't do that and matthew as played by long and <UNK> both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better <UNK> as much warmth and passion as <UNK> fish i used <UNK> deliberately because it was one of a few too few strong lines and moments <UNK> throughout the film another winner was when catches matthew <UNK> around her apartment he finds a book of hers with her first name written on it and says your name is i never knew then he insists that she call him by his christian name i watched this scene <UNK> as matthew asked over and over to say my name realizing that up until that moment they always called each other by their last names i thought this was a turning point for the film and expected that it get better it didn't why do and matthew always seem to stand at ten <UNK> even in that say my name scene what does matthew like about aside from her obvious beauty and why would a sensible woman like fall for a comic book writer who regards his marriage as something he can put on hold when a beautiful exotic comes along and i'd like to add that it was a little hard for me to get behind a romance built on adultery yes jenny is a vicious <UNK> but if i were in her shoes but i'd probably match her cruella tactics to stop my husband from <UNK> believe it the story hints at painful past but never fully explores it some critics say <UNK> seemed a little awkward here and i agree for goodness sake the actor <UNK> more <UNK> longing and passion as that early 19th century <UNK> mr <UNK> and while wearing those hideous <UNK> as for long who did shine in <UNK> jones' there were times when she seemed to concentrate more on her accent than playing her character even so there were many moments  the <UNK> my <UNK> scene among them  when she was in total control and came across really well yet <UNK> is not without its redeeming qualities and i've found that it grew on me with more viewings <UNK> was well portrayed as supportive and well meaning even if she doesn't fully understand attraction to matthew i absolutely loved it when <UNK> faced off with mama in those <UNK> <UNK> scenes my husband liked it and usually he's the first to sigh and throw insults at the screen if he doesn't like what is going on he even <UNK> at the scene when sammy asked matthew some very frank questions about sex so there you have it <UNK> was good enough to entertain an <UNK> <UNK> like my <UNK> but an avid <UNK> like myself will need more than one viewing to appreciate what the director and writer were trying to convey
<START> i generally like <UNK> work but this movie was completely retarded but sadly not retarded enough to make it <UNK> retarded i just sat mouth <UNK> wondering when it would end the plot makes only a <UNK> of sense i think it was intended to be campy i mean haunted hair <UNK> how could it not be but the humor such as it was fell flat not funny not scary not gory i would say perhaps was a hired hand on this project but he appears to have written this boring trash as well i still need to fill a couple more lines what else is there to say i suppose i could finish by saying better luck next time san
<START> my reaction to this remake of the italian job is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when i saw it this is the first movie i saw after i had just landed a job after 8 months of <UNK> and going back to school for money was still tight but i no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills or eating lunch and the sense of relief and <UNK> i was feeling at the time was enormous in consequence my enjoyment of italian job was probably far out of <UNK> to its actual worth br br still i picked it up used on dvd a few weeks ago and watched it again and i still enjoyed it immensely i have never seen the original though i have heard it is an absolute classic but its modern day counterpart is <UNK> watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes br br what initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack imo don davis writes some of the most <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> pleasing <UNK> around <UNK> opens with a sly witty <UNK> <UNK> that combines strings guitar brush work and quiet moments it won me over completely from the opening seconds and the whole movie is like this i haven't heard this kind of <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack music since stewart <UNK> left the police and started doing <UNK> for movies like <UNK> fish there are at least a dozen <UNK> scored <UNK> in here along with some pop song remakes that range from all right to inspired for people to whom the soundtrack is important this movie is a delight br br on to the movie i can take or leave mark <UNK> but he's okay here as the leading man and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well he's the weakest major actor in the film but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong especially donald sutherland in a bit part <UNK> <UNK> jason ed norton seth green and <UNK> <UNK> all turn in solid fat free performances norton seems to mostly be <UNK> it in <UNK> has it that he didn't really want to be in the film but he's still a natural even at 1 2 power my one <UNK> with the casting and acting is with the character <UNK> who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor his part seems to be <UNK> into the movie and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the late walk on nature of the character if i were a cynical sort i would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a role <UNK> never happen br br production values camera work stunts plot everything <UNK> along quite nicely and gray and his production crew pull things together pretty <UNK> with the exception of the <UNK> character see above br br the dialog has a nice light touch that <UNK> your <UNK> and there are several satisfying major and minor plot <UNK> along the way my favorite moment when <UNK> character tells <UNK> character that he's just lost the element of surprise <UNK> proceeds to cold <UNK> norton with a right cross and then asks him were you surprised hmmm maybe you had to be there br br of course the movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief to work but if you just relax and go along with it and don't think too hard about the <UNK> of cracking a safe underwater or the <UNK> of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate la traffic via a <UNK> etc you'll have a fun ride br br the italian job it's lightweight summer fluff but it's very good for what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else it isn't good enough for an 8 but i'd give it a 7 5
<START> this movie <UNK> a certain brand of comedy horror of a strictly adult kind but quite different to the troma movies with which it shares certain qualities the humour is rough and ready but fast and furious if the idea of hideous dolls with evil powers and twisted minds don't make you <UNK> with boredom reach for the six pack of beer and enjoy the best <UNK> film yet
<START> i've never been compelled to write a review about anything but seeing such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something first people just have to get over the fact that the voices are different once you watch an episode it never really comes to mind ever again the humor is original and while yes some jokes do carry over from the movie they are delivered fresh some of it is even reminiscent of shrek self <UNK> humor a lot of these jokes seem aimed at teens or original fans of the movie as much as <UNK> and younger patrick <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are both hilarious as they <UNK> their roles as and and their annie award nominations were well <UNK> br br this show takes some time to love to really get in the groove of things so to speak if you ignore the horrible theme song which really shouldn't warrant that much in the way of how you judge a show since it's only 30 seconds of the overall product this show is laugh out loud hilarity and doesn't lose any of the <UNK> new groove spirit
<START> like the first one the team of jackass are back to try to kill themselves with whatever manner they see fit either it's fitting yourself in a <UNK> <UNK> and rolling down a <UNK> or getting yourself deliberately <UNK> by a bull or something even worse br br the first one was crazy and that's how you can describe it it was also really hard laughing film but this one is completely nuts it's got even more dangerous stunts and even harder laughs so i think watching dumb idiots getting themselves killed is gonna be the funniest thing this week br br so before <UNK> comes out i shall laugh my a out
<START> but of course i was wrong br br now i never expected to like the first movie i'm not sure what's up with disney's marketing group but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish or silly or stupid and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but and no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than the <UNK> new groove which is why i was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when i finally broke down and saw it i entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained br br despite disney's track record with direct to video sequels i had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with here but in the end i was nothing but disappointed and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way there's almost no humor targeted towards adults the original songs are uninspired and <UNK> cute the animation while not bad still doesn't come close to emperor which was no lion king to start with br br the main plot as such is <UNK> minor and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini plot flashbacks in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single <UNK> br br david spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there isn't exactly a lot of john goodman either so overall we're just left with far too much of patrick <UNK> who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead here br br although kids might find it somewhat fun the only thing new groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original
<START> i do not remember at least in the last ten years or so a movie that i have liked less than mama <UNK> from the non existent acting to the atrocious singing i was cringing at least once per minute i don't believe i could even recall one brief segment that i <UNK> i do know that i will never watch this disaster again i cannot believe that with such high expectations due to the talent colin <UNK> meryl streep pierce brosnan that a movie could be such a flop but to see the lack of acting skills shown the seemingly drug induced dancing and then horrors of horrors to hear the singing of pierce brosnan i cannot see how this movie will not make it into the hall of shame definitely a movie that never should have been made and just in case you missed it the first time one that i will never watch again
<START> my main criticism is quite simply that it isn't long enough or detailed enough i would have loved to see more of everything the building of the <UNK> the <UNK> the training the first lift to <UNK> <UNK> for departure <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> everything i would have liked to see more of the first leg <UNK> to earth instead of <UNK> there like a corporation bus in fact i would have liked to see a series on the scale of earth story made of this with a full hour dedicated to every planet and maybe another to the loop around the sun as it was i was left hungry on the other hand i do understand budgets and <UNK> attention <UNK> br br re the science let's be fair about the speed of light time <UNK> they did mention at the beginning that there was a <UNK> in conversations but they let this <UNK> once they reached the outer planets some kind of conversation had to be presented to the viewers and we have to assume that the <UNK> was edited out for the sake of so no complaints there but zero for <UNK> <UNK> the only film in which <UNK> make no noise was kubrick's 2001 and even then he <UNK> out by using the noise of the crew breathing in their <UNK> which was pretty effective i wish the makers of space odyssey had realized just how eerie the sight of vast rocket <UNK> <UNK> in absolute silence might be but alas <UNK> lets out much the same <UNK> as every other cardboard spaceship in every other cardboard scifi film br br but the rest of the science was excellent no complaints there in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did i just hope that having done this film won't <UNK> the bbc from making a really detailed version but i suppose that's not for next week or next year either
<START> edge vs michaels boring in general loved the sweet <UNK> music into the chair 4 10 taker vs one of the worst matches i've seen predictable as hell 1 10 tripe threat wwe match why do i watch them nobody ever wins a championship at the <UNK> its not the main event liked it when show drove <UNK> through the wall 3 10 world <UNK> championship pretty ok match kind of more a beat down by tripe h than a match but i was happy to see it after watching crap 5 10 royal <UNK> good <UNK> liked the brand showdown the <UNK> thing and the end 7 10 overall still crap why does anyone watch the <UNK>
<START> minor spoilers br br first i must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with such basic messages in it nuclear war will inevitably destroy all of civilization and women are for making babies it is absolutely incredible how well <UNK> the plot is to hit in these two points as with a golden hammer essentially everything about this movie annoyed me the casual <UNK> the character whose sole <UNK> was coming from texas the mysterious choice of dying mars orange and of course the flawed science of it all then the martian woman screaming as if she had just noticed that she was blind what was that however i will give it credit the fifties did spit out some <UNK> things but not much
<START> recent years have seen a number of <UNK> of famous singers and ray the story of ray charles has much in common with walk the line which was made the following year and told the story of johnny cash cash and charles were near exact <UNK> both being born in the early thirties and dying in 2003 <UNK> both grew up in poverty in the american deep south both lost a brother in an accident during childhood both achieved success in the 1950s both experienced problems in their <UNK> and both were addicted to drugs all these matters are <UNK> in both films there are also similarities with ron <UNK> a beautiful mind although that film was about a <UNK> rather than a musician it like both ray and walk the line <UNK> the part played by its <UNK> wife in helping her husband to overcome his problems br br ray charles was born to a single mother in a poor black community in georgia in 1930 his original name was raymond charles robinson but when he was starting his career as a musician he dropped his <UNK> to avoid confusion with the boxer sugar ray robinson in some ways charles had an even harder time than did cash having to cope with two additional <UNK> in the shape of his <UNK> and of the racism which affected all black americans especially in the south during his lifetime charles had a particularly traumatic childhood witnessing the death of his younger brother george in a drowning accident and going blind about a year or two later he appears to have been haunted by nightmares and feelings of guilt over <UNK> death throughout his life br br the first half of the film is rather slow moving and is a standard <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> biopic telling the story of how the young charles is taught to play the piano becomes a nightclub performer and then rises to fame as a major artist falling in love along the way with the beautiful della <UNK> the best scenes in this part of the film are the flashbacks to <UNK> childhood there is an effective <UNK> image of <UNK> glass <UNK> hanging from a tree in front of his house perhaps this was one of his few visual memories of his life before he went blind there is also a memorable scene in which the <UNK> charles <UNK> a <UNK> bus driver into letting him on the bus by pretending to have lost his sight on <UNK> beach in reality he would only have been thirteen at the time of the <UNK> <UNK> br br the second half of the film becomes more interesting as it moves into more controversial territory focusing on <UNK> drug addiction the problems in his marriage caused by his affair with <UNK> one of his backing singers and his battles against racism in the early sixties charles caused a sensation by <UNK> to play in front of a <UNK> <UNK> audience in georgia although contrary to what is stated in the film this did not result in his being banned from performing in the state he also fought against racial <UNK> within the music industry itself performing not only <UNK> black styles of music such as <UNK> and rhythm and blues but also <UNK> white ones such as country and western regarded by many black americans as the music of choice of the redneck community br br as peter <UNK> film critic of the guardian noted ray is a sunny film which turns away from the darker side of things it <UNK> any mention of such matters as the death of <UNK> beloved mother <UNK> during his teenage years his brief marriage to <UNK> williams in the early fifties and his eventual divorce from della <UNK> in 1977 it also plays down the extent of his <UNK> and the number of his <UNK> children there are similarities here with a beautiful mind which also <UNK> a number of controversial details about its <UNK> personal life including a divorce br br fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him <UNK> on account of jamie <UNK> oscar winning performance in the title role <UNK> <UNK> mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man even though foxx himself is <UNK> unlike <UNK> phoenix in walk the line however foxx did not do his own singing <UNK> <UNK> distinctive singing voice was too difficult to <UNK> he receives good support from some of the other performers particularly sharon warren as <UNK> and <UNK> washington as della <UNK> the film is uneven and overlong but nevertheless rewarding 7 10
<START> the title role of this western is played by robert walker jr he's a young gun who with partner david carradine gets separated after doing a contract hit on a mexican general in <UNK> their <UNK> carradine and walker become separated walker comes upon the camp of <UNK> robert mitchum who takes a liking to walker and makes him a <UNK> and <UNK> project of sorts br br this is the first of two films robert mitchum did with writer director burt kennedy the second was the more humorous the good guys and the bad guys br br not that young billy young does not have its moments of hilarity but it is a story involving the walker <UNK> <UNK> hunt for the bad who killed his son and a romantic triangle involving mitchum angie dickinson and town boss jack kelly br br the film <UNK> with <UNK> david carradine is john's son dean <UNK> daughter <UNK> is in this walker is the son of robert walker and jennifer jones and <UNK> son chris plays <UNK> son in some silent flashbacks br br robert mitchum got his start in westerns and always looks right at home in them angie dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in <UNK> bravo walker had a brief career playing rebellious <UNK> and doing a good job at it i've often wondered what happened to him he looks <UNK> like his father maybe he didn't want to come to such a tragic early end like his father br br and it that wasn't enough mitchum fans get to hear old eyes sing the title song at the beginning of the film
<START> i'm out of words to describe the beauty of the <UNK> are flying but i'll try anyway to write about it it's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the second world war it's the classic story of lovers boris <UNK> separated by the war and of what comes between them the film's images are so gorgeous that you'll be carried away the film technique is in perfect <UNK> with the emotion br br there are few scenes that portray directly the war a bombing wind <UNK> explosions that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist <UNK> who waits for the return of boris and there's another scene on the front where we we will be confronted by a emotional visual <UNK> showing the images played in <UNK> mind another scene works as the <UNK> of the film and provides its title the <UNK> flying in the sky this image stands as a the symbol for nature and its seasons and <UNK> the final message of the film not to give up hope and fight for a better future br br is a great director this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply it is not just pure technique br br is perfect as <UNK> what more can i say the film <UNK> the time it was made the action takes place during the second world war but it could have happened anytime anywhere as long there are wars great or small the film and its message will remain relevant
<START> the story line of a man's love for an innocent baby he finds with a <UNK> face and on the opposite side of the world a shallow self centered valley girl who shares a birth date with her and ends up making a big difference in both of there lives what a great and worthy story line but in this telling the screen writing and or directing and or editing is so poor as to take most of the joy out of the story linda <UNK> character goes from understanding mom to wicked witch and back faster than a <UNK> bullet and for what purpose conflict conflict conflict at the drop of a hat katie the california girl and her boyfriend mom and everybody including the poor lady at the airport check in counter <UNK> adopted father who is the <UNK> most <UNK> man alive and his wife and <UNK> son all in constant conflict i really wanted to enjoy a heartwarming story but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hate and fighting were over there were too many unexplained or illogical events many of which don't add to the story my wife and i kept looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story could be <UNK> up so badly
<START> i don't care what anyone else says this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film what was john <UNK> thinking br br i know it's based on a series of children's books but c'mon even kids hate this movie it's pointless and boring tom arnold once again <UNK> demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money br br i think the only reason the hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k
<START> eaten alive follows a young woman janet who <UNK> for her lost sister turns out her sister have joined a <UNK> that has disappeared into the <UNK> of <UNK> with vietnam veteran mark at her side she sets off to find her sister br br as per usual the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl me me <UNK> spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare female lead janet covered in gold paint and abused with a <UNK> <UNK> in snake blood among other things now that's gotta count for something br br but i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title if you are fan of the genre you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a <UNK> few and i mean that literally a lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other cannibal movies like man from deep river and last cannibal world there's probably more movies stuck in there br br ultimately this is one for die hard fans to check off their list if you haven't seen any italian jungle movies you'd be better off watching cannibal holocaust and if you're an avid fan you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies
<START> a western through and through as the title character portrayed by glenn ford says no i don't want to fight but i will if it's forced on me this movie is about being intelligent strong and fighting for one's beliefs with courage never stop <UNK> for what you feel is right great action and mostly quick paced good to see brian keith in this role and edward g robinson as an older western man glenn ford lives up to his western image thoroughly enjoyable film includes <UNK> non military <UNK> of course it's violent like the title states but not too graphic like in the computer generated era films it's mostly about strong personality <UNK>
<START> i just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors i really don't understand where all the positive reviews came from the animation is clunky and <UNK> the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film i have never read the book so i can't say if the movie was faithful but as with most movie adaptations it tries too hard to <UNK> as much information into the <UNK> amount of time possible the result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesn't really let you understand or relate to the characters or actually anything at all overall i felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where i couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to them and the only way i can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a scooby doo cartoon
<START> i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney i left the theater like many others before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer it was badly shot the sound sucks and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states this screams of a low budget high school production
<START> to keep from being bored during love and sex first i tried to think of all the movies this was of breaking up with russell <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> though that had a more original ending about last night with rob lowe and a lot of tv shows br br second was <UNK> just how gorgeous <UNK> is so i couldn't believe for a <UNK> that she could have a problem getting a date she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money literally and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other br br third was trying to figure out why the writer director bothered to give jon character the jewish name of adam levy he even refers to eating a ham <UNK> br br fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater br br originally written 9 2 2000
<START> david master of <UNK> niven plays the big boss <UNK> who <UNK> upon the unfortunate richard jordan <UNK> by forcing the hapless ex con to exploit his ill found new position in a bank <UNK> <UNK> miss <UNK> most effectively provides the female interest whom <UNK> cannot simply cannot resist br br it seems they were unable to decide on one name for this film so instead they used four makes sense br br sadly this turn out to be one of <UNK> last roles br br overall this film is fun and well worth watching if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night tv <UNK> br br
<START> a virtual <UNK> copy of the cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot i knew the movie was going downhill when i saw the fake <UNK> lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors the conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence the acting wasn't as bad as the typical b movie and there was some believability in their fear but as professional they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession overall not worth wasting 4 50 to rent
<START> the two leads an <UNK> and an aussie filming an american civil war story in romania have not the slightest spark between them are utterly unbelievable as lovers and wholly unsympathetic there is no story no characterization virtually nothing to keep the <UNK> separated during this interminable bore fest <UNK> also hopelessly miscast practically <UNK> the fence <UNK> but at least watching her embarrass herself provides some comic relief nicole kidman is a decade too old for the role and has not the slightest idea what's going on jude <UNK> moron role could have been played equally as well by any of the romanian extras the only <UNK> is to wander about the forest looking stupid while watching a parade of guest stars steal the show not that it <UNK> because all of the guest star roles were completely unnecessary as they did not advance the so called plot by one <UNK> and as if all that wasn't enough the auteur felt it necessary to throw in some spinning <UNK> kung fu jumping off horses what was that about
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant and is one of the best film and camera guys in the business so it should come as no surprise that x is an almost perfect filming of the most gut wrenching story ever seriously if i could have figured out some way to climb inside my video <UNK> i would have <UNK> pierre to within an inch of his life no one has the right to be that self absorbed and that stupid both at the same time except maybe <UNK> in emily <UNK> <UNK> heights after spending <UNK> minutes with pierre i need a large glass of <UNK> never have i been so angry at a main character ok having said that x is a stunning movie with one of the few totally honest sex scenes i've ever seen in any film which means another piece of brilliant filmmaking and i'm talking graphic here by the way x will beat the hell out of you though so make sure you're up for it if you decide to watch it
<START> i think this movie was made as good as it could have been with only 4 months and a budget i'm surprised this wasn't worse if you are not to care about the cg or special effects this movie is great br br okay the movie is not that well made i'm sure it could have been but you try to do better in only 4 months but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting br br don't trust me when i say that this movie is good cause i also find the 1933 king kong to be good br br i must confess that i didn't watch the complete movie either i might have fast <UNK> some minutes here and there
<START> spanish director luis <UNK> career <UNK> almost 50 years from <UNK> to 1977 arguably his best films were those he made during his <UNK> in mexico from the late forties to the early 60s there he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry interested mainly in <UNK> commercial movies to <UNK> audiences yet he somehow managed to make interesting thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time this movie is based on a novel by spanish author <UNK> <UNK> and the adaptation is quite faithful even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain the protagonist is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one <UNK> by christ the question many would ask is whether such <UNK> would be possible without <UNK> in the <UNK> and mockery of your fellow human beings as it happens he suffers a lot of <UNK> yet he remains stubborn until the controversial final shot to this objective i think <UNK> wanted to show as a somewhat ridiculous figure but perhaps inadvertently his <UNK> at least to this viewer comes out as admirable in any case a great film
<START> i adore the <UNK> version of phantom and i appreciate <UNK> version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects <UNK> i don't <UNK> of the fact that andrew lloyd <UNK> made the relationship between <UNK> and christine less restrained br br luckily since this is a comedic short with only <UNK> and christine this version doesn't even have to bother with any other characters br br i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up performance i was dead wrong leslie <UNK> is fabulous as <UNK> though of course this is a spoof it's still brilliant br br i especially appreciated the fact that <UNK> looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that other than br br however i do not recommend this short if you don't like spoofs because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously
<START> for many the hit series was ten years of pitch black humour loaded with <UNK> parodies of classic films and a hilarious assortment of over a hundred characters with instantly <UNK> <UNK> few shows have survived transition from radio to tv to stage show to film but the league of gentlemen have achieved it with suitable <UNK> br br the talented writer performers had initially <UNK> a monty python style medieval adventure but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better with that the <UNK> <UNK> folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the <UNK> town and work on a <UNK> century romp instead br br with the exception of michael sheen playing much unseen league member jeremy <UNK> the league play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life <UNK> as well as the familiar faces of <UNK> i made a little brown <UNK> nightmare inducing sexual predator <UNK> butcher <UNK> <UNK> and an unlikely hero <UNK> businessman <UNK> new faces appear when the third reality appears it's here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular tv stars for many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes br br is not going to please everyone though working on this level of post <UNK> has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony <UNK> teen <UNK> kick started by the likes of wes craven having a new nightmare it also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know comedy as a genre is formulaic but it's now <UNK> of for a british film not to fall back on the huge back <UNK> of tv stars to fill short amounts of screen time it's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their <UNK> killed off which is perhaps why some of the role <UNK> doesn't always quite hit the mark would <UNK> <UNK> have wanted to try save <UNK> <UNK> in the series br br however while the show's deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it much will be said about the character development and efforts to <UNK> the likes of previously one joke <UNK> like <UNK> it is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs sentiment is there with a <UNK> in the throat but not sugar <UNK> <UNK> enough to <UNK> on the action the music is good performances <UNK> and the animation is wonderfully <UNK> a nice <UNK> to terry gilliam and ray work in short there's a lot to like about the apocalypse like so many tv to film <UNK> it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the <UNK> to the slick and distinct voice but no matter what your <UNK> is this last trip to the town which never <UNK> is oddly <UNK> with hope and ultimately very very touching
<START> what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network <UNK> who <UNK> this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid so <UNK> so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's cgi effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them with that <UNK> we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction well guess what the only mayhem we saw was in the ads <UNK> next episode what a let down but wait there was even a bigger one the script itself was the bigger disaster and then there was the direction and the <UNK> acting by everyone involved in this turkey but we knew this before right we knew that effects alone do not an entertainment make but yet the network <UNK> who this tv movie didn't care about that because in their <UNK> is the <UNK> line never <UNK> how stupid the audience are these guys must actually live by this <UNK> and i am so fed up of it no wonder the audience has abandoned us drama in <UNK> and pitched their camp in reality shows at least in those programs no one is trying to make it look like anything different from what it is intellectual pornography well category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and original yes this was a disaster movie alright but the disasters are not what they advertised
<START> i just watched descent what an awful movie right off the bat they depict a <UNK> <UNK> and a note says that it is miles below the the surface of washington state folks there are no <UNK> deep in the earth like that they thought it looked neat and in typical hollywood style they threw it in and then there is that well that <UNK> <UNK> he dropped a stone and i heard a <UNK> steam would have <UNK> out of that well before a blast of <UNK> could if ever br br and the acting was pretty bad as well micheal <UNK> has sunk to a new low in jobs br br what a dog of a movie i bet the vote goes no higher than a 3 5 br br it didn't look like scifi channel spent too much other than to have pretty boy perry as an attempt to draw
<START> why did they not follow the book i am really sad and disappointed i was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book maybe recently it might be very difficult to remain objective my wife had not read the book and she loved the movie br br reasons for the disappointment are 1 involvement gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the <UNK> is created but even that does not stick to the facts why not the fact that father was burned with the first brand which is how <UNK> got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie 2 story line between the deceased <UNK> and completely gone this completely <UNK> up the motive for the stealing of the <UNK> 3 story line between <UNK> and completely non existent br br all in all too <UNK> storyline and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it maybe i should <UNK> this film in 10 years time when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid br br really sorry for the negative review which was <UNK> by expectations
<START> this movie is a clumsy <UNK> of various ghost story and suspense thriller conventions none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating the script was <UNK> the acting <UNK> the scary fx were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat <UNK> moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off now explain to me someone why you would need ghosts and black magic and <UNK> ritual objects and count cg and psychic <UNK> and family <UNK> and irish <UNK> and <UNK> of milk left out for the supernatural beings and possessed all in the same movie with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror but this movie is lame lame lame
<START> navy <UNK> is an ignorant racist and <UNK> movie which <UNK> uses the middle east conflict as the backdrop for an action flick <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> american mid west audience the conflict as well as those involved is used simply as cannon fodder to <UNK> the <UNK> young americans who proudly kill <UNK> for the good of <UNK> but what is worse is that the film's action scenes are <UNK> handled and <UNK> which <UNK> navy <UNK> from working even as a mindless shoot 'em up br br charlie <UNK> character <UNK> is disgusting obnoxious ignorant reckless and above all racist he refers to the middle east as a 's t <UNK> and to its inhabitants as <UNK> throughout the film the navy characters are <UNK> through the use of the <UNK> natives as cannon fodder they <UNK> massacre these people with a consequence free attitude there is even the tasteless murder of a young <UNK> boy who is shot by <UNK> <UNK> makes fun of his language before shooting him whilst making another humorous <UNK> besides being tasteless this should be <UNK> the film's extreme though predictable pro american stance is also revolting this can be seen when the <UNK> american female journalist informs <UNK> that terrorists cant be made to talk because <UNK> are religious <UNK> ' <UNK> then <UNK> with <UNK> and we are the navy <UNK> ' the <UNK> is obviously that <UNK> are meaningless next to american military might moreover even after insulting this <UNK> racial <UNK> and treating her like a sex object the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she still ends up sleeping with him because he is an all american navy seal this <UNK> the <UNK> character by making her <UNK> to the pro american attitude of <UNK> despite his insulting behaviour toward her beyond <UNK> this plot twist also has little <UNK> as drama br br the screenplay is also amateurish most scenes are simply strung together without any thought for mood plot or character development the <UNK> <UNK> scene at the golf course for example is just <UNK> edited eye candy and the two scenes where charlie sheen plays the reckless hero are also pointless in one he jumps off a bridge from moving car just to show his mates how tough he is and in the other he chases down a <UNK> truck on a push bike and drives his car off it neither scene has a follow up anti climax both are highly improbable and neither has any bearing on the plot as a whole they are just candy designed as a vehicle to showcase <UNK> cheap all american <UNK> and are poor <UNK> for character development most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly scripted as in fact this <UNK> affects the entire movie apart from the african american navy seal and his wife as well as the characters of michael <UNK> and charlie sheen every other member of the team seems unknown to the audience so that when the climatic scenes roll around there seems to nobody to root for and <UNK> death to <UNK> br br in such a film the action sequences can potentially rescue the production but here they don't these are badly directed badly lit and showcase badly performed stunts in fact their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer resulting in not only the scenes being <UNK> hard to follow but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense poor lighting only adds to their <UNK> the explosions look fake <UNK> wounds unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts involving crashing a <UNK> over a tank looks just like a stunt which has been staged on a <UNK> and then poorly edited br br the ending of navy <UNK> places the <UNK> firmly on the eyes of this production first there is the obligatory slow motion away from the big explosion that should have killed <UNK> scene with sheen carrying <UNK> on his back this was obviously the <UNK> scene intended to be the star of the movie's trailers then there is the ending itself when the of the seal team wounded and floating in the ocean are rescued by a submarine this submarine had in fact turned for home long before but of course it had miraculously returned in the nick of time <UNK> it all of despite the violent and <UNK> ordeal and despite the fact that numerous of their colleagues had just been killed with a number of them still bleeding <UNK> they all manage to laugh <UNK> while <UNK> america predictable you can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits br br this movie <UNK> uses the middle eastern conflict as a vehicle for the macho all american <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> young leads <UNK> are treated <UNK> and <UNK> and their slaughter in the movie is used as a to <UNK> the use of american military might against an <UNK> minority group in a consequence free environment the events of 2001 have pointed out that such smug and <UNK> <UNK> of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free the middle east can no longer be written off as a s t hole full of <UNK> heads knocking each other off to quote charlie sheen here it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can <UNK> themselves quite close to home therefore in the very least navy <UNK> looks pretty foolish these days but this is to be kind this is a highly ignorant movie whose production values and <UNK> are equally suspect navy <UNK> is <UNK> and artistically a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience
<START> i thought this was a very daring representation of the old hokey <UNK> concept made so popular by hollywood <UNK> et al br br yes there is a lot of silly stuff but then the idea is silly it is almost unbelievable that a human baby could be <UNK> to <UNK> by <UNK> i am tempted to say completely unbelievable but that the concept has never been tried and there is certainly a bit too much <UNK> for comfort though under the circumstances i can see how that would be very difficult to avoid we also now have a much greater insight into the issues of and know that a human raised from <UNK> without human <UNK> <UNK> would ultimately never learn them in <UNK> br br still if you can get your head around that lot there's a great deal to admire that is both imaginative and daring <UNK> does the beast thing with tremendous <UNK> i am tempted to say that it is the most convincing and sympathetic role i have seen him play there are plenty of other excellent performances too not least of which are sir ralph richardson and ian <UNK> br br what is particularly disturbing and rightly so is the <UNK> perception of humans we get to see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor dumb helpless <UNK> over whom we so <UNK> lord it and it demonstrates well how the phony and with which we cloak and justify our conduct is no more than an expression of own <UNK> and arrogance it may seem a little <UNK> at times especially in the hideous museum <UNK> rooms but what we see isn't just a truth about the <UNK> its a truth about the way we are today it's one that needs to be stated and cannot be stated often enough <UNK> character's obsession with the <UNK> as a <UNK> of <UNK> as if to possess facial hair were a primitive condition to be <UNK> is an excellent case in point primitive <UNK> readers take note br br the story is depressing ultimately it's a tragedy because even though he returns to the jungle and the freedom from moral <UNK> that is truly human we know he's doomed before the third millennium is 50 years old wild <UNK> will be hunted into <UNK> as bush meat and their environment developed for <UNK> and <UNK> exploitation to <UNK> human excess br br in the end it's a tale about ourselves the path to <UNK> that other <UNK> <UNK> must eventually be followed by humans br br highly recommended for its <UNK> take despite the hokey moments
<START> normally i hate period films living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an <UNK> to period dramas which i do however this one is the best it doesn't take itself seriously and <UNK> lee miller and robert <UNK> are great together <UNK> <UNK> good as well although her english accent is dodgy br br the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves it has action adventure drama and comedy i'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film it shows that english film makers can produce something that doesn't involve constant swearing and sex both do feature in this but in a balanced format <UNK> camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious br br as the trailer for 'the spy who <UNK> <UNK> is to say if you see one other film this spring make it and it's got fun action and of course <UNK> lee miller with an english accent for a change
<START> i should no longer be surprised when critics miss the most obvious things in works of art because they are human beings and the vast majority of human beings are lazy by nature that said the simplistic notion that <UNK> <UNK> great 1968 film shame or is merely an anti war film does a great deal of damage to the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film compared to its more <UNK> predecessors persona and hour of the wolf shame is seemingly a more classic film in terms of narrative but the key word is seemingly for while it lacks the <UNK> pop <UNK> of persona and the <UNK> horror film <UNK> of hour of the wolf it is one of the best films ever made about war and not as an anti war film nor a pro war film as such it has to rank with wild <UNK> as one of his greatest films as well as one of his best screenplays if not the best br br although ostensibly a more psychologically exterior film than the films that <UNK> it it truly says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive in it max von <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> play jan and eva <UNK> perhaps a nod at the infamous american spies whom many european <UNK> felt were innocent two musicians who used to play for the local <UNK> orchestra before a war broke out and they <UNK> to live on a small plot of land on an island content to working in a <UNK> the country they live in is <UNK> as is the island they live on although the film was made on <UNK> small island of just off the northern end of the swedish island of it seems that their nation has been at war for some years with an <UNK> country or perhaps engaged in a civil war with rebels from another <UNK> this is all left deliberately <UNK> as this war is meant to <UNK> all wars this is <UNK> as the film starts with <UNK> war quotes on the screen as the credits roll these include quotes from hitler to vietnam era american military figures after early scenes that depict the <UNK> nature of their rural life and then the coming of war where even old men are <UNK> an <UNK> attack <UNK> the land as enemy <UNK> fly <UNK> dropping bombs and what seems to be chemical weapons of an agent orange like nature one plane is hit and a jumps out and ends up hanging in a tree jan who starts off the film as a <UNK> coward refuses to go and help so eva goes alone jan joins her and they find the pilot has been shot it seems he is indeed part of the <UNK> or possibly rebel force a bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot then advise the couple to leave their home as the <UNK> are there are the <UNK> of the film on a <UNK> level such as that of bergman <UNK> marc <UNK> who provides the film commentary on the dvd of the film like many other critics he claims that <UNK> is a who has <UNK> with the <UNK> but this is clearly and <UNK> wrong for <UNK> is with the original fascist government as proof first off the <UNK> are <UNK> after they <UNK> the land and shoot their <UNK> interview we know this because the government that later questions them of the <UNK> interview and words put into <UNK> mouth see the film as supposed proof of their <UNK> and <UNK> is clearly working with them the fascist big brother secondly <UNK> is in charge of deciding which of the <UNK> are sent to concentration camps for <UNK> with the <UNK> and the again are among those <UNK> <UNK> in his seduction of eva <UNK> tells her his son is on leave from the military and clearly if he was an <UNK> he would not be speaking so happily of his son serving the state also rebel forces are not official <UNK> and do not grant official leave lastly <UNK> is clearly with the rebels or <UNK> of the organization and why would he have killed a colleague br br that <UNK> and other critics so blatantly and <UNK> and flat out miss such a key and <UNK> point of this film brings into question their ability to <UNK> any and all aspects of all of <UNK> films this is a wonderful and great film and very high in the <UNK> <UNK> but it is disappointing to read how so few critics and viewers have really understand its complex message instead <UNK> out for the cheap lazy and easy claim of its being merely anti war and a rather simple film in comparison to its two predecessors and that in the long run is the real shame of shame
<START> <UNK> has to be among the best french films i have ever seen along with hatred also starring vincent <UNK> and those great gerard <UNK> pierre richard movies <UNK> and <UNK> are amazing in the leading roles aside from <UNK> of the wolves and <UNK> i have not yet seen a bad movie with this couple <UNK> sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end <UNK> storytelling really hasn't worked this well since pulp fiction let's just hope there won't be a <UNK> american remake of this unique romance mystery thriller edit guess what a <UNK> american remake has been made
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer <UNK> around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as <UNK> as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by <UNK> i'll be writing those <UNK> down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> this is a funny clever film and well worth your time in my opinion it is much better than american pie and other films of the same genre that seem to get knocked out all the time i hadn't heard of this film so i guess it didn't get much press which is kind of a shame it doesn't take itself too seriously but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what is important as opposed to a film about a bunch of desperate guys trying to get laid for the first time and one dude sticking his d k in a pie but in the end everyone gets laid and <UNK> de do one thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy american pop punk they actually had real punk from back in the day like the ramones that in itself made the film better to be honest i wasn't expecting much from this film and i was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy it is
<START> well i guess i know the answer to that question for the money we have been so <UNK> with cat in the hat advertising and <UNK> that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie i admit i thought the trailers looked bad but i still had to give it a chance well i should have went with my instincts it was a complete piece hollywood trash once again proving that the average person can be <UNK> into believing anything they say is good must be good aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long it obviously started with a <UNK> eaten script it's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor and awful <UNK> <UNK> it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction this is then <UNK> with yes i'll say it bad acting i couldn't help but feel like i was watching coffee talk on snl every time mike myers opened his mouth was the cat intended to be a middle aged jewish woman spencer <UNK> and <UNK> fanning were no prize either but mr myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another austin powers movie f no stars 0 on a scale of 1 10 save your money
<START> over acted heavy handed full of speeches preachy on the nose and over stylized in a way only mtv could be guilty of stop loss is prop garbage i expected a lot more with talented young actors such as joseph gordon <UNK> and ryan <UNK> but screenwriter director <UNK> does a <UNK> job of portraying the ill effects of war on american youth i'm sure she did some work <UNK> the iraq war and the young men fighting in it but you'd never guess it from watching stop loss in many ways this mess reminded me of catherine <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> an equally inept overly stylized tv movie like waste of solid subject matter br br http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> just to save you the 3 or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store and the <UNK> hour and however long this movie is here's a simple plan go over to a friend's house talk them into renting the <UNK> for you watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave the opening sequence is really funny definitely worth watching unfortunately the other 99 of the movie is horrible without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time
<START> this is one of the most horrible <UNK> movies i've seen for awhile i had to wonder if john <UNK> davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie <UNK> looked like a cross between the from land of the lost and the creature from the black <UNK> additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the of legend is much smaller all in all however the movie was <UNK> bad it was funny why couldn't bullets and <UNK> stop the but the <UNK> kick boxing daughter do ok watch if you are sick at home or feeling down and need a good laugh
<START> definitely the best game for <UNK> ever i most say i was disappointed with tomorrow never dies but the world is not enough promises to be better then <UNK> according to the website i love <UNK> so much i find something to do every time i play it i have even made up my own missions for the levels multi player is the best of any game out there and the graphics are astounding even now the first day i got this i remember wishing that they would go back and make all of the bond movies into games can you imagine driving that speed boat in live and let die and making those incredible jumps or fighting off ninjas or fighting jaws in the spy who loved me and <UNK> i think fighting him in those games would be more fun then in the aztec what about chasing <UNK> in the gas <UNK> or st in for your eyes only oh well let me get back to the game at hand all of the levels are unique and make for very fun killing <UNK> there are many places to hide so you can <UNK> up on people especially statue park well this game is not worthy of renting you really need to buy it today
<START> i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions <UNK> of the main actress <UNK> nicholson i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted all the actors and actresses played well especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in <UNK> the future andy <UNK> who played carl i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions and the several <UNK> <UNK> is like the real world jay <UNK> who played ed the future husband also played very real behavior but i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions <UNK> which <UNK> nicholson is capable of and does so naturally was overwhelming for me indeed the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored it raises again and again in my thoughts
<START> despite the previous <UNK> <UNK> this is a well paced and interesting documentary with lots of clips from classic 1950s sci fi films that influenced spielberg lucas and others in their more recent efforts i agree that spielberg's films aren't even in the same league as the films discussed here such as william cameron <UNK> brilliant <UNK> from mars to name just one of the many titles examined but this is still a remarkably good <UNK> of 1950s paranoid sci fi yes it turns into a commercial for the tepid remake of war of the worlds during the last fifteen minutes you can turn that off the rest is surprisingly good and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remember the films that inspired them even if they can't begin to match the originals
<START> before seeing this film the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story i didn't enjoy that film very much but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a <UNK> tiresome fashion br br the actors don't shine the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases the only character of real interest for me was anthony intelligent <UNK> br br the so called plot is ridiculous but the story itself is a great one it's a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you live with an open mind and don't care what other people say you are what you are if others can't take it 'em <UNK> was told this early on but he didn't listen br br the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old <UNK> <UNK> story not in that same horrible level but in the way she <UNK> the child to create the of her personal <UNK> against the entire opposite sex she thought had <UNK> her childhood didn't appear much better the ending didn't seem to fit the rest of the story's style the sets looked cheap and coming to imdb i'm not surprised to see that this was indeed a tv movie which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the library br br live and learn so many good movies so little time that's why the reviews are here so you wouldn't have to waste your time on this sort of movies br br 3 10
<START> this thriller is one of the few film surprises i've had in quite some time everybody and i do mean everybody i talked to when it was in the theatres said it was awful but then i got to thinking none of these people really understand horror thriller films or metal rock so why do i listen to them in the first place this film kicks ass but only if you are able to comprehend and enjoy this type of entertainment in short too late see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind the <UNK> great too
<START> don't pick this one spoiler alert the plot of this <UNK> bad movie is four friends are talked into taking the <UNK> from the airport by a very <UNK> driver on the <UNK> with them is a rather <UNK> looking business type br br shortly into their trip the driver of the <UNK> takes an off <UNK> and some lunatic driver tries to run them off the road the end result is they get a flat tire the driver gets one of the people on the <UNK> to help change the tire and the jack slips and the guys fingers are crushed between the tire and the <UNK> it's at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a <UNK> and he has taken all the people hostage br br now the movie gets extremely slow and tedious as the characters do one lame thing after another one of the men is killed trying to escape even that lacks any suspense finally it is revealed that the <UNK> business guy is in <UNK> with the driver when <UNK> guy kills the other male friend by <UNK> his throat br br there are a couple of attempts to escape by the women <UNK> is beaten over the head with a tire iron yet he survives br br the driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head on <UNK> with a fence at high speed while <UNK> next to the <UNK> wheel somehow he didn't go through the window or even get seriously injured with a <UNK> with <UNK> yet the woman driving the <UNK> is knocked unconscious yet she had a <UNK> wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the <UNK> br br he is eventually able to <UNK> the women and get them to an underground garage that is a front for human <UNK> one of the women is killed the other one stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized piece of broken mirror and shoots him in the head yet he is able in what should be a severely <UNK> state severe blood loss two head <UNK> and a large leg <UNK> to drag her out of the <UNK> drag her to a large <UNK> throw her in and get it locked all the while with her <UNK> fighting him br br now some people admire the message of the movie about human <UNK> and how it is going on today this is a serious problem but making an extremely boring movie about the topic does not <UNK> it to a higher rating
<START> kevin spacey is a mental hospital patient who claims to be native to a distant planet called k <UNK> his psychiatrist dr mark powell jeff bridges tries to help him all the while trying to understand and find out if he is really from k <UNK> br br this movie doesn't really fall into any particular genre one big part of k <UNK> is drama science fiction another part fantasy plus add to that a dash of comedy and you begin to get what k <UNK> is all about the story as you see above isn't too complicated or deep but it still offers some good twists and turns of the plot that may still surprise you as they did me no special effects or graphics <UNK> this movie and there's no need to have them the music in the film is great however a <UNK> soundtrack along with a terrific piano piece makes k <UNK> sound sci fi and makes certain scenes intriguing br br kevin spacey is the heart of the movie and plays a very convincing alien from the planet k <UNK> emotional with great facial expressions spacey does a fine job in the lead role jeff bridges is dr powell that aids and attempts to understand bridges is also excellent in his part bridges and spacey fit together very well and they should after all they've both had a lot of experience the wife of dr powell is rachel powell played by mary <UNK> <UNK> plays her part well showing the frustration from having her husband gone and so dedicated to his patient <UNK> plays dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we don't really see <UNK> too much but overall she puts in an alright performance br br k <UNK> is rated pg 13 for a sequence of violent images and brief language and <UNK> and that covers it as far as violent images go we don't see too much a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but that's all language is as follows 1 f word wow only one 11 s words and a few uses of the <UNK> name in vain not too bad really the <UNK> part is just from when explains to dr powell how <UNK> works on k <UNK> nothing terrible just something about it feels like having your nuts in a vice not too bad on the content level for a pg 13 movie it could have been a lot worse br br in conclusion k <UNK> is not a bad movie it won't <UNK> you but it is enjoyable and kind of fun to watch it has some funny parts sad parts really sad parts and well you know what i mean it's a story of a mental hospital patient what do you expect all in all a good rent for those of you looking for a good drama that you can kick back and relax to k <UNK> is a well done movie br br bonus if you've seen this movie already like it and are thinking about getting the dvd i would highly recommend it it has loads of extras to look through and even an alternate ending and deleted scenes 8 10
<START> once a month i invite a few friends over for a retarded movie night we look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of <UNK> last night we were unfortunate enough to have zombie planet as one of our movies the cinematography is on par with what we're used to but the acting was a different story the lead role is played by a johnny <UNK> rob zombie wanna be who couldn't get a role in a high school play let alone a low budget horror film our <UNK> hero who couldn't tell whether or not he wanted to be a bad ass this scene or a <UNK> coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that i have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night it had the possibility for greatness with a great twist on the standard zombie <UNK> but they took it an entirely different direction based on johnny zombie i personally would not recommend this to any of my friends however it's unfortunate that i already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80 of this movie with me
<START> first i must say that i enjoyed the first underworld movie i was intrigued and curious to learn about vampires and and so forth in this last part hopefully of the series i just feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are at least in the first part you had the tight leather clothes now vampires seem like <UNK> victims of bad <UNK> control problem they look and act like <UNK> white <UNK> humans br br some ideas were neat the whole thing with human <UNK> was interesting pity the acting was abysmal the slave <UNK> too was <UNK> br br other things just hit me as pathetic spoilers now castle walls that can be jumped over in a few steps enemies that don't attack during the day big bad ancient vampires that take ages to join combat and then run away from a <UNK> leader after a minute or so werewolves that <UNK> close to their enemies that raid for what they don't use <UNK> and swords or armor a vampire leader so inept he manages to have just about everyone against him the romance is so unconvincing its sad br br so i don't recommend this film unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket some of the action is good to ok certainly the vampires armor and weapons are interesting otherwise a very weak script that was badly put together and uses all sorts of inane plot twists
<START> burt reynolds directed this action movie and surprise he is actually a pretty good director this movie starts off well as <UNK> attempted bust of a drug dealer is <UNK> and he is down to the vice squad the ensemble cast has some pretty funny scenes as brian <UNK> is always eating something <UNK> <UNK> has more class than all of his co workers combined and charles <UNK> loses control of his squad br br the vice cops stumble on a high <UNK> call girl ring that may have something to do with a series of murders spends days <UNK> out rachel ward apartment and starts to really adore her from <UNK> br br just when they are getting close to the crime leader is murdered i won't give away any of the surprises in the plot but the first hour of this film is great br br unfortunately the screenplay gets very clichéd and unbelievable after that br br why would burt reynolds confront the crime boss with his big secret sure it makes the guy sweat but it causes many more cops to be killed and it is not believable that and would make love after they have know each other for one day much less while their lives are in danger and at the end what happened to all the police that run into the building with our heroes isn't there a <UNK> team also the film never actually tells you how all of the bad guys are connected and why they have to kill so many people br br there is a very effective torture scene on a boat near the end of the film which is probably the only really nail biting scene of the film it is a shame that the climax is a typical shoot em up still this film is certainly entertaining if you like crime and action movies don't think about the plot holes and you will have a good time
<START> while <UNK> <UNK> was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a <UNK> evening than the pub i did leave pleased that i had got buy one get one free tickets knowing nothing about the film as i went in in fact i didn't even know there was an animated series before i read this site i was ready for anything and as some other viewers noted the trailers showing a well filmed good looking and interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in half way through the film though i was kind of disappointed it did remind me of the fifth element but i too feel it just lacked the extra bit of depth and left me with the empty feeling and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fights if you're going to do them do it with some style not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down personally i'd rather have seen a bit more about the story and the people in the city or got to know more about how the <UNK> was being <UNK> than yet another long and loud gun fight
<START> this is a known fact mr seagal cannot smile he can act he can kick butt there are faint smiles no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie we see an over weight mr seagal as dr wesley <UNK> who is in desperate need of a <UNK> and his real daughter made an appearance as his office assistant story okay so wesley lives in another darn <UNK> with his sweet daughter holly they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and and on the other end of town some over weight <UNK> leader decides to make the whole town sick by <UNK> a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an <UNK> problem there is no <UNK> and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while the cia are <UNK> and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill daughter holly so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather who is a native indian together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time and to <UNK> the moment neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus hmm one weak fight scene terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a <UNK> master
<START> i went into this movie with an open mind i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie and my friend returned with this i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise we kept watching just hoping it would get better but no a <UNK> mind rape followed br br this movie was probably one of the worse ever committed to film and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100 i really don't know how this got distributed the lighting was poor i have seen better acting in <UNK> school plays there is really nothing positive to say about it
<START> i rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering i like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was i wrong the acting <UNK> the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didn't cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead i noticed some people gave it a 10 why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse a 10 you can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy you have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't <UNK> maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to <UNK> people you're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do if the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie i gave this movie a 4 and am glad that i was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isn't worth paying a <UNK> to see
<START> it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good hard indeed but this one makes him look good very good actually it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a <UNK> performance br br the acting from the entire ensemble <UNK> to rise above the <UNK> and failed the fault was in part let us be fair that the plot bore as much resemblance to the <UNK> wells original as did the butchered <UNK> of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors both were <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of more attractive predecessor but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the <UNK> my this kitchen has a remarkable lot of holes unless that is holes are your bag in which case this film will <UNK> itself to you br br the fault in the other part was that these were <UNK> <UNK> dvd actors who knew full well one assumes that this was their <UNK> that would wind up on the 5 dvd shelf and <UNK> at that br br so should you watch it why yes of course you should you are a miserable <UNK> and deserve punishment
<START> i first saw this movie on an <UNK> <UNK> flight and have since seen it twice more it simply is and is simply one of the best films in years i found myself having enjoyed it after my first viewing but a little <UNK> on what had happened after seeing it again a few weeks later things began to fall into place it wasn't confusing just deep in fact the depth of the movie may not be appreciated for a long time for example it occurred to me only after my third viewing that sammy davis jr jr <UNK> dog is more than just a pet perhaps she's the stand in for his dead wife witness how <UNK> he <UNK> her there is symbolism <UNK> and none of it sappy or indulgent just real the adventure of their trip keeps the story line in <UNK> motion and even when they arrive you're not sure if it really was the destination as the movie continues so does the adventure and i got the sense the destination was merely a way point the sound track is fun the scenery compelling and both decidedly eastern block i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but i'm not entirely sure i've discovered all the nuances yet besides it's more fun to <UNK> these out yourself as much as any film can be everything is <UNK> has proved to be like a fine wine that with time i highly recommend seeing it twice
<START> i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing fun filled thought provoking movie the absence of sex <UNK> and violence made for a most pleasant evening i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene but that's probably because i live a short distance from there even so this film could have been produced in any city it's the theme that's so important here i'm just grateful that <UNK> from heaven dropped down on us try it you'll like it
<START> i was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the far cry game had been created the story here is not something i would consider to be a strong point in the game universe no <UNK> though as in typical boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on now i understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke it has been said a million times before but why couldn't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie
<START> a documentary about a <UNK> tribe in <UNK> going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing but this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast <UNK> you <UNK> of a rapidly <UNK> <UNK> of humanity the <UNK> the epic songs and poetry the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique <UNK> of life are something the west had in the times of homer but that is now unfortunately completely foreign to most of us in the developed world we have lost the spiritual <UNK> that comes from following well established <UNK> of life often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society the film makers have woven us <UNK> into the fabric of these <UNK> poor but <UNK> rich and <UNK> and made us see that there was more to life than the shopping mall and pop culture so <UNK> your land lines turn off your cells turn off the <UNK> lights and sit back and ease yourself into a timeless adventure
<START> i find it remarkable that so little was actually done with the story of the a bomb and it's development for decades after the manhattan project was completed my suspicion is that this was due to serious fears in the movie and entertainment <UNK> in the 1950s through the 1970s with <UNK> and related national security <UNK> including the hollywood <UNK> there was one film in the 1950s with robert taylor about <UNK> paul who flew the gay in the <UNK> bombing but otherwise nothing else one could glance at a side issue tragedy the sinking of the u s s <UNK> soon after the delivery of the bombs to in robert <UNK> description of the shark attacks on the survivors in jaws but the actual trials and <UNK> of <UNK> and their team was not considered film able br br and then in 1989 two films appeared i have reviewed one already day one which i feel is the better of the two in discussing the lengthy technical and emotional and political problems in the manhattan project the acting of brian <UNK> as general and david as <UNK> was first rate and neatly balanced small side vignettes concerning the anti bomb <UNK> of michael tucker help fill out the story well br br that's the problem here paul newman is a great actor as is mr <UNK> but newman approached in a different way that while not dreadful is lesser than intelligent but soft spoken military <UNK> newman seems too popped eyed about the possibility of the weapon as the biggest stick to confront the other boys in the after school yard with yes it certainly was but the real would have been more like <UNK> keeping his mind not on that great toy of the future but on the business of creating that great toy br br dwight performance as helps maintain the film's basically interesting and good production aided by bonnie <UNK> as his wife but the most interesting aspect of this film is in the <UNK> of the two <UNK> of and in particular the latter in the character of john <UNK> <UNK> inevitably in all technological advances people are killed it's just that these two <UNK> on top of the <UNK> of thousands that were lost in <UNK> and <UNK> brought home the dangers of the new unleashed power even in a so called peaceful controlled experiment the two <UNK> particularly louis slow <UNK> death by radiation <UNK> showed how much care was needed in using atomic power and how the <UNK> of chances could still cause disaster the only really different thing i saw in <UNK> performance and the script and the actual incident with was that actually took some time after the accident to figure out where all his fellow research scientists were when they were hit by the radiation from the accident he was able to show that only he got the full effect of the accidental blast so that only relatively minor treatment would be needed by the others perhaps the full story of actions was too technical for the screen but given the <UNK> pain he suffered in the end that he took time off to think of the others shows what a first rate person he really was
<START> i've never made one of these before but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about it br br i'm all for independent film making as the past year has seen of the worst in my opinion of hollywood's <UNK> the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation br br the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with the direction is horrible the plotting is horrible the plot itself is horrible stay away far away only one brief scene featuring a <UNK> nude breasts and even that wasn't worth a second look br br the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was <UNK> it earns one point for each of those traits
<START> i have never seen the original 1930s version of the film but this remake is one of the worst i have seen from a major production studio in years seeing actors such as meg ryan and <UNK> <UNK> once near a level talents <UNK> their way through poorly scripted roles is painful there appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film br br <UNK> <UNK> smith and debra messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value <UNK> <UNK> smith's character is used as nothing more than a <UNK> to appear modern having an african american lesbian character but in <UNK> she is there to just look cool there is no actual reason why messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original i take br br the side characters played by eva <UNK> and <UNK> are stereotypical female characters with <UNK> portraying the <UNK> looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and covering the <UNK> roles br br the movie is boring lacking charm humor or sympathy for any characters it almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved whether in front of or behind the camera br br there is one <UNK> hope in the film however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film in the small role that she has
<START> when you watch a seagal movie you expect good action you expect fighting not just a lot of shooting like in this flick and you expect a rather simple story ok i can live with a more complex story even though it's a seagal movie but this one this is i don't know what to say it's very very confusing indeed at the end of the movie i had major problems <UNK> out what had happened and i know i'm not the only one the story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it's nearly impossible to keep track of what's happening in the movie there are many people in the movie people change sides all the time and it switches locations too often terrible i just don't understand why it looks like seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one
<START> hi this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the day when i watched this movie i was having high fever but still i watched the movie with lots of patience and after watching the movie i felt like <UNK> because i wasted 3 <UNK> for this stupid movie i could have taken rest rather then watching this movie and i was really surprised that how come actors like sunny <UNK> akshay kumar etc acted in this movie br br i don't understand if directors don't find a good story to make a film then why do they remain as directors why can't they sit at home and spent their time at home br br i request to all directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences either by mail or by media <UNK> <UNK> etc to send them a nice story if they don't find any good story for to make a film i request again to all directors please don't make such films
<START> this royal <UNK> basically had the message of wrestling these days gimmick and image are more popular then wrestling ability br br <UNK> vs edge pretty good match a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a <UNK> again and what better way to go into a match with <UNK> it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual overall this match gets a 6 10 undertaker vs not a good match undertaker had to carry through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves it did get interesting to see gene and a bit later kane come into this match overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended 2 10 kurt angle vs <UNK> vs big show this match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when angle managed to speed up the match kurt angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match <UNK> and big show put on a slow match the ending to this match was bad over all this match was a 5 10 because of kurt angle randy <UNK> vs <UNK> good match surprising heat for randy <UNK> who was the face in this match randy proved he can go the limit with any top star this match also marked the first match <UNK> has <UNK> where someone <UNK> run down and save him from a loss over all this match was about a 6 10 br br royal <UNK> match was ok some surprises some not so good surprises i was kind of upset that kurt angle wasn't given enough time in this match but over all this match had a guy who i never thought would be pushed so soon i won't tell ya who wins i give this match a 8 10
