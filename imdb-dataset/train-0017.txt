<START> the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way note that this change need not be positive or <UNK> at the end br br by that measure enchanted april is a <UNK> success as a film in general it succeeds quite well excellent ensemble cast well developed characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are first rate three must be mentioned <UNK> lawrence jim <UNK> and joan <UNK> it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further <UNK> <UNK> not
<START> i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of 70's rock i hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years br br bill <UNK> gives an excellent performance as the off <UNK> lead singer trying to <UNK> that old spirit br br stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the <UNK> trying to hold the band together but not <UNK> well br br if you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you won't regret seeing this movie i know i don't even my family found it funny and that's saying something
<START> imagine that you could have anything you wanted go anywhere you wished be anything you'd ever <UNK> of being through thought alone now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life what would you do would such powers be worth your soul this is the dilemma presented to captain christopher <UNK> in the cage the now legendary pilot episode of the original star trek series <UNK> deemed too cerebral and too cold by nbc <UNK> and rejected the cage was nevertheless the most ambitious and <UNK> pilot ever made in the history of the network at the time and gene <UNK> did not want to let all that effort and expense go to waste with the result being this truly classic star trek episode which <UNK> the cage into a frame story which <UNK> and <UNK> the emotional and philosophical depth of this haunting tale a landmark in tv history and one of the first truly serious sci fi stories ever filmed for the small screen star date <UNK> the <UNK> enterprise <UNK> to <UNK> 11 after mr spock receives an <UNK> message from the former commander of the enterprise surprisingly the message cannot be from captain <UNK> after all as he is now confined to a wheelchair mute and horribly <UNK> after a tragic accident kirk and <UNK> commanding officer <UNK> <UNK> attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery but before the matter can be <UNK> up spock for reasons as yet unknown commits an act of open <UNK> kidnapping the helpless captain <UNK> and <UNK> the enterprise via a brilliantly thought out and timed plan aided by a few <UNK> nerve <UNK> soon the enterprise is headed for the remote forbidden planet of <UNK> iv <UNK> informs kirk that <UNK> iv is under <UNK> and any contact with the planet by <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> carries an immediate death sentence meaning that spock appears to be deliberately destroying himself and kirk as well given that the captain will be held responsible for the <UNK> activities appalled kirk and <UNK> give chase in a <UNK> which itself becomes dangerous when the enterprise refuses to answer their calls or pick up the craft until power and <UNK> are nearly gone spock knowing that kirk must be the one following the ship is of course unable to <UNK> the captain to certain death after <UNK> the craft to be <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> aboard spock reveals what he has done to mccoy and demands to be arrested after having set the starship on an <UNK> course to <UNK> iv upon <UNK> command kirk demands an explanation <UNK> spock <UNK> immediate court martial by a <UNK> of <UNK> commanding officers of whom there are three on board <UNK> kirk and the crippled <UNK> captain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> knowledge of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> him to manipulate the <UNK> into allowing him to present otherwise <UNK> evidence spock presents video <UNK> of the only contact ever made between the <UNK> and the inhabitants of <UNK> iv a journey taken 13 years earlier by the enterprise itself under <UNK> command kirk expresses doubts about the authenticity of the video due to its extreme detail but the reality of the events depicted is confirmed by <UNK> himself who turns out to have been <UNK> to <UNK> iv by a distress call from the alleged survivors of a <UNK> research <UNK> which crashed there 18 years previously among the survivors is <UNK> a stunning beauty said to have been born just before the disaster <UNK> is attracted to the girl and allows her to lure him to an isolated spot <UNK> he is <UNK> and captured by the <UNK> a race of <UNK> <UNK> with enormous <UNK> capacity and the power to <UNK> thoughts into virtual reality after <UNK> capture the rest of the survivors <UNK> as none of them really existed except <UNK> the episode ends when the <UNK> learns that <UNK> evidence is in fact being <UNK> to the enterprise directly from <UNK> iv in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> orders an immediate halt to the <UNK> and we wonder what will happen next to be continued in a review of the <UNK> part ii
<START> the story is about the life of common people from <UNK> living their lives so i said it and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story the movie is fast like an mtv flick and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films so let's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next <UNK> <UNK> picture
<START> this was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen the first part of the movie though strange has a light and amusing quality to it the journey begins on such a peaceful note <UNK> and <UNK> the beauty of the hills of <UNK> but that is misleading beyond belief the obvious social problems <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie i can still hear bobby <UNK> in pain and i <UNK> at the thought <UNK> leg made me <UNK> yet while the movie was on the whole very disturbing and <UNK> it <UNK> some interesting questions when is it moral or right to take another <UNK> life what can morality drive us to do or not do in some cases and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself whatever conclusions one may draw from the film it is an achievement in its own right despite certain aspects that were <UNK> real and gruesome
<START> i like chris rock but i feel he is wasted in this film the idea of <UNK> heaven can wait is fine but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely when eddie murphy remade dr <UNK> and the nutty professor he re did them totally so they became murphy films vehicles not just tepid remakes that's why they were successful if chris had done the same this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his <UNK> routine so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he <UNK> was a truck driver or <UNK> so why does hollywood keep making junk like this because people go to see it because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place
<START> believe it or don't i have my very own dvd copy of this movie which i bought at <UNK> for a great big whole dollar i'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar <UNK> wasted br br pretty amazing set designs and costumes apparently much thought and effort went into their making the set designs are very mexican in <UNK> i liked them a lot and santa is impressive one of the more impressive <UNK> in <UNK> br br i'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience but somehow it comes across quite deranged in fact i'm left stunned at how deranged it is br br maybe it's the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an <UNK> <UNK> the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very very weird br br did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their <UNK> you didn't neither did i until i watched this movie one learns something new everyday br br is this movie actually worth watching now that's a <UNK> i can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way yet its unintentional <UNK> is what makes it worth watching you decide what you're going to do i <UNK> for myself it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing <UNK> ballet moves now that's just wrong
<START> probably one of the prime examples of following a suspenseful dramatic episode in this case the superb balance of terror with a lighter affair shore leave is the first true attempt on behalf of the star trek writers to produce a more entertaining piece of sci fi and while the formula isn't quite right yet in this entry the true triumph is trouble with <UNK> in season 2 the laughs come pretty fast as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the silliness br br <UNK> from the show's tradition the enterprise isn't on any proper mission in this episode instead kirk has found a perfect planet for his crew to spend some time off duty a well deserved break after three months of <UNK> work the earth like planet a budget related fact is very appealing but it only takes a few minutes before something weird happens dr mccoy starts having visions of a white rabbit that seems to come straight out of lewis <UNK> work soon other people begin experiencing similar things a woman meets a don juan like character <UNK> has a run in with a samurai and kirk faces a double encounter with the past in the shape of almost love and the guy who used to pick on him at the academy throw in a <UNK> real looking tiger and it's easy to see why kirk and spock are determined to figure out what's going on before anybody gets hurt br br the idea is a classic one <UNK> place turns out to be far from heavenly the <UNK> humorous take on the topic is rather successful weren't it for a dark turn of events that doesn't sit well with the rest of course everything works out fine again come the end and the <UNK> general <UNK> to show a funnier side of themselves most notably and ironically the otherwise hilarious william shatner and yet shore leave deserves recognition for being another good example of the writers trying new previously unseen things the definition of star <UNK> success br br 7 5 10
<START> this is one of the best military films ever made and it is great because of its focus on values it's a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor loyalty love and determination br br gooding and deniro are superb in the lead roles it's wonderful to see the master <UNK> racism <UNK> toward respect and love through carl <UNK> determination drive and yes sense of honor the title <UNK> the source of their bond i never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant carl <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> father mac brashear was in a way it's a <UNK> of the film in that it's <UNK> memory of his father that helps carry him through hard times br br i am <UNK> about what films i purchase this is one of those rare ones that i want on my shelf it will be seen many times in the future i'm sure
<START> sure the plot isn't <UNK> it seems the only great movies these days are amazingly shocking or high budget hyped in some way br br spin kick is a drama comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into <UNK> <UNK> do regardless of what you expect from this film you're guaranteed to feel moved by the work pain and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience though comedic at times many moments and characters are rendered beautifully there's the old guard character who takes things too seriously the <UNK> turned good guy who just wants a second chance at life the meek team substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life and many other well rounded characters with their own problems but most importantly their own their hopes and dreams while the plot and the goals of the movie are simple these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter personal struggles br br in short this film will leave you feeling fresh determined and satisfied
<START> i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie <UNK> around the lives of mary <UNK> and <UNK> characters sam and emma <UNK> they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately it's just not that easy for them to actually do i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed out big time and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now this movie is a real winner sincerely rick morris
<START> the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a <UNK> felix but they're under selling the film without knowing it this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce it's also damn funny from start to finish but it's the kind of comedy that <UNK> from realistic <UNK> and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its <UNK> is its strength besides <UNK> <UNK> face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile
<START> at first this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a <UNK> the first time i saw it it was like a bad dream a <UNK> bore but i gave it a second chance then another and another etc i finally got addicted to this film due to it's <UNK> slow pace wonderful natural sets <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> light and especially the musical score which is made of some 70's <UNK> rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor singer <UNK> derek <UNK> the <UNK> you should notice the song about <UNK> wood silver <UNK> and lady <UNK> in the air heard in the middle and near the end of the film there are some <UNK> scenes in the beginning <UNK> allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth <UNK> if that movie had been made by some <UNK> directors like bergman lars von <UNK> or jean luc <UNK> critics would have rolled on the floor raving about that movie as if it were a <UNK> masterpiece i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of <UNK> cinematic sh <UNK> t definitely not for the pretentious
<START> election is a chinese mob movie or <UNK> in this case every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader and at first it seems a toss up between big d tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or as i know him the other tony <UNK> and <UNK> simon <UNK> who was judge in full contact though once <UNK> wins big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever <UNK> he can to secure recognition as the new leader unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters this one is not an action movie it has its bloody moments when necessary as in <UNK> but it's basically just a really effective drama there are a lot of characters which is really hard to keep track of but i think that plays into the <UNK> of it all a bit a 100 year old <UNK> which is the symbol of power i mentioned before changes hands several times before things settle down and though it may appear that the film ends at the <UNK> or 70 minute mark there are still a couple big surprises waiting simon <UNK> was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture br br election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards winning for best actor tony <UNK> best picture best director johnny to who did heroic trio and best screenplay it also had nominations for cinematography editing film score which i loved and three more acting performances including <UNK>
<START> of course the story line for this movie isn't the best but the dances are wonderful this story line is different from other astaire rogers movies in that neither one is chasing the other the dancing of fred and ginger is what makes this movie
<START> directed by the duo <UNK> <UNK> battlefield baseball and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> machine is apparently a remake of <UNK> 1999 movie with the same name i doubt i'll ever get a chance to see the original so i'll just stick commenting on this one first of what is <UNK> machine a simple in <UNK> pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore it's not something you'll end up writing books about but it's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema br br <UNK> machine follows the well known plot boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date boy finally meets girl girl gets infected by a <UNK> alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg boy in turn does also <UNK> into said thing and goes on a quest to save his love will he succeed who gives a damn as long as there is carnage and death i'm satisfied br br the plot is simple relatively clichéd but it does it's job well enough setting the movie's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters there is a subplot focusing on how the <UNK> that infected the girl came into to their lives and yes it too luckily shows more violence i'm happy acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film it's not exactly painful for the ears but it's not exactly good either br br the movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore like i haven't mentioned that enough already are the cyborg designs done by <UNK> <UNK> who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known the <UNK> as they are called in <UNK> machine look stunningly detailed without the usage of cgi <UNK> designs are a breathtaking <UNK> of flesh and metal painfully awesome in their appearance able to transforms various parts of the body into cool <UNK> such as <UNK> rocket <UNK> blood firing <UNK> and so on and so on though you can easily recognize the <UNK> of the film <UNK> are a movie class br br <UNK> machine is <UNK> the iron man mixed up with alien all done in low budget and extra <UNK> mode it's an immensely entertaining film that <UNK> modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking
<START> full house came to me when i was about 9 i remember seeing re runs of america's funniest home videos with bob <UNK> and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house one day i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family it didn't seem too interesting at first but as i watched more and more ever night at 9 00 i would just be so into it br br this show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family sing <UNK> br br the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be it's still a great show and i would definitely recommend it to anyone br br 10 10
<START> it could have been a <UNK> fascinating look at the life of one of america's most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn't even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 the only redeeming quality is bruce <UNK> as the father but that's not nearly enough to save this stinker a 1 out of 10
<START> this movie's one of my favorites it's not really any good but it's great to laugh at the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted <UNK> <UNK> can we ask you a few questions sure we think you can help us with the answers any fighting is more or less <UNK> make sure to watch for <UNK> the <UNK> white guy who attacks the main characters he only has two lines but he's one of the best guys in the movie
<START> i love old burt reynolds movies they're funnier and better than every other movie combined they might as well have stopped making movies after <UNK> run 2 but i guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones man this movie's good burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a <UNK> a lot and the <UNK> <UNK> anderson is on hand looking extremely hot in an <UNK> way burt and <UNK> those were the days i used to have this magazine that had <UNK> anderson in it advertising for a <UNK> <UNK> i sure loved that <UNK> plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the <UNK> is upset at something <UNK> ace <UNK> r is doing and it shows one guy in the audience <UNK> over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night if you can find this movie rent it and then never watch another movie again because i tell you right now there's no point
<START> this movie was as homer simpson would have put it more boring than church maybe i don't understand it well enough and i thought it started out pretty well but after start of spoiler <UNK> <UNK> is sent to jail and maria starts working sleeping with her boss it just started to drag and i <UNK> to keep awake again maybe it <UNK> something but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place end of spoiler in the end i fail to see why others think it's so great as i found it extremely boring by the way i did not watch this movie by my own free will as i was required to see it for a film class
<START> i'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre but even by the standards of low low budget exploitation this one is really lame even on a nudity and gore level it's incredibly boring there is some of both but it's all sort of <UNK> before the home video revolution it might not even have been released <UNK> though it might have after all plan 9 from outer space played in theaters there is precisely one good and competently delivered line in the entire movie i assume they stole it from somewhere br br the acting is among the worst i have ever seen i mean even ed wood had a couple of competent actors and the rest tended to be <UNK> hammy which can be fun to watch anyway most of his actors could pretty much pass as <UNK> here those who don't read their lines like <UNK> store indians sound like they learned them <UNK> and this film does have one distinction it manages to be badly <UNK> for most of the movie then laughably <UNK> for the ending br br update i should have <UNK> out the actress playing the <UNK> as an exception she is by no means wooden not that she's good but she certainly isn't wooden br br even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few <UNK> <UNK> on their grotesque <UNK> but with this one there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about br br and you know the funniest thing they clearly expected to make a sequel br br it's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way i sat <UNK> through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it
<START> <UNK> is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasn't fantastic but the first 50 or so minutes were if you're a fan br br i personally believe the first 50 minutes are re watchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining br br it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert footage br br if you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if you're not a fan don't like michael jackson steer well clear br br 9 10
<START> rock star <UNK> was the best music tv series i have ever watched it had some of the greatest rock <UNK> roll songs ever written performed by 15 very talented singers performers it also had in my opinion the most heart felt feel good surprise endings in all of reality tv it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner over the 13 weeks of this <UNK> competition the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants after 30 some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show and the fact that <UNK> was and still is one of the greatest rock <UNK> roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series if you don't have the series recorded rock star <UNK> the dvd is a great alternative
<START> i first saw this movie 3 years ago and it was introduced by then disney chief <UNK> and the real jim morris br br about a month ago it came back on tv and this time i taped it since then i must've watched it at least three times br br this is a wonderful inspirational feel good movie that is intelligently written and <UNK> acted by everyone concerned it <UNK> going for every sentimental trick in the book as well as all of the other clichés br br it is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't <UNK> and have a whole slew of <UNK> issues and the <UNK> aren't portrayed as <UNK> driven <UNK> br br these are just normal people who have dreams like you and i br br in my opinion hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term gritty realism making movies where everyone <UNK> and has problems with <UNK> br br this movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream the people in big lake <UNK> seem so <UNK> that i want to move there br br as i said <UNK> the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality dennis quaid as usual never disappoints i've watched him from the late 70's and he is so underrated br br but this movie has excellent performances from everyone concerned and kudos to the writers br br a gem in the movie is near the end when jim is practicing in the <UNK> before the big game and his wife calls out to him from the stands he rushes over and reaches out to his family the look on the faces of the three other <UNK> sitting on the <UNK> in the <UNK> is priceless br br if you're looking for a change of pace then pick this movie up
<START> in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be <UNK> to do so it is amazing i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing <UNK> in both montana and <UNK> do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
<START> when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film usually when you have these types of movies there's generally one sasquatch but in this one there is like what 7 or 10 of them acting was good plot was ok i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims very good camera work i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little this movie was way better than sasquatch the sci fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain <UNK> was not good the one i'm reviewing is ok but the movie sasquatch was not but i'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track this movie is good for a rainy <UNK> afternoon but for any other occasions no
<START> this is the story of a young woman <UNK> and then dumped by her older married lover after she gets pregnant she <UNK> herself against him and his entire family through black magic <UNK> <UNK> she doesn't do herself but has someone else do for her good production values for a <UNK> horror flick but the bland script never <UNK> suspense the director approaches the material entirely <UNK> and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds at one point a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the <UNK> dead and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun bad writing  you're <UNK> in it br br some <UNK> gore effects including a really tasteless late term <UNK> corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live <UNK> burst out of his stomach only recommended for genre <UNK> who simply have to see every horror film produced in asia in the last 15 years
<START> this movie is the worst <UNK> seen nicole kidman really <UNK> me this movie has nothing i would not watch it again even if it were the last movie on earth great actors but bad script
<START> i tried watching this abomination of the cinema when i was five years old i have never been the same since filled to the <UNK> with drug induced images that <UNK> of the common <UNK> of your average asylum resident this movie despite its colorful appearance is not for humans especially not children br br it starts out <UNK> enough with a poor boy who ruins his <UNK> drum by wait for it putting his head through it yes putting his head through it but fear not my friends he is quickly <UNK> by his <UNK> <UNK> which is weird enough i'll grant you but still acceptable br br then the movie <UNK> into a combination of wizard of oz and where the wild things are but loses all the warm and fuzzy aspects of either of these two books br br so this seven foot yellow relative of barney befriends this poor boy and <UNK> him even deeper into despair br br and to add the pleasant array of horrific themes a <UNK> boat <UNK> a friend of the <UNK> crew of <UNK> grandfather <UNK> and <UNK> up dragons is added to the mix of mayhem br br the most <UNK> image in the midst of this chaos is the villain <UNK> dubbed <UNK> of course she has problems of her own what with an obvious plastic mask <UNK> her facial expressions to having to deal with a <UNK> whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most <UNK> moments as a result of this one of her favorite <UNK> was nose diving into the body of water that separated the land of <UNK> from her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i don't know where i would have preferred to live br br in summary this movie is terrifying br br if you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as the exorcist then this one is for you enjoy
<START> yeah i remember this one many years since i actually watched it the story was entirely surreal but nonetheless great what anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at it's the same with first kid which follows a similar pattern certain movies like this one here just aim at plain and comical nonsense such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a <UNK> reviewer of course these movies lack quality lack a sophisticated storyline very often lack first class acting but if they do <UNK> their primary premise that's okay i don't have this movie here on my list of all time favorites but i still thought it was funny had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story brian <UNK> is a smart actor anyway
<START> as if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of <UNK> <UNK> 1973 which i had watched earlier this year the <UNK> value name <UNK> in this time is telly <UNK> who <UNK> enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather <UNK> <UNK> to his flowers and wearing a <UNK> in the style of french <UNK> apart from not looking <UNK> <UNK> he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar <UNK> antonio <UNK> then makes for an unlikely gangster apart from being a <UNK> leading man his relationship with <UNK> which becomes <UNK> at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes <UNK> involved with the <UNK> spirited teenage niece besides for a gangster flick there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by <UNK> de <UNK> is <UNK> but nothing else incidentally the bargain basement dvd i rented starts off <UNK> through the credits so that none of the cast members or even the film's title is ever listed
<START> i have not seen this movie at least not in its entirety i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me <UNK> to see it all one sequence remains in my memory to this day a very convincing looking <UNK> is <UNK> the dark side of the moon the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him the moon flashes into <UNK> and for a few seconds there it is parallel lines <UNK> could it be then the light fades and the brief <UNK> of what has gone and it is time for the <UNK> to return to earth wonderful i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie
<START> if mr <UNK> had rated this i'd be tempted just to copy his review and <UNK> it here but as he hasn't i'll have to give it a go myself br br the only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that malcolm <UNK> acting is excellent however not even he can save this film from disaster the director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a <UNK> of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity reminiscent of bad <UNK> movies even worse both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was br br it's not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the <UNK> corporation who put together a crew of <UNK> people to carry a dangerous <UNK> on an old <UNK> slave ship to <UNK> this <UNK> computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and <UNK> into one of the crew via <UNK> 12 or something the company should have been called the <UNK> corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name br br i honestly can't find one scene that i could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie i only watched it to the end as i had a touch of the bird <UNK> and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me malcolm <UNK> in particular i won't hold this against him as he's a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a <UNK> br br so unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you're male and you're doctor isn't doing <UNK> <UNK> this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide <UNK> unless of course if you're really community minded buy a copy to support malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster
<START> i actually had hopes for this movie since i've seen <UNK> in a few other things and think she has some talent alas this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay completely <UNK> characters without a shred of <UNK> and no plot whatsoever is it a road buddy comedy thriller romance drama the filmmakers don't have a clue and neither do we
<START> terry <UNK> and david <UNK> teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the <UNK> people's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  i especially love the idea one can't change the past it's a nice <UNK> to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise  <UNK> <UNK> and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam <UNK> his ideas with unique <UNK> perfection and originality br br the story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information he'll collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travelling technology isn't perfect he ends up being sent towards different other <UNK> and <UNK> things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right <UNK> end of the millennium paranoia <UNK> weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas br br i watched this movie once around 10 years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days after <UNK> for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important i've re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it's better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes he's in playing jeffrey <UNK>  almost a <UNK> to his tyler <UNK> character in fight club  a rich kid with some <UNK> non <UNK> ideas who's also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the <UNK> are the best in the movie <UNK> eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a <UNK> logic only he understands <UNK> oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce <UNK> performance his i didn't remember very well but it's beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character <UNK> tried to <UNK> some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he <UNK> his own teeth reveals how far his <UNK> has gone <UNK> ironically cole didn't start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he can't <UNK> past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when <UNK> shrink dr kathryn <UNK> finds <UNK> proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed although perhaps a bit <UNK> for <UNK> sake but i enjoyed watching cole and <UNK> falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport <UNK> all the pieces together which will blow many minds away br br there are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of <UNK> or fight club and a more intimate ending where <UNK> is <UNK> next to cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who's witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine <UNK> is very good playing dr <UNK> she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of <UNK> with the idea the past can't be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of <UNK> in that sense the way jake <UNK> <UNK> everything up the more he tries to help <UNK> character shares that <UNK> the more she tries to help cole  first dealing with his <UNK> then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy br br the twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling <UNK> mission hasn't been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it's not supposed to be art although it's more artists than many artistic movies it's an <UNK> movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece
<START> wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably can't even play the <UNK> number 2 on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really don't hate it that bad i'd give it like a 4 out of 10 but what <UNK> me is how everyone says they have such great talent and <UNK> is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore <UNK> with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didn't get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon
<START> i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place however the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better all in all this is a great and valuable film slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream it's a thrilling and interesting movie experience
<START> i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed reese <UNK> is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at a young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason i didn't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer <UNK> character is quite underdeveloped i think it is understandable that dani reese w the younger would be <UNK> and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because she's a few years older hasn't the end rather <UNK> the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets <UNK> warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit well it works it depends what you want if you want the girls' happy story of young love that it seems like you're going to get you're in for a surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination i liked the character of court though i can see what girls watching this might be watching and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn't and get killed br br 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason i found jason london on a <UNK> funny
<START> a brilliant russian <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> system for winning at contract bridge which makes him and his beautiful wife the grand slam <UNK> of america br br what could have been just another silly soap opera is <UNK> by fine production values excellent acting to the status of a very enjoyable little comedy a few unexpected touches are thrown in to keep the viewer's attention engaged the way in which the principle cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards the introduction of a zany <UNK> into the plot for no other reason than to enjoy a bit of <UNK> and the way in which a wide variety of different kinds of americans are shown to be <UNK> by listening to the broadcast of the <UNK> game br br paul lukas loretta young do very well as the bridge <UNK> lukas suave sophisticated and miss young <UNK> loving and beautiful even if the script keeps her <UNK> on a cigarette a bit too much they are fun to watch even when their behavior is not always the most believable or compelling br br frank <UNK> gives another good performance as a relentlessly cheerful ghost writer who <UNK> miss young the delightful glenda farrell <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> persona in a small role as <UNK> <UNK> gal pal <UNK> <UNK> handles the fast talking dialogue as a <UNK> radio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful as a <UNK> bridge expert br br movie <UNK> will recognize <UNK> robinson as a <UNK> nightclub <UNK> emma <UNK> as a <UNK> sister reporter paul <UNK> as the owner of the russian nightclub charles lane as a russian <UNK> and jimmy <UNK> as a <UNK> at the final bridge game all uncredited br br the film takes advantage of the <UNK> for contract bridge which had swept across the country since its development in the <UNK> it expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the <UNK> of the game and makes no attempt to explain anything to the <UNK>
<START> what a pleasant surprise a disney <UNK> direct to video sequel that's actually good the lion king 1 1 2 is a comedy affair that involves everyone's favorite <UNK> and <UNK> timon and pumbaa it starts out with them watching the original movie and making comments until timon complains that we're not here yet after fighting over the remote timon and pumbaa decide to tell the audience their story they start the new movie and the laughs begin br br to be honest i was losing hope in disney most of their direct to video fare has been <UNK> awful with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original 1 1 2 decides to try something different it tells the original story from a new point of view okay it adds some stuff like where timon came from and how he and pumbaa met but it's an interesting concept nathan lane and ernie <UNK> perfectly <UNK> the bond and friendship that made us love them in the first movie there's also some neat movie parodies including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'the good the bad and the <UNK> and <UNK> hand luke and the script is filled with funny memorable lines br br added to the cast are julie <UNK> the simpsons as <UNK> worry <UNK> mom and jerry stiller as <UNK> slightly crazy uncle max matthew <UNK> shows up as <UNK> and his teen scene reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> everyone does well especially robert <UNK> is that how you spell it as <UNK> who exudes more and more <UNK> speak in this movie timon comments on this several times br br 'the lion king 1 1 <UNK> is a perfect alternate choice for those of you getting tired of the <UNK> of animation 10 10
<START> vincent <UNK> plays the part of paul an ex con assigned to an office job where he meets carla a secretary who is <UNK> <UNK> when she has her hearing aids in <UNK> <UNK> when not played by <UNK> <UNK> together they help each other to develop as people br br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes paul appears uneasy in the office environment is it that he's just not cut out for work this belief is <UNK> when he gets a job in a bar and shines br br the film has a certain <UNK> which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even if we think it is harmless or justified br br finally it is a film full of great <UNK> both touching and humorous one is when carla is <UNK> and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to <UNK> it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
<START> i had high hopes for <UNK> and i am so <UNK> disappointed the film was directed so badly it made my stomach <UNK> the pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film well apart from a nice fight scene between <UNK> pitt and hector <UNK> the rest was shallow br br and why oh why does hollywood always insist on <UNK> stories to fit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> didn't die in <UNK> the war lasted 10 years and <UNK> was killed by paris outside the walls of <UNK> with an arrow to the <UNK> it <UNK> me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap br br and don't even start me on the <UNK> of chemistry between helen and paris she was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other no sparks no emotion no hope br br i have to say in the films <UNK> brad pitt eric <UNK> and peter <UNK> <UNK> acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie br br can anybody tell me where the <UNK> million budget went maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral <UNK> where did they get all those trees br br i am so disappointed it hurts
<START> <UNK> <UNK> a weak peter fonda who also directed an aging <UNK> wins young teen <UNK> <UNK> pretty but not talented brooke <UNK> in a poker game together the unlikely pair of course <UNK> on a search for indian gold in the grand canyon br br that's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it it just isn't there the acting is very weak too which was quite a surprise given the fact that peter fonda was in the lead br br if you're looking for something interesting in this film take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young brooke <UNK> her character however is so irritating especially at the beginning and dumb that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing too bad but given the story i doubt anything more could be made of this i wonder why peter fonda directed and starred in this film he must have even talked his father henry fonda into a useless cameo in this ridiculous mess unfortunately this was their only film together couldn't henry be in easy rider for example 3 10
<START> i cannot get past the message of this movie it's laid out much too clearly to ignore and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it's about i haven't read the novel but <UNK> film opens with a scene at a cia front organization in new york which is broken into by two professional <UNK> headed by max von <UNK> who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we've come to know and understand the staff include an elderly female <UNK> a <UNK> elderly <UNK> guy who's <UNK> falls off when he is machine <UNK> is that a joke and last the beautiful tina <UNK> who looks up from the <UNK> realizes she is about to be murdered and says <UNK> brave i won't scream von <UNK> replies <UNK> i know these murders are completely unexpected savage <UNK> by anything that we are aware of and graphic it is a brutal scene br br there is absolutely no way in which von <UNK> and his henchman can be redeemed and yet that is exactly what <UNK> tries to do towards the end br br after having killed these innocent good guys von <UNK> switches sides because the other side is willing to pay him and <UNK> the evil mastermind behind a complicated <UNK> cia plot the script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable sensitive human being it is better to live in europe things are not so rushed or whatever i swear i'm not making this up <UNK> wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked <UNK> that's the message you should write it down in case you forget just exactly what kind of psychiatric <UNK> do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values not to mention common sense upside down like that i understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the united states even hate it and who see <UNK> just about everywhere providing a <UNK> jerk explanation for otherwise <UNK> events i know that people who think this way exist because i number some of them among my closer friends nevertheless at some point this dislike this hatred if it <UNK> in intensity must pass beyond politics or <UNK> and into the realm of the psychiatric i don't for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official i don't care how suave and <UNK> the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the <UNK> on the <UNK> whoever is <UNK> that message needs either <UNK> or <UNK> br br i'd like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message but i can't it's quite well done in some ways that's worse because it makes the film less <UNK> even new york city looks <UNK> on the screen and it's been a long time since i've thought of new york as <UNK> robert redford does an admirable job of <UNK> his character's initial shock and confusion but then turns into a <UNK> semi genius and man he looks just fine his wardrobe is just right even his <UNK> glasses are becoming and his <UNK> it's not everyone who can make a navy <UNK> jacket look glamorous he seems extremely handsome too the <UNK> i want to look like that i want to wear a <UNK> shirt and a tie with such <UNK> faye <UNK> is alright in her role but it's not too believable a role would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at <UNK> even if he did look like redford would anyone be emotionally wounded if when this <UNK> relationship is about to end redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened cliff robertson is surprisingly good he does one or two extremely good double takes the <UNK> is superb the fight between him and redford in a crowded apartment is <UNK> choreographed and for once we really don't know for sure how it will turn out because redford a book reader after all seems <UNK> against the <UNK> cunning of this hired assassin this is one of john <UNK> final roles a shame he's a <UNK> on screen and what an end to his life a friend finds him lost wandering the streets of new york in a neighborhood he'd been familiar with for most of his life br br yes the movie is very well executed but i can't ignore that vicious paranoid message i have the same problem with <UNK> <UNK> triumph of the will or her olympic documentary in which the <UNK> is watching a foot race in which jesse <UNK> is pulling into the lead and says <UNK> this <UNK> is dangerous
<START> farrah fawcett has spent the better part of her post <UNK> career <UNK> us with an occasional noteworthy acting performance <UNK> in between her playboy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but when it comes down to it there's no denying that this girl can act far from a story of epic proportions this well done tv movie is gentle quiet and occasionally moving fawcett plays the <UNK> black sheep daughter come home only to find that she missed the last days of her mom's life as well as the funeral much to the <UNK> of her more stable and presumably more sensible sister brad johnson plays the love interest and a story unfolds with all the typical elements of <UNK> drama but then there's always that <UNK> farrah to watch and she does indeed remain <UNK> watchable and yes i admit it i did have that farrah poster on my wall way back when <UNK> hope gets three and a half stars out of five on the <UNK> <UNK> would be proud
<START> a very early oliver stone associate produced film and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman co <UNK> and president of the world's only real independent film studio troma creator of the toxic <UNK> and at the <UNK> <UNK> fantastic <UNK> lifetime achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years having raised the money for this film on his own lloyd wrote this script together with theodore <UNK> in 1970 and in <UNK> regrets having listened to advice to have <UNK> else direct the film instead of doing it himself but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore indeed it would have been interesting to see <UNK> version of his own script as one of the world's most original daring experimental and non <UNK> directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has but as it is we have the <UNK> directed film and weather it is due to the strong script or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own sugar <UNK> is a very intelligent highly suspenseful and well crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives the <UNK> budget the small studio this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now michael <UNK> formed troma had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive indeed does not have a low budget look at all the story revolves around lesbian <UNK> stone played by enigmatic mary <UNK> and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i won't reveal not to spoil a delightful story this leads to a succession of plot twists mind games and personality <UNK> that is loosely inspired by hitchcock's vertigo and at least as inventive the atmosphere is a lot <UNK> though and some comparisons to nicholas <UNK> and donald <UNK> performance come to mind in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end which along with a <UNK> <UNK> sub plot with a nod to <UNK> earlier and unfortunately <UNK> big <UNK> what's the fuss makes for a very exciting one and a half hour certainly one of the best films in <UNK> library and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their <UNK> is one of bad taste the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman <UNK> with <UNK> and the other leading lady <UNK> <UNK> later seen in george romero's the <UNK> thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself highly recommended
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have had a profound influence on my life as a christian and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life words can hardly express my disappointment this movie was disjointed it gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great <UNK> except a brief passing reference to the cost of <UNK> by a colleague at the beginning of the movie instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany apparently to show his human side ok i'm ready for the dramatic part the part where he stands up for his faith instead of <UNK> that we get a very badly acted romance with a 17 year old <UNK> whether or not that actually took place it should not have been a major portion of the movie now still waiting for the dramatic part or some narration explaining what his <UNK> were all about or something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man drum roll waiting waiting <UNK> <UNK> this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow with some background even some voice overs or flashbacks to him preaching from his works some narrative about who he was and where he had been but no this is what we got hardly fitting for a hero of the faith
<START> holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the <UNK> thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho it's a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the <UNK> and you can tell there's no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift <UNK> then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to <UNK> beyond the <UNK> eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of <UNK> only without kevin <UNK> there to save the day worst movie ever
<START> an absolutely brilliant film <UNK> <UNK> the master of puppet animation confronts <UNK> in this his final film it would be banned by the communist <UNK> government at the time despite taking the country's highest animation award br br in this dark and entertaining short film an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose all of a sudden he here's a knock at the door and in comes this giant <UNK> hand that tries to force the artist to make <UNK> in it's <UNK> the artist <UNK> as best he can but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts by the hand to force him to <UNK> he becomes <UNK> an intellectual zombie at this point the hand <UNK> strings to the artist puts him in a cage and uses him to make hand <UNK> all the while <UNK> the <UNK> work and <UNK> him with <UNK> and <UNK> br br the <UNK> inner lust to be able to express himself <UNK> is what helps him <UNK> over his <UNK> and <UNK> him escape his prison whether it be literal or in his mind and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the <UNK> hand he <UNK> himself in thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high hoping it is out of the reach of the hand and it ends up falling on his head killing him the artist is <UNK> destroyed by his own creation all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the <UNK> strings once dead the hand paints the artist as a great person a national hero unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered br br <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> society and their lack of right for free expression is dark <UNK> and an amazingly animated it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire and would perhaps even listen to that was obviously not acceptable an amazing example of an artists civil <UNK> and the impact it can have and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world from the us to the middle east a must see and definite 10 out of 10 talk about going out with a bang
<START> this is a feel good film about one person's dreams and the drive or push to realize them it is a beautiful and inspirational film why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out especially the good ones dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career with excellent supporting cast including brian cox as the <UNK> old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son's achievements go by without his support it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film if i have one complaint with this film it is this don't ever let <UNK> <UNK> sign the national <UNK> again br br seriously this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like field of dreams and the natural it rates two thumbs up and a big well done
<START> penn takes the time to develop his characters and we almost care about them however there are some real problems with the story here we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior and the time line is screwed up supposedly set in 1963 the music is late 60s early 70s the references and dialogue is 70s 80s the potential for a powerful climax presents itself and penn allows it to slip away but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch but not great
<START> this show started out with great mystery episodes i think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes after that the show started playing short episodes with shaggy scooby doo and <UNK> doo br br i think <UNK> <UNK> productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes some of the voice actors became <UNK> after 15 or 16 episodes frank <UNK> who played fred became <UNK> i think the voice of <UNK> changes after first 12 episodes because the first voice actress who played <UNK> was <UNK> br br and the network ordered the <UNK> <UNK> studio to make more shorts with shaggy scooby doo and <UNK> doo because the ratings were high so they had to make more shorts i wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes still it is a good show
<START> ah bait how do i hate <UNK> let me count the ways 1 you try to be funny but are corny and <UNK> every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter instead i want to <UNK> 2 you try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like bill gates and is about as scary as well bill gates just try to imagine bill gates trying to <UNK> somebody with a gun doesn't work does it a lawyer maybe but not a gun doesn't fit as for jamie foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to <UNK> 3 you try to be action packed but instead are dull and dragging too many times and when the action <UNK> up the <UNK> for the camera must have been lost for the scenes <UNK> more than those in the blair witch project and i find myself <UNK> and once again i want to <UNK> 4 you try to be a good movie but you failed you failed you failed i would rather walk <UNK> across the <UNK> with a pack full of <UNK> jerky and no water no <UNK> and only meryl streep for company this hell would be <UNK> than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait <UNK> their way through an <UNK> written story with bill gates for a bad guy and let's not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie <UNK> character has just driven off a cliff but somehow manages to escape just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i'll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again
<START> monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american <UNK> factory are there any else in hollywood <UNK> the waters of the small <UNK> town of <UNK> somehow creating a <UNK> like beast with a <UNK> for <UNK> and loose women james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to <UNK> by his foul mouthed boss barnes who himself can't keep his hands off of his <UNK> rear to get to the bottom pun intended of the story while in <UNK> bill must <UNK> with an annoying reporter who apparently <UNK> all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns there is also a radical named <UNK> that wishes to <UNK> the factory for <UNK> the water which by the way also supplies the town with jobs for the locals but why let cold hearted <UNK> get in the way of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pete the factory boss is <UNK> aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex girlfriend on the beach tells her that he is seeing the <UNK> daughter <UNK> and it's over between them then she is promptly eaten that night a little side action without the evidence my hat is off to you sir john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to <UNK> <UNK> you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face might as well filmed him running to the local <UNK> exchange to see if his check didn't <UNK> br br supposedly based on a true story so much so they say it twice in the opening credits this film is awful on all <UNK> filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth <UNK> put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters even putting his daughter <UNK> in top billing with mitchum and carradine the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone <UNK> <UNK> over the camera before filming this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night the monster itself is laughable as it <UNK> its ugly <UNK> head for the <UNK> ending james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that <UNK> in the acting industry needs to be <UNK> utterly unwatchable dreck shame on you john carradine
<START> <UNK> is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time if you like to see <UNK> dancing in silver screen it's better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos <UNK> knows how to shoot dancing from old experience and time to time it's look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big
<START> i caught this a few months ago on family channel and having some memories of the tv show from my youth decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter i should have got some psychedelic <UNK> to go along with it 'cause this is just bizarre not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective <UNK> it seems to have been produced as <UNK> good acid trip talking <UNK> british children far too old for this kind of crap in the words of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> what was i on if you're a huge fan of the whole sid and marty <UNK> <UNK> go for it otherwise unless you're willing to get <UNK> before watching stay far far far away
<START> this isn't art it's inner urban politically correct propaganda <UNK> political <UNK> is beyond unforgivable it doesn't see people as individuals but rather as members of categories br br this is the most <UNK> offensive australian movie i can recall ever and it's up against some pretty stiff competition a message movie every tired theme beloved of the trendy left is there <UNK> are victims white men are violent or <UNK> white women aren't that bad particularly if they are lesbians but they're most likely of a <UNK> nature br br four men who go away fishing find the body of a murdered woman <UNK> naturally and leave her in the river for several days while they catch <UNK> it's a strange decision taken with almost no discussion as if the men are animals the one man who briefly <UNK> is the <UNK> we know this because he's living with a <UNK> woman he likes to hold his baby a lot and eventually moves to a more <UNK> <UNK> location away from all these <UNK> bush <UNK> br br this is a film made by those trendy <UNK> who live in fear of the australian landscape and those evil <UNK> who <UNK> within it's ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt the film is shot through with long distance views of the bush backed by foreboding mysterious music it's made very clear by the end that <UNK> people are the only ones at home in this landscape it concludes with an excruciatingly implausible scene of black white <UNK> br br in <UNK> country life is reduced to little more than a backdrop for a story that by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the values of <UNK> <UNK> urban <UNK> over those of other <UNK> br br this film was not made by people with real jobs but <UNK> by the <UNK> film <UNK> corporation it's a product of the artsy set that soulless void populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish government funding <UNK> these <UNK> offensive projects which are as detached from real life as possible as opposed to actually making popular films people want to see it doesn't matter if the film is a stinker they still get paid br br spare yourself from wasting time avoid it like the plague more jaded social commentary than actual entertainment this film deserves to pan
<START> this is an extremely powerful based on a true story film that can be <UNK> to watch i say that because how brutal a <UNK> press can be to people in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby br br meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam <UNK> was just as good let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts br br without giving anything away all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally
<START> the war between the states was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of america a war that <UNK> brother against brother and family against family and left <UNK> that even today have not yet <UNK> and in all <UNK> never will and as in any story about any war beyond any historical significance it is the personal <UNK> behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional <UNK> that makes it involving it is the human element that <UNK> the context necessary to give it perspective which is what director ang lee provides in ride with the devil ' a civil war drama in which he focuses on the personal <UNK> within the <UNK> depiction of the war itself and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the <UNK> chapters of the war the infamous raid on lawrence kansas by <UNK> and his <UNK> which he succeeds in presenting quite <UNK> from the <UNK> point of view br br in <UNK> the union influence <UNK> in the state of kansas and even across the border in <UNK> <UNK> those with <UNK> <UNK> are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the <UNK> <UNK> especially without the aid of what could be considered any <UNK> <UNK> troops and when things begin to really heat up around their own town jack bull <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jake <UNK> <UNK> maguire form a band of their own and join in the <UNK> doing damage to the union cause wherever it is <UNK> jack bull and jake do not like the war and do not like killing but they are standing up for what they believe to be right br br there are others however even among their own men like the young pitt <UNK> jonathan rhys meyers who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality <UNK> in many instances against innocent victims and so for jack bull and jake as well as many just like them it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral <UNK> will be sorely tested a time during which their souls will be <UNK> in blood and they will have to ride with the very devil himself against seemingly <UNK> odds br br as with all of his films director ang lee approaches his story through an <UNK> yet subtle examination of the traditions cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting and in so doing lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers perhaps a deeper grasp of the motivations that <UNK> his characters and the drama in which they are engaged whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters eat drink man <UNK> the effects of class distinction sense and <UNK> the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies <UNK> tiger hidden <UNK> or the moral <UNK> <UNK> by a lack of all of the above the ice <UNK> lee <UNK> his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level this film is no exception and as he does with all his films lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography in this film by <UNK> <UNK> who also did the ice <UNK> brilliantly which under his <UNK> is nothing less than visual poetry it's that special lee touch and it adds a <UNK> <UNK> sense to whatever story he is telling which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable br br as jake <UNK> maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that <UNK> so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops and his character along with it most importantly maguire convincingly and <UNK> responds to the events that unfold around him which adds to the credibility of the overall film and <UNK> the realism of the presentation his stoic acceptance of death and the news of those <UNK> in the various <UNK> and battles the moral <UNK> to which those he encounters <UNK> even in such troubled times the betrayal which because of the nature of the conflict is almost <UNK> and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions <UNK> <UNK> it is all of this that maguire achieves through his performance and it is no small accomplishment it is however the kind of studied understated performance that is often taken for granted which is unfortunate work like this is worthy of acclaim and should be recognized br br <UNK> <UNK> is effective as well as jack bull and jewel in her motion picture debut turns in an engaging performance as sue lee shelley it is jeffrey wright however who stands out in a notable supporting role as daniel holt as well as jonathan rhys meyers who brings a chilling christopher walken like menace to his role of pitt also in what amounts to a cameo role one scene mark <UNK> leaves an <UNK> impression with very little screen time br br the supporting cast includes james <UNK> black john simon baker george clyde tom <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> brown john <UNK> <UNK> john judd otto <UNK> and kathleen <UNK> mrs <UNK> the civil war will forever be an open wound upon the nation but hopefully as time goes on it will be through the objective <UNK> of filmmakers like ang lee and films like ride with the <UNK> that will ultimately help to close the <UNK> and promote healing in light of more recent events it is something that is sorely needed worldwide film is a powerful medium it can be educational as well as entertaining and perhaps in the future more filmmakers like ang lee will embrace and promote a sense of <UNK> through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> <UNK> palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man <UNK> drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug <UNK> i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false <UNK> of drug <UNK> i left the theatre and had my money <UNK> because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug <UNK> forget this
<START> this was a gem amazing acting from the leads liam cunningham <UNK> brady and all the supporting cast the movie raises a subject not only <UNK> to ireland and irish history but to many <UNK> around the world and many marriage <UNK> within those <UNK> with intensity and sincerity the movie shows how the religious <UNK> and traditions drove a <UNK> on a loving and passionate family the title love divided couldn't capture it any better even though it was a true story and happening in ireland of the <UNK> seeing how the life of the whole village <UNK> and <UNK> are starting reminded me of russian history the <UNK> and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and unfortunately it's deeply hidden inside the human nature just like in the movie the liam <UNK> character says the hatred had always been there under the surface it was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story also the character of a catholic priest and what happened to him in the end of the story was quite meaningful the story however gives hope that love of two people can <UNK> everything and love makes us better stronger liam <UNK> character goes through the whole transformation in the course of the story becoming a man he always wanted to be again acting is a top notch story is fast paced irish countryside is as beautiful as ever highly recommended
<START> i liked this show i think it was nothing with wrong with it only that <UNK> don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck some people only think this show is bad because of that the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x men the <UNK> <UNK> and iron man to bad <UNK> never appear but i kinda like it best <UNK> show ever my favorite episodes are 1 turning point 2 spider wars 3 the <UNK> 4 the alien costume 5 mutant agenda br br but there are some episodes that was really really bad like rocket <UNK> and the spot which was embarrassing to watch and i don't like <UNK> and <UNK> man first of <UNK> suck <UNK> instead of blood and i don't like vampires and it <UNK> me that he was almost the main villain in season 2 of course i have to mentioned <UNK> man he was terrible i rather see <UNK> his last appearance was so terrible and i don't like <UNK> as the man spider br br but i guess everything than this was bad
<START> ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about 30 minutes into the movie we'd <UNK> a lot of <UNK> what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with <UNK> and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we <UNK> for the latter br br i liked but i'm a <UNK> a lot but <UNK> kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer d e b s better than chocolate <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> memory and fire br br <UNK>
<START> i loved this film i first saw it when i was 20 which was only four years ago and i enjoyed it so much i brought my own copy the next day the comedy is well played by all involved i always have to <UNK> and <UNK> the scene where mr <UNK> explains why he found water at 6 <UNK> in one area and <UNK> feet in another area also look for jason <UNK> father who plays mr <UNK> talent ran in that family
<START> i am right now in front of the tv watching <UNK> it is changing it id <UNK> or better <UNK> it begin with a <UNK> wedding of the two protagonists where their love story is reported after that everything change a child was born and all the rest usually happen in a couple it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple and <UNK> is the center of this movie it doesn't want to show us something particular there is nothing new it is just a normal love story the story of a couple and being normal it become different from the rest it is also a flashing movie everything is short every scene is long just some seconds it is a reported story many things are known because friends and parents talk about that and their opinion is central the opinions create the story and destroy it it is a simple story of a couple as i said but it is not boring it just show a couple should be everything known it is but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen so don't forget to watch the end
<START> br br charlie <UNK> has made weird <UNK> angst popular but this canadian gem makes it hilarious br br like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let's set the scene two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood they can't cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to but that is where even more problems begin br br i loved this film it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of nothing out there br br don't miss this br br
<START> frankly this movie has gone over the heads of most of its <UNK> br br the opposite of <UNK> being lost is salvation being saved and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts the movie also explores the love and <UNK> that attend the father son relationship it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently <UNK> themes br br the premise is that the fathers in the move hit man michael sullivan tom hanks and his crime boss john rooney paul newman love their sons and will do anything to protect them but <UNK> son connor is even more evil than the rest he kills one of <UNK> loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father when connor learns that <UNK> son michael witnessed it he <UNK> kills <UNK> other son and <UNK> wife in an attempt to silence witnesses br br sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price even at the terribly high price of <UNK> rooney who in one scene <UNK> the day connor was born refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan and hires a contract killer named maguire jude law to kill sullivan and his son so rooney joins his son connor on the road to <UNK> br br for the rest of the movie accompanied by his surviving son young michael sullivan <UNK> connor rooney down the road to <UNK> and maguire <UNK> sullivan when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family rooney says michael there are only murderers in this room and there's only one guarantee none of us will see heaven as the movie ends somewhat predictably one character is saved and one character <UNK> br br i'm not a big tom hanks fan but he does step out of character to play hit man sullivan convincingly giving a subtle and <UNK> performance newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney showing a hard edge in his face and manner his eyes haunted by <UNK> <UNK> jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way tyler <UNK> plays young michael naturally and without <UNK> br br the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness <UNK> the themes of salvation and <UNK> the camera drew from a palette of <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> to the younger sons and that <UNK> rural <UNK> thomas <UNK> lush <UNK> and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in <UNK> like <UNK> the sets were authentic mid western urban <UNK> <UNK> the homes <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> br br the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes distinctive acting and <UNK> music and cinematography the only negative was a slight anti gun message slipped into the screenplay y the movie's only nod to political correctness br br i give this movie <UNK> out of 10 in time it will be acknowledged as a great film
<START> this film plays really well with an audience especially once the chase begins plus <UNK> howard with his sensible smart charms and jean simmons with her innocent demeanor and <UNK> eyes are terrific together br br the film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it <UNK> into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in <UNK> the mind of the jean simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household plus it helps bring out the real killer who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job the killer rightly believed that once the simmons character was arrested she would be put away and it is true that her lack of control in the household as well as evidence pointing her way there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge the chase that ensues helps bring out the truth br br this is an entertaining film seek it out if you can find it
<START> tom hanks has been in such hit movies as forrest <UNK> saving private ryan and the green mile for the most part his roles have been good guys that we cheer for in road to <UNK> his character michael <UNK> a little bit different br br in sam <UNK> film road to <UNK> based on the graphic novel by max allan collins he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the great depression in chicago what is different about this little road trip is that sullivan is a hit man who is now being hunted by his former partner his boss or ex boss john rooney paul newman loves him almost more than his own son <UNK> partner connor daniel craig br br after a job done the wrong way because of connor the only witness to his mistake are sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there so connor tries to take out sullivan and his family but only gets the wife and other son peter sullivan <UNK> the hit and rushes home to find michael jr sitting at the table just sitting with his wife and child dead sullivan takes to the road to find answers br br the story follows the two as sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid and for michael who feels like he is to blame for all this he feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother tyler <UNK> does a terrific job as michael jr he brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile his loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town leaving nothing behind him br br <UNK> previous hit film was american beauty which received five oscars including best picture and best director this film didn't do nearly as well at the oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music sound and a best actor in a supporting role for paul newman this picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the <UNK> and into the legend of mike sullivan husband hit man and devoted father this movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come
<START> hey guys br br i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area i am australian could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages it was my favourite movie <UNK> i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager it is a great movie for the whole family my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on dvd br br sally
<START> good show br br the basic background is that humanity is at a <UNK> there is a set of moral <UNK> that are being faced mankind has made a number of technological <UNK> but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys there is moral <UNK> in a virtual world there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention i predict based on the bsg background that there will be an issue with <UNK> and slavery in addition to this there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves br br this show is not bsg at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making there are not a lot of shoot em up or space based special effects either at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far br br what it does have are very good stories characters and themes it also has good performances from the actors they can make a culture which is similar to modern day society but alien at the same time be completely believable like bsg this show is about humanity our strengths weaknesses potential and flaws it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has <UNK> <UNK> cars and chicken but those things are really more to create a semi familiar background than anything else anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point whether you are from a mafia style culture or an <UNK> and high tech culture humans and human nature aren't that different 150 000 years ago in a high tech past than what we see in the world today wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something
<START> a really cool flick a must for any music <UNK> you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie before the movie i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols the only thing is required is an open mind br br the movie centers around the brian <UNK> massacre the dandy warhols have a role in the film as the <UNK> band ' but they are second <UNK> to the <UNK> the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed but then again they didn't have the element of excitement and <UNK> of the <UNK> you can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man anton <UNK> by itself it's an insightful film and study on the music industry just watch this film and enjoy
<START> this is the second <UNK> short and the first of them to be what one could call <UNK> it contains a lot of references <UNK> and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes i've heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine i don't think that's true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren't particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves i'd say it does a great job of that the plot is good it plays as a historical document <UNK> what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like the voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it the animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery this has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity the disc holds a commentary not in english but subtitled and worth a listen read there is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so i would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well i recommend this to anyone who enjoys the matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10
<START> not that a film by <UNK> <UNK> filled me with hope but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of <UNK> digital video for their early projects which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock but many of these young filmmakers have also <UNK> up to the notion of <UNK> the finished movie so that it appears <UNK> more like celluloid the effect is never perfect but it helps <UNK> digital video really only works for the <UNK> style because it never looks like anything other than video <UNK> lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer it does not feel like watching a movie and what's even more unforgivable is that the <UNK> is not a young filmmaker he ought to know better he ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror or even suspense on video for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business and lucky us he wrote the script too so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing <UNK> behavior and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly <UNK> please please miss this film you'll thank me later
<START> this is the best and most original show seen in years the more i watch it the more i fall in love with it the cast is excellent the writing is great i personally like every character however there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life i believe abc has done a <UNK> to the writers actors and to the potential audience of this show to <UNK> so quickly and not <UNK> it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following there are so few shows i watch anymore as most tv is awful this show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites <UNK> <UNK> and brothers and sisters in fact i think the same audience for brothers and sisters would love this show if they even knew about it why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away i am so sick of reality shows i do not watch any of them it was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors this show had so much promise the recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real please watch this show on <UNK> video and let abc know you wish to have this show back please sign the online <UNK> to abc http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> warner bros made many <UNK> in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced <UNK> and very entertaining i really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life this is one of <UNK> few hard edged <UNK> that simply doesn't work edward g robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who <UNK> the 20 year old story of a <UNK> with tragic consequences robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the <UNK> h b warner <UNK> <UNK> and boris karloff are good but the bad acting of frances <UNK> and anthony <UNK> in the second leads really hurts the movie <UNK> is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie in addition the <UNK> tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre code hollywood <UNK> direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations <UNK> <UNK> camera work is strong somehow this piece of dreck got an oscar nomination for best picture in a year that gave us m dracula and frankenstein
<START> you have to figure that when the <UNK> name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads cuba gooding j r some nice car chase shoot 'em up blow 'em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is <UNK> at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of <UNK> at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all i can think is that andy <UNK> must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he can't have something on all of them can he
<START> kids like these could have been a decent film given the subject matter but instead it has become a below average run of the mill tv movie of the week with not much going for it the acting is stale the plot predictable and the direction non existent for a better movie on the same subject try the excellent le <UNK> <UNK> a film that really cares about the people with down syndrome in kids like these they are merely used as an excuse for <UNK> sentimentality pretty appalling 1 10
<START> weak plot unlikely car <UNK> and helpless <UNK> characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old <UNK> episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as <UNK> i was <UNK> this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies i have ever seen br br if you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry
<START> mel <UNK> and victor <UNK> in their younger years serve to make this film interesting and especially viewing a young sinatra on the sunny side of 30 and definitely conveying that this was his yes i'm a popular singer but hardly an actor yet stage <UNK> morgan is an annoying inane presence and jack <UNK> is an actor whose appeal has always been totally lost on me leon <UNK> is silly as always but overall pretty funny 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right grade because with the combination of its positive aspects along with the lack of much of a story and a silly one at that and the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> it is overall average at best most of the fascination is from the viewing of the three entertainment icons in their early years
<START> for those of us baby <UNK> who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et al martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature br br the premise is easy enough cool hood meets small town sheriff and all hell ensues but the nuts and <UNK> of this movie <UNK> the car nut in all of us br br no this isn't casablanca nor is it great literature but it is a serious movie about cars rebellion and the genius that is martin sheen br br enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is and for what martin will become i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70's and you will too
<START> i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it's a film about an internet s m star of cd <UNK> that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she's murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of <UNK> the cd <UNK> which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow br br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he's in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him <UNK> the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won't even explain the ending because quite frankly i can't make it out myself but before the final scene we're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all br br all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you <UNK> at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining
<START> unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it it's obviously a low budget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work that's not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didn't know how bad though it's bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that <UNK> the laws of physics and wire fighting there's no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again it's obviously a kid's movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like <UNK> street or something it's bearable but much better if you're say nine
<START> this movie was great the first time i saw it when it was called lost in translation but somehow bill murray turned into an eccentric black man played by morgan freeman scarlett johansson turned into a <UNK> latino woman played by paz vega and tokyo japan turned into carson california instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in translation we get meaningless <UNK> in 10 items that <UNK> on annoying instead of characters that were <UNK> and <UNK> as in translation we get characters that <UNK> pointless advice on topics they have no clue about how can a character that wears hundred dollar t shirts and has never been inside a target department store expect to give advice to a working class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an <UNK> assistant don't think that stops him if he isn't giving her clothing advice he's telling her what she should eat the most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an <UNK> and yet the characters keep finding time to run another <UNK> be it <UNK> the car stopping at <UNK> or just laying around to list off their 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate i kept wanting to yell at them saying didn't you say you had somewhere to be what the heck are doing a minute ago you were practically late now you're eating <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> your lives until i saw this movie i never truly understood how something could insist upon itself but i think this movie does exactly that and <UNK> so the dialogue makes the characters cheesy and <UNK> the exception that i felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project
<START> before she went into politics or public service glenda jackson was one of <UNK> finest film actresses this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years and jenny played by american ann <UNK> in an almost <UNK> role as the <UNK> sister alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss <UNK> by the shell shock during world war i sir ian <UNK> has a smaller role as the doctor treating him you see familiar faces like sheila keith <UNK> <UNK> and frank <UNK> you can't help but watch glenda play a <UNK> housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes it's not the greatest movie but it's good to see <UNK> amazing talent she is still a fantastic actress comedy or drama she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her
<START> utterly pretentious nonsense the material is dull dull dull and most of the cast wouldn't even have made <UNK> in allen's earlier films and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me <UNK> the second rate though mysteriously popular ferrell even more it appears that the <UNK> 70 year old allen should have knocked off work when the clock <UNK> in a new century br br i truly tried to get involved in the film but it was just impossible my <UNK> couldn't fire that slowly so rather than <UNK> off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an <UNK> position i got up left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re read george <UNK> great <UNK> of 30 years ago germans the day turned out pretty well after all no thanks to woody
<START> i rated basic instinct 2 high yet that movie got less than a 4 rating this film only got a 4 from me but it has 7 3 from over <UNK> people i don't see a reason why they like this film so much br br this film is boring because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house and it only has a total of 5 people in this film it is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary many of dialogues are slow and meaningless the film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch the film can just be <UNK> to a few sentences br br this film reminds me of three times directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that one is equally boring the dialogues are also equally boring it also has a high rating i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished br br this film lacks of passion or excitement
<START> i was looking forward to kathryn <UNK> movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 oscars which it was awarded unfortunately it really isn't a good movie the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as <UNK> and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and <UNK> the actors put in a good effort but for me i didn't really get what the movie was trying to be it's not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket not as epic as band of brothers not as action packed as well anything i certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are <UNK> it <UNK> to these epic proportions mind you given the <UNK> of movies in the last couple of years i suppose there's not a lot to choose from
<START> steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices family and pressure by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat out comedy lots of laughs and unrealistic elements but i guess i was wrong sure the movie had some comedy but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance the movie itself really <UNK> true observations and that was a strong element i found but the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable through out the cinematography was great the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important though it came down to old flat and predictable ending i'd <UNK> if different choices were made at the end of the movie perhaps for the bad even this movie would get better publicity still a fun movie
<START> rural family drama with perhaps a nod to ordinary people concerns a young boy who <UNK> into himself after <UNK> <UNK> his older brother in a shooting <UNK> despite downbeat subject matter given mercilessly <UNK> treatment by director christopher cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring unfortunately the isolated <UNK> atmosphere and the <UNK> of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a <UNK> experience what with robert duvall glenn close and <UNK> <UNK> in the cast the movie is nearly a small <UNK> reunion of the natural too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really <UNK> out a gripping memorable picture 1 2 from
<START> i have copies of both these movies the classic where robert blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the 1967 movie blake is more shown standing by a window in jail telling his childhood life where it makes since why he killed the clutter family doesn't show much in the classic of what really went on an doesn't tell us which one really done the killing but it's a great eye <UNK> really if you watch the 1996 movie in cold blood the classic makes a lot more <UNK>
<START> big rock candy mountain is amazing i watched it when i was little and still do to this day senior in high school if i could imagine heaven that is what it would look like i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and my best friend little bunny <UNK> <UNK> is the man it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night in fact my friend who is 18 recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit thanks bye
<START> another movie that relies upon the trite worn out cliché of the mad scientist gone <UNK> the movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead back to life i know i know you've never heard that one before of course as all of these movies go the experiment goes very very wrong and creates a <UNK> <UNK> creature for this promising setup you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful wrong like many movies of this era the idea is nice but the execution and the script is mediocre not the worst horror movie i've seen no <UNK> the <UNK> 2 still takes the cake but not one of the gems either
<START> elvira mistress of the dark is just that a campy <UNK> of fun sex appeal horror and comedy all <UNK> into a low cut black <UNK> and <UNK> with a sky high black <UNK> hair do this movie is sure to delight any fan of <UNK> it takes you <UNK> and personal with elvira and <UNK> deep into her um past revealing her enormous <UNK> br br the movie takes you on a ride with elvira as she goes from tv horror <UNK> with the <UNK> to her home town of <UNK> mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased great aunt where she encounters a <UNK> town a <UNK> cinema owner a creepy great uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks a slew of high school kids that immediately love her and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town even if it means burning her at the stake watch elvira woo the kids stalk the stud avoid her creepy great uncle and thumb her nose at the <UNK> uptight <UNK> who have no kind words for her in elvira mistress of the dark br br as elvira would say i guarantee it'll be a scream screams in background <UNK> good thing i didn't say it'd be a gas
<START> with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only 60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job br br they have combined state of the art digital animation the perfectly cast voice talents of ray <UNK> john <UNK> and dennis <UNK> among many others to create a highly entertaining family film with a strong message about <UNK> friendship and caring for your fellow herd members and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd br br while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders br br david newman yet another member of the newman family of hollywood <UNK> provides a superb score that is not <UNK> yet serves to move the action along and at times is positively toe <UNK> br br the overall look of the film is incredible an intensely <UNK> strangely believable <UNK> of snow <UNK> mud rocks and ice the individual characters were delightfully believable too with the facial expressions of ray <UNK> <UNK> being a particular treat br br the entire sequence with the <UNK> will leave no doubt as to where the expression dumb as a <UNK> comes from ' br br this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or <UNK> children pretty much <UNK> but real nonetheless br br it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home
<START> some of the posters seem less than <UNK> because this is neither mark <UNK> nor <UNK> and hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either you'll look a long time to find a greater <UNK> and hart fan than me but burke and van <UNK> weren't exactly chopped <UNK> in addition to which they knew der <UNK> inside out and <UNK> some great songs but beautiful <UNK> becomes you it's always you the day after forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected <UNK> once and for always plus a couple of upbeat philosophy <UNK> entries in if you <UNK> your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing the flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously why else make <UNK> a heavy when in most if not all of the other versions he is more a friend mentor to arthur so if you start wondering <UNK> why sir <UNK> who has been sold to historians as the epitome of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> bully you're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie on balance it does what it sets out to do entertain so good luck to it

<START> everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie my grandma could have done better than that but that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad it's actually so bad that i'm not able to write a sentence without <UNK> mark if the first episode of <UNK> <UNK> was a quite good <UNK> comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is <UNK> badly the <UNK> of the first one the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it <UNK> is over acting his role even more than in the first part robin is trying to act like <UNK> because she's replacing her but that's <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> robin is robin even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because she's not acting as she used to act i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played <UNK> playing her <UNK> as for the story it's just too much of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but <UNK> and <UNK> should <UNK> tried to write a more simple story like the first episode the gags are repetitive childish and <UNK> <UNK> no really there's no more than 3 funny parts in this the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects so you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a <UNK> <UNK> 2 10
<START> this is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring arnold <UNK> in one of his most memorable roles set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything including the television networks one of their most popular tv shows is the running man where convicted <UNK> are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions it's set up like a game show where the audience votes for their favorite <UNK> trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky contestants audience members also win <UNK> for correctly <UNK> who will be killed by whom and the host is played by none other than family <UNK> richard dawson who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role when ben richards arnold is <UNK> accused of mass murder he is forced to play this sadistic game br br this movie is chock full of classic arnold one liners such as his famous i'll be back right before he enters the <UNK> and he <UNK> a stalker armed with a <UNK> with how about a light i could go on and on but i don't want to spoil the movie it's funny stuff br br whether it was intended or not this movie serves as a great parody of today's reality tv <UNK> already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and <UNK> for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are <UNK> for their entertainment value running man demonstrates what would happen if reality tv hit rock bottom and it is a scary picture one can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far br br overall this is a fun film i highly recommend it 9 out of 10
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen got so bored that i switched it off <UNK> through to watch the news when i switched it back on i fell asleep the film starts with a dream continues with a dream and ends with a dream then there are a few more dreams in between come on what is supposed to keep me interested in that a film needs to have a reason to be interesting the minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film goer switches off ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them this is it br br absolutely awful
<START> bye bye <UNK> isn't one of the best musicals of all time but it's great fun and accessible to many audiences the original film could have been wonderful with dick van dyke <UNK> his signature broadway role but instead they <UNK> with the plot so the film is very unsatisfying this re make which aired on abc in 1995 is far more faithful to the original script and includes some original songs as well that were used in a national tour which this film took off from which starred tommy tune and ann <UNK> who choreographed this film br br jason alexander is a very different type from dick van dyke but he is well cast as albert before his seinfeld days he started in musical theater vanessa williams is a perfect fit for rose their is also great work from <UNK> <UNK> as mae and mark <UNK> as conrad <UNK> a role he played on the national tour br br this film is not without it's problems though a major <UNK> is <UNK> phillips who however appealing simply looks and seems too old to be teenage kim and george <UNK> is somewhat bland as her father somewhat throwing the number kids away a number original cast member paul <UNK> stole the show with br br but all in all this is a delightful well done film which the material deserved

<START> i won't describe the story as that has been done elsewhere we are great clive owen fans and when our netflix recommended the movie we were intrigued br br no wonder we had never heard of this movie because it was a bbc television movie back in 1992 hence the poor production values grainy image jerky camera work and poor sound br br but you don't really mind the <UNK> because the story itself will put you to sleep it's an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending you don't really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile
<START> this is a classic example of an increasing problem with films why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically <UNK> than the dialogue what sense does that make this film isn't alone most films seem to do this now for 2 years i wondered if it was just something wrong with my tv but then i got a new tv there it is again background noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors <UNK> out the dialogue br br it was even more distracting in this film because in the english version anyway the woman <UNK> constantly i kept hoping jean reno would say excuse me would you speak up or get the <UNK> out of your mouth if you watch it on dvd you have even high school french i recommend the french version with subtitles br br i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon people rave about the scenery but i saw it on a tv i lived in the <UNK> for a few years so <UNK>

<START> simply put the movie is boring cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together it seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary the main plot is very thin a cia agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting so a kid dies which results in the natural response of the father <UNK> <UNK> the person <UNK> responsible for his son's death the lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around why no one knows some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship br br all in all this is one of the worst movies i have seen in quite a while i was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged i neither laughed nor cried i did not gain an understanding nor was i compelled to learn more or take up a cause it meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie

<START> this is without doubt the best documentary ever produced giving an accurate and epic depiction of world war 2 from the invasion of <UNK> in 1939 to the end of the war in 1945 br br honest and to the point this documentary presents views from both sides of the conflict giving a very human face to the war at the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not overlooked much work has been put into the giving a detailed picture of the war and in particularly the high low and turning points in the allies <UNK> being a british produced documentary this 26 part series focus is mainly on britain but russia and america's contribution are not <UNK> over this is but one such advantage of a series of such length br br another worthy mention is the score the music and the whole feel of the documentary is one of turmoil struggle and <UNK> like a film this series leaves the viewer in no doubt of the <UNK> faced by the allies and the germans during the war its build to a climax at the end of every episode which serves to <UNK> the coarse of the second world war after watching all 26 the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge about the war and <UNK> at just how much we owe to the members of the previous generation

<START> this was a waste of 75 minutes of my life the acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous it revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her and then <UNK> them for money one of the victims is a candidate for da which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife another is a plastic surgeon also married and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too meanwhile the evil <UNK> girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around it ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven the women get naked a lot too mostly in situations that stretch reality bad bad bad
<START> of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime <UNK> <UNK> wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy he was a great story <UNK> and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing so <UNK> <UNK> did if you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy <UNK> <UNK> was the main actor that starred in his stories my uncle visited australia and my town in 1968 to check out locations for a girl in australia and created a great movie about a <UNK> bride after the second world war you can see his humor in all his movies i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently great
<START> i'm a big fan of lucio fulci many of his giallo and splatter flicks are amongst my favourites of all time but this made for tv movie is extremely sub par and not what i've come to expect from the great italian director the film is neither interesting like some of <UNK> more tame <UNK> or gory like the majority of his cult classics thus leaving it lacking in both major areas and ultimately <UNK> that the film isn't very good the film works from a plot that has been used many times previously but still it's an idea that always has the chance of <UNK> an interesting story just because it focuses on the theme of the <UNK> which is the ultimate unknown this film focuses on <UNK> <UNK> a man that isn't exactly well liked and after he dies of an apparent stomach <UNK> there aren't many people that are sad to see him go this means that his ghost is trapped somewhere between life and the <UNK> and so he decides to try and get to the bottom of his death and his only ally in this <UNK> is his daughter br br the video that i saw this film on is proudly <UNK> that the film is in the style of <UNK> <UNK> and that's one of the most blatant attempts to sell a film i've ever seen there is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale and the reason for that <UNK> would appear to be because of title similarity to the stuart gordon <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> which is a lot better the film does benefit from a distinctly italian style and the score is rather good unfortunately however fulci has seen fit to positively <UNK> every scene in it and so the theme quickly becomes annoying the plot plays out in a really boring way and most of the scenes simply involve the ghost <UNK> trying to find things out or the daughter placing her <UNK> over her family members this movie was made for italian tv and so it's not surprising that it's all rather tame there's a little bit of gore and a nightmare sequence with zombies but this isn't the fulci we all know and love overall this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of <UNK> talents not worth bothering with unless you're a fulci <UNK>
<START> when i saw this film on <UNK> i thought it would be a scary movie apparently it wasn't i have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site <UNK> is a site that shows scary horror movies br br the acting is wonderful from all the actors i hated the story the story was stupid the movie starts out with a man with a <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> onto it he breaks the seal and certain disasters happen the water turns to blood the <UNK> die out the moon turns red etc br br the female character was annoying as well a lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it <UNK> it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts <UNK> it and asking religious people what it all means br br spoiler alert br br the two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that god told him to murder his parents and the end where <UNK> moore dies after giving birth to her baby and <UNK> her soul into it br br here's what happens the mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins <UNK> moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive <UNK> and gives birth to her child she touches her child's head <UNK> her soul into the child and then dies then the apocalypse stops br br why does god all of a sudden have a change of heart he gets furious when the <UNK> allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman <UNK> her soul into her baby br br end spoiler br br the movie is pretty stupid it's another religious end of the world propaganda piece the acting from <UNK> moore and michael <UNK> and everybody else is excellent that's about all there is br br i give this movie 2 stars out of 10 good acting with a lot of nonsense
<START> 80 minutes and it felt twice that long brief crossing is not brief enough indeed the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue more of a monologue really of a woman approaching middle age <UNK> <UNK> about men disappointment sex aging and her recent <UNK> to a french teenager she met in the <UNK> <UNK> br br the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty free shop and to a bar where finally her self involved rant pushes him away the story can't end there of course so she <UNK> him to listen to her <UNK> on more as she brings him to her cabin br br what little romance sex or for that matter anything at all this film has besides bitter <UNK> is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all yes the ending is very nicely done but it is <UNK> reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a <UNK> <UNK> br br of course some people like it i could be wrong
<START> this is a really funny and sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting it's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the movie's more serious parts it's a unique movie about two doctors and i don't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great wood <UNK> character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> and brian white and <UNK> are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it go you won't be disappointed it's worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award
<START> simply but <UNK> filmed studio set performance short a perfect match of music and images that <UNK> the very <UNK> of cool and the <UNK> of hip the precise visual and musical <UNK> give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session what it is is a pop video every bit as <UNK> and knowing as that implies and all the better for it among the very best music films ever made and almost certainly the most cinematic these cats are solid gone daddy o
<START> first of all that i would like to say is that edison <UNK> is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before <UNK> this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far shows a poverty lifestyle background of a <UNK> the <UNK> edison aka <UNK> goes around killing people to survive himself has done it throughout his entire life sam lee's <UNK> duty is to capture the <UNK> for good there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it the movie shows the struggles between those two characters they both beat each other like angry dogs go and watch <UNK> strongly <UNK> go hk films
<START> visually disjointed and full of itself the director apparently chose to seek faux depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an <UNK> minute <UNK> fest br br the moments that work in this film are very limited and the characters don't even feel real how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal br br <UNK> and <UNK> it all feels like a quirky dream sequence jarring <UNK> camera work awkward <UNK> and gaps in action and what's with the little spider image <UNK> across the screen whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school it added no meaning just cheese and didn't even <UNK> work with the rest of the film assuming the film even had a style which is a close call what a flop
<START> this film proves that the commercial cinema or else the hollywood movies are in a serious crisis there is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on <UNK> name there is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more <UNK> than a <UNK> what else the screen is somewhat dim <UNK> is a bad actor but francis <UNK> is even worse br br rating 1 10
<START> i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend's recommendation i can honestly say that i cannot remember another intimate dramatic film which does so many things so well the writing is crisp realistic nuanced and even restrained the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired <UNK> the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close ups and framing of images capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways the acting is also wonderful with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer they reveal their <UNK> weaknesses with <UNK> raw vulnerability a real triumph for roger <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the team a must see for serious film lovers
<START> keeping all political views aside <UNK> khan and anil <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> is a good movie that cleverly explores the confused towards family side of <UNK> <UNK> gandhi and the fight of his <UNK> son harilal gandhi with the society his larger than life father and most importantly demons in his head one draws parallels to gandhi the father of the nation and struggles any son could have with their father br br the acting is good <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> strictly in that order add color and pathos to this heart wrenching tale of harilal who <UNK> to be <UNK> just once and also runs away at the <UNK> touch of the finger br br <UNK> <UNK> direction and the production <UNK> is lavish and attractive however the screenplay could've been <UNK> i had seen the play some years ago on a <UNK> video type dvd it was called <UNK> vs gandhi i think and it was certainly more gripping though the movie's background score and the father son and mother son moments are just a brilliant treat br br this movie could have been great it's borderline to that it has the potential so huge to have been just a story differences between a father and son or just gandhi or even both somewhere the plot is lost and when you expect absolute epitome of emotions nothing comes to you br br it <UNK> <UNK> to other <UNK> certainly not an <UNK> film like <UNK> gandhi or abstract as kamal <UNK> hey ram the film just about manages to find its <UNK> however one is left wondering what if worth a watch 7 5 10
<START> just saw this at the chicago film festival avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems it is a film filled with <UNK> it opens with a minor quote from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and it's all downhill from there camera work imagine a child trying to imitate wong <UNK> <UNK> story line <UNK> robinson and the <UNK> the love i saw in you was just a <UNK> expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with <UNK> for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the <UNK> at the <UNK> church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid i want 2 hours of my life <UNK> julian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the viewing with comment that the film was controversial that is true only for the film's <UNK> effect
<START> when you wish for the dragon to eat every cast member you know you're in for a bad ride br br i went in with very very low expectations having read some of the other comments and was not let down unlike some other cheap and failed movies however this one doesn't really remain hilariously and unintentionally funny throughout br br spoilers follow br br first of all plot it very inconsistent looking past the small mistakes such as the dragon growing up in 3 hours the whole idea it's based on is messed up see the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of <UNK> which really were dragon eggs after explaining this they show some <UNK> <UNK> at one with his <UNK> and the dragon pops out later the obligatory crazy scientist guy <UNK> on about how dragons <UNK> the dinosaurs so apparently humans were around when dinosaurs were or we just have a fine little plot hole here the other major thing is that the lab is blown up with a force half as strong as what was used for <UNK> then two guys later walk in to check everything out and it's almost <UNK> there's even another dragon which grew out of who knows what all in all it's very predictable as soon as the guy mentioned <UNK> i guessed they'd clone a dragon that means that our mr <UNK> pants security guy isn't so <UNK> and smart as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that i knew this film would be about you know dragons br br putting that aside the second worst thing is the special effects others have mentioned the fake rocks falling during the beginning the cg helicopter and the dragon it looks a bit better than a blob but it ruined whatever it had going for it when it <UNK> down the hall in the same manner time after time to their credit the flying dragons in the beginning looked ok from far away although the one in the cave is probably the worst one in the whole movie these things are funny to watch however the scenes where a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are shown are not nor are the introduction screens with the vital <UNK> br br coming to the actors they weren't the greatest but i guess at least they tried they seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors <UNK> in the recent <UNK> for example and you've got to give them points for that one thing i noticed though was that the woman who plays meredith often had her face covered in make up that was many tones lighter than the rest of her she looked like she had a bad run in with some white face br br the script is bad and cheesy you don't really notice the music but it's actually not too bad for the most part br br the bottom line is don't watch it unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad like i did although the only funny things are the bad cg effects other than that don't waste your time and money
<START> i can't understand all the hype about this movie ok if you like cheap splatter you will love this movie but if you like good stories and good actors don't watch this personally i really disliked the actors in this movie they seem to be hired straight from the street the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next the overall quality of this movie lacks of the <UNK> very low budget when we saw this movie me and 3 other people we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this just to get their <UNK> at a film school with the lowest effort another issue that really <UNK> the whole experience is the bad <UNK> very shaking and the bad sound the whole movie seems to be <UNK> with a single <UNK>
<START> i saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when i was barely 16 while viewing another film oh how excited me and my best friend were we couldn't wait for the month or so until it would come on i saw this movie 17 times that year at the theatre i love love love it kris is so perfect for the film he is <UNK> and kinda trashy but also shy and uncertain with <UNK> and it is so endearing to watch it again when they sing <UNK> at the studio and he <UNK> in with his <UNK> voice so very different from the perfect notes coming from her but i always thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie the way he looks at her and he is so proud i could watch this movie every day we tried to dress like <UNK> her i even have the long <UNK> and cap that was so like the one she wore this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to maybe its just that i was so caught up into it at an age when everything was extreme don't know the ending always has me in tears even today
<START> the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect it's a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill <UNK> directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a <UNK> version br br still there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton br br it's a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all <UNK> well enough to make them true twists br br the child actors in the movie do a great too i'm usually <UNK> of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as <UNK> rejects but both these kids do a good job br br this movie is not gory it's not very scary but it is very very creepy
<START> i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming reese <UNK> is so charming and jason <UNK> not so bad either it is so sweet watching dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet <UNK> my heart at the same time watching court fall in love with maureen however it is even <UNK> watching how much he cares for dani i must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for dani in the end it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie watching him die made me cry for a whole day i just could not believe it however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then maureen and dani they really can make it through anything i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen
<START> this show is dull lame and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it original first off the animation is so ugly <UNK> hideous and everyone's annoying the twins look like teen female <UNK> from <UNK> lab and johnny is almost like a more intelligent male dee dee also from <UNK> lab secondly the plots are painfully lame making them hard to follow the gags are corny and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit especially when it tries to be funny i only saw two episodes but those alone turned me off br br third off the whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to green day's american idiot and while i am not a big fan of that band i find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody and then subtly change it in order to make it their own br br case in point it's a big fat ugly bore 1 10
<START> you want to see the movie the <UNK> by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of time br br all of the good comments here seem to be written by poorly disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to <UNK> fake interest br br this movie is not a well done <UNK> comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are insulting br br the movie is so mean spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being <UNK> in this manner you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it br br the movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic <UNK>
<START> i watched this movie once and might watch it again but although jamie foxx is good in the movie i feel they could have used a <UNK> <UNK> character as alvin sanders <UNK> scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar <UNK> david morse are too funny david morse again is a wonderful <UNK> of a cop his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role once again morse meets doug <UNK> <UNK> in the theater morse ends up coming down hard on <UNK> they are both perfect for this scenario in each film i personally love that quality in a film where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film as these two did in the green mile overall it was a pretty good movie
<START> this movie gets both a 6 10 rating from me as well as a 9 10 here is why as a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration this movie will bore you it's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the lifetime channel but put in a horror universe the story and formula are age old <UNK> hundreds of times if you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts you'll be disappointed take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as a beautiful mind <UNK> on cheese this is the 6 10 br br however the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over the top it's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk but that joke actually got a theatrical release the idea gets a 9 10 from me the only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further but they didn't br br the mix of both is mixed i thought it was funny but as with most all comedies it wasn't that funny i had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted there were moments of utter genius but there were also moments of pure boredom br br i sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over the top risk and original ideas i just can't say it was perfect or even near it because of the lack of originality to the plot br br a great family movie a great movie to watch with a bunch of guys or girls a great movie to watch with anyone but if you watch it alone it will be a bit boring other people always make this kind of movie funnier and <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> ok so it's an adult movie but it really is very <UNK> done it's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was even the acting was fairly decent the plot was more solid than most adult films i've seen the camera work was above average it's just a good flick
<START> frank sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns he was a great actor from here to eternity and the man with the golden arm are a proof of that but he did not have the <UNK> of a western hero you identified him as an urban guy but he tried to do his job well in johnny <UNK> the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault i blame it on two factors a the story was too unusual specially in the fact that sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie in a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern to break away from it the film has to be very good b the story is not convincing it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother also when a man shows him a special <UNK> that will open <UNK> so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him <UNK> why all the <UNK> have not adopted it i think that this film should not have been <UNK> because any film with sinatra is worth seeing and in spite of its shortcomings it is still enjoyable
<START> well <UNK> i must say that it <UNK> me to no end when someone <UNK> me out and tries to make fun of me especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do my favorite part of your post was but no big bang bang good guy bad guy here <UNK> me suggest you stick to movie with <UNK> bang bang br br well said i do like action movies especially if they are well done but i also like movies that don't have a whole lot of action as long as they are well done i'm sorry but <UNK> and lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie i really don't see very many non american films so maybe i was spoiled and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when i saw secrets and lies perhaps if i judge foreign movies by a different standard i could some day see how secrets and lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the imdb hmm if true that is very scary br br jeremy <UNK> bits <UNK> net new e mail
<START> someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date i have since <UNK> everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie it's just terrible without going into lengthy <UNK> of the various scenes take my word for it the sex scenes are uninteresting at best jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film she does look good but it's all downhill from there
<START> i'm a huge classic film buff but am just getting in to silent movies a lot of silent films don't hold my attention but show people is a notable exception br br marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture davies in particular shows a wide range as she <UNK> from a <UNK> small town girl to a <UNK> who takes herself a bit too seriously br br show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film i know that doesn't make much sense but that's what happened the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary br br show people is a perfect introduction to silent films it is a fast paced interesting film with two of the silent <UNK> best stars add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the <UNK> <UNK> list for all classic film buffs
<START> richard <UNK> the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn't even stand to hear mentioned  he even <UNK> up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for <UNK> in his later years  but then the director did run off with his wife so it's understandable for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the 50s and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment br br in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony <UNK> westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way here <UNK> legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but after a buffalo <UNK> costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice he's dragged back into the darkness by robert <UNK> <UNK> and proudly racist <UNK> <UNK> it on the grounds that i've already got the guilty conscience i might as well have the money as well raised by indians he's fully aware of the damage he's doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for <UNK> and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self loathing as taylor is with hate when the two men fall out over debra <UNK> <UNK>  the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills  and a white buffalo hide that's priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons a showdown becomes inevitable though the outcome certainly isn't br br <UNK> is certainly ironic casting  it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that gave taylor his 50s comeback after years of steady decline his hair color may not convince but his performance does a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn't wear a gun the gun wears him <UNK> accent isn't always convincing but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold trying to keep hold of his <UNK> decency and <UNK> his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make <UNK> russ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lloyd <UNK> one <UNK> old <UNK> also give as good as they get but the real star is the script tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character  not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining  it <UNK> historical <UNK> with entertaining drama without ever selling either short the new french dvd is extras free but does <UNK> a 2 35 1 transfer with an english soundtrack
<START> something i really love about this woman's short films was the <UNK> of theme especially in living with happiness this film has some nice <UNK> unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment but fails to succeed with clunky <UNK> dialogue <UNK> performances and very television coverage br br it's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema the ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial but the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much br br i really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity
<START> the only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly <UNK> i would rather <UNK> my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again even for a tv movie it is flat the cast is boring the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand how two directors <UNK> to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise and it is shot in <UNK> mo and cut short at the anticipated pay off if you are tempted to see this pop it in set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get <UNK> with any luck you'll <UNK> off quickly and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over namely this movie
<START> in what i can say was a <UNK> of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie <UNK> is obviously a <UNK> reviewer the plot is thin to say the least the <UNK> dialog is not funny see this movie at your peril br br david <UNK> from shanghai <UNK> should be after the movie for the little or no <UNK> this movie will generate the banal plot attempts to compete with other <UNK> <UNK> out there and just <UNK> into the scenery it was like watching paint dry br br in short this movie was a total waste of time and space i've seen better movies on youtube
<START> despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the <UNK> <UNK> relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and john <UNK> shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is one note and irritating br br the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained
<START> i did not have too much interest in watching the flock andrew <UNK> co directed the masterpiece trilogy of <UNK> affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an <UNK> director called <UNK> <UNK> i had the feeling that <UNK> had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study so they fired him and hired another director this usually does not work well let's remember the invasion but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected it's not a great film but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well also the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances now let's go to the negative points one element which really bothered me there was a moment in which it irritated me was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more attitude and style that tricks feel out of place and their presence is <UNK> plus i think the film should have been more ambitious in spite of that i recommend the flock as a good thriller it's not memorable at all but it's entertaining
<START> i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the <UNK> <UNK> film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a comment review on this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs excellent acting and an inspiring message ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life this is <UNK> illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and <UNK> of individuals in various <UNK> and <UNK> enter into a pool of water this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and <UNK> in captivating scenes which hold your attention and imagination
<START> to die for has it all this film has a great cast lots and lots of romance and terror not too gory but still enough to appeal to horror fans there are a lot more vampire love stories if you are a fan of vampire love stories i strongly recommend this film 10 10
<START> at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters <UNK> set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of <UNK> meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don't waste your time or money
<START> this movie is a joke i mean a ha ha funny joke why because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer <UNK> of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting wow br br within this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how why are there four black women who are <UNK> <UNK> and what is their purpose since when does 6 people make up a nation of zombies and is <UNK> black eye <UNK> scary to anyone anywhere even a 2 year old br br and lastly why was this movie made at all why why why no answer that's what i thought br br on the demand channel they actually <UNK> this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance lol at least they had the decency to do this much
<START> ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way through br br this film is mild <UNK> and <UNK> the story is so <UNK> it <UNK> your teeth on the opening titles a tail of two <UNK> children learning about <UNK> the fairy story way which frankly left me rather <UNK> it uses the irish <UNK> in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an <UNK> accent all in all why do they <UNK> these out
<START> this movie doesn't have an awful lot to do with it's predecessor robot <UNK> this must be also the reason why its most common name is robot wars and not the alternate name robot <UNK> 2 robot wars br br robot <UNK> was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future this concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides isn't very original or cleverly written a shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch br br just like robot <UNK> this is a b movie but with as a big difference that it's just not a very good one perhaps this also has to with the fact that robot <UNK> got made during the <UNK> when b movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it even though the movie got released in 1990 this really can't be said about this movie it's just lame badly made poor looking and not exciting enough it also has an ending which leaves you thinking <UNK> is it that's all ' br br what the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot line really perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story some action or likable main characters br br seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie all of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially don michael paul is annoying as the main character who behaves as if he's god's gift to woman and mr perfect who can compete with anyone weren't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie br br for such a futuristic movie with a concept of having large battle <UNK> in it this movie surely is lacking with its action had they put some more and bigger action into the movie the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable br br you can better watch a mighty <UNK> power rangers episode for some more action and <UNK> br br 3 10
<START> redundant but again the case if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics in this case schneider then you should go basic <UNK> man's life is saved by having various animal organs <UNK> into him unfortunately he takes on each <UNK> characteristics former survivor <UNK> looks pretty good here now that she doesn't have open <UNK> on her legs and a little makeup on her face d
<START> farrah fawcett gives an award nominated performance as an attempted rape victim who turns the tables on her <UNK> this movie not only makes you examine your own morals it proves that fawcett can <UNK> as a serious actress both as a victim and victor
<START> brian <UNK> is often <UNK> upon as a director for his trashy gore <UNK> but the truth is that his films actually aren't bad at all the re animator sequels aren't as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series and society isn't a world away from being a <UNK> horror masterpiece this thriller certainly isn't a masterpiece but it shows <UNK> eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging i'm really surprised that a horror movie about <UNK> didn't turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear it's running away from a tiger for the modern world <UNK> doesn't <UNK> me but surprisingly i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows <UNK> dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife's affair with the pool <UNK> and his life isn't the only one as it's his patients who feel the full <UNK> of his anger br br when it comes to <UNK> the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for <UNK> the full <UNK> of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i'm not <UNK> about going to the dentist yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that there's more to the film than what we're seeing it isn't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level and while this won't be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while b class is actually quite impressive with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian <UNK> for casting ken <UNK> in the movie the dawn of the dead star doesn't get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast doesn't <UNK> impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i don't hesitate to recommend this film
<START> let me state first that i love westerns civil war stories i also consider john ford as an excellent director i also have the same high feelings for john wayne william <UNK> acting ability br br i cannot remember if i saw this film when it first came out in 1959 last night was the first time i saw it since then br br as per my 4 rating one can say i did not like the movie br br i now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings br br john lee <UNK> who wrote the screenplay from harold <UNK> novel was a very gifted writer wrote many fine scripts this script is poorly written badly <UNK> they make mention of the awful conditions of the <UNK> prison at the time of the movie <UNK> was not in operation they also use <UNK> that were not used at the time br br john ford was directing films for over 40 years won 4 oscars he must have been ill during the making of this his usual style was missing it could be that this was film in the south east and not in <UNK> valley br br he normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film most were missing this time this time only minor cowboy stars hoot gibson ken <UNK> have roles of course anna lee has a small role there were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars see below mr <UNK> stock company made most of his films the classics they were sadly missed here br br now we come to the main stars john wayne william <UNK> the duke also must have been ill he seemed out of place here this sort of role usually fit his style perfectly he was just adequate here <UNK> <UNK> did the best he could but nowhere as good as he usually was br br it was required that there be an actress in this type of movie here in her first major role second film is <UNK> towers a very beautiful person but not really an actress she is still having roles on television let me be kind and say she has had a long career more based on her looks than acting talent also in <UNK> as ms towers servant is <UNK> star <UNK> gibson i am glad she stuck to <UNK> br br the rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other john ford films there were a few military type songs supposedly done by the <UNK> <UNK> not good at all the action scenes were good but come at the end of film br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 4 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed this one and although the ending made me angry i still give it 10 out of 10 br br four college girls <UNK> kelly <UNK> and <UNK> are driving down to florida on their way they meet 2 guys turner davis they really add nothing to the plot but are at least somewhat likable the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun but they have car problems and never make it one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help the other three stay by the car br br soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the <UNK> soon she witnesses as a man march <UNK> a woman in terror the girl <UNK> the area she doesn't get very far but manages to get lost br br her friends by the car go looking for her they too go into the woods and run into the same man one of them sees the dead woman the man responds by shooting the girls head off the other girl runs away manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed br br eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested this is when i started getting mad these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them br br they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell the remaining friend manages to escape but not without getting in dangerous situations br br this movie has nudity good actresses a shower scene imitating psycho graphic violence towards women and solid story some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending but over all this is a great little unknown movie
<START> we as a family were so delighted with 'the last of the blonde <UNK> we purchased a copy for our home video library br br the acting is <UNK> and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the music songs are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the <UNK> as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds br br full marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we <UNK> recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly laugh and lots of music
<START> i really enjoyed doctor <UNK> this is a low budget film which may be off putting to some but i have no problem with it i admire it even more for that considering it's way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood <UNK> out every year too bad this didn't get a theatrical release i don't know about anyone else but i would have went to see it in theatres doctor <UNK> is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy especially if they're into sci fi like i am i don't see why this is a r rated film only one f word is said and there are no gruesome death scenes nor is there any blood at all the timeless rivalry between <UNK> anton and <UNK> anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race while <UNK> wanted to <UNK> them gave the story a sense of <UNK> while the mythical <UNK> added charm to the story itself basically this a film that's just plain fun to watch there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie though seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit that makes me laugh every time i see it but i <UNK> anyway the acting is great the main protagonists anton and his lady friend samantha are very likable anton is sympathetic and <UNK> and samantha is friendly plus the settings were wonderful the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting we're only given a glimpse of it twice though it would have been great to see more scenes take place here the main setting was also very neat <UNK> apartment is very <UNK> and he has some cool devices especially the <UNK> system he uses to keep track of the world's <UNK> he even has a pet <UNK> that he keeps in his apartment named edgar overall this a great film it was fun to watch and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles if you can find anywhere that <UNK> doctor <UNK> you should rent it or in my case buy it it was definitely money well spent br br my rating 8 stars out of ten br br
<START> of the <UNK> of austen films from the 1990s this is my favorite more even than <UNK> which was the one that converted me to <UNK> before seeing this emma i had seen two previous versions but in one emma seemed all wrong more like lady <UNK> and in the other she seemed half wrong like a possible <UNK> whereas here she seemed just right young and silly and stubborn in general i thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well indeed it is one of the <UNK> <UNK> things i have ever seen rather in the nature of a christmas treat the script is unusually well formed and the <UNK> <UNK> like the <UNK> of light that reveals harriet to emma in church are all in keeping mark strong as knightley is not what i would have expected but i enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain spoken practical side of the character in contrast with <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> against frank <UNK> are quite funny bernard <UNK> makes mr <UNK> a figure of almost <UNK> absurdity samantha <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be and as in the same <UNK> pride and prejudice care is taken that the eventual <UNK> of characters can be believed uniquely in some cases for me this production was and remains a delight
<START> it's all up to you ed now you get to play the game the day my father left my mother he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend on opening day at the <UNK> <UNK> in hollywood i was but <UNK> years old i wasn't even entirely sure what i was seeing but i will never forgot it especially the scene with ned beatty br br watching it today thirty six years later it still gives me <UNK> br br my father was a huge burt reynolds fan hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an <UNK> movie ' i had seen two films at the <UNK> prior to this grand <UNK> and the song of <UNK> well this wasn't exactly mario <UNK> or the brady bunch after leaving the theater i was shell shocked br br but even at that tender age i appreciated the artistry and after seeing again today am i surprised i was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing yet extremely well crafted film br br suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a <UNK> year old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend i don't blame my father for taking me but it was a bit much for a child to witness br br as an adult i still find it quite disturbing yet i am still very impressed with the quality of the film making br br burt reynolds as an absolute wonder as are all the principles from billy <UNK> as the <UNK> guitar wonder to <UNK> cox as the terrified insurance salesman everyone does an admirable job the sound quality is second to none from the <UNK> birds to the <UNK> <UNK> the photography cinematography all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate br br the moral questions raised from murdering the sexual <UNK> to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released and the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such <UNK> brutality are life <UNK> these four men city men suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined raise the bar from action to horror br br it's a classic to be sure and the phrase you have a pretty mouth has been <UNK> endlessly from saturday night live to off the <UNK> comments around water <UNK> at work this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture as much as make my day or i'll be back ever were br br so what would you do if you found your friends being sexually <UNK> at <UNK> by mountain men far away from your life in the city <UNK> bed wife and kids and if you took the <UNK> burt reynolds did and i would have done the same would you bury the body beneath the soon to be lake or stand trial and take your chances the bottom line is deliverance delivers you can take that to the bank if this movie doesn't get under your skin then you are not human br br even if you have seen this before rent it again and ask yourself the above question br br my favorite part of the film remains the same ed failing to kill the deer then changing life and it's unpredictable <UNK> can change a man and i suppose that's what this film is all about jon voight in particular as ed gives the best performance here and he remains one of the more gifted actors in hollywood history from midnight cowboy to his highly underrated performance as franklin d <UNK> in pearl harbor his acting lifts the movie to another level climbing the rocks at <UNK> terrified and determined to make it right it needs to be seen to be believed i guarantee your heart rate will <UNK> to a new level br br <UNK> paced tense taut and tightly drawn as a as a <UNK> string this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today times have changes but our choices as human beings have not br br ten out of ten stars
<START> and anyone who watches this film will agree this film was directed in the days when plot character believability and theme actually <UNK> br br jean peters widmark and thelma ritter steal the spotlight ritter is in top form as informer moe she survives in the <UNK> section of ny acting as a <UNK> <UNK> for nyc police br br the only other film in which i have seen peters is <UNK> and she certainly proves her acting ability here complete with brooklyn accent widmark is appropriately menacing as the anti hero who must <UNK> what the right thing is despite his need for cash br br the photography is brilliant the <UNK> the subway station though it looks <UNK> than the real thing the harbor shack where widmark lives as a <UNK> excellent use is made of the city with lightning <UNK> in <UNK> the many <UNK> and <UNK> of the city are addressed here the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop 10 10
<START> charles bronson continued his 80's <UNK> with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade if not ever in it he plays a detective who goes to great <UNK> to track down a <UNK> who has <UNK> an asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest <UNK> it's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made a lot of people consider the death wish sequels to be <UNK> worst movies the death wish sequels weren't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable <UNK> however is an utterly dull thriller which is <UNK> by mean spirited racism and child <UNK> it really is a <UNK> film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to <UNK> a law and justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything indeed the movie begins with <UNK> sex being interrupted with bronson then <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> with a <UNK> the chicago theater i watched this in just <UNK> at the <UNK> of this scene only to gasp at the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the girl in this film it has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too <UNK> to save i want to point out that i think charles bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst the action sequences are poor also br br 1 2 out of 4 awful
<START> famous for introducing the world to hedy <UNK> and full frontal nudity but it's oh so much more in fact this is one of the <UNK> of cinematic poetry up there with some of the <UNK> works of 1930s art cinema in the same <UNK> group as under the <UNK> of paris <UNK> olympia and even <UNK> it's nearly a silent relying mostly on its <UNK> images and also its fantastic <UNK> score by <UNK> <UNK> it's a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting a good 90 of the film moves along perfectly <UNK> seems an expert at using <UNK> perhaps not as subtle as it could be and perhaps a bit <UNK> but the appearances of objects like insects lights and horses carry the story forward beautifully the small <UNK> of dialogue are thankfully <UNK> they don't jar as much as one would imagine the final bit is odd to say the least reminiscent of russian <UNK> we have a montage of workers this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative but it's so <UNK> done that i refuse to <UNK> too much on that flaw ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of <UNK> it belongs amongst the best films ever made
<START> rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters br br the <UNK> of <UNK> the minister <UNK> mother and the <UNK> down of the dynamic and important rivalry between <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> made the movie lack any real depth if you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why <UNK> loved the <UNK> and why <UNK> became her mentor at all br br visually the film was stunning and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given but that was all that was good about this movie
<START> i was expecting the movie based on grendel the book written by john <UNK> in the late 1970's it was based on the beowulf epic but told from the perspective of the monster br br whatever you may think of <UNK> book a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a <UNK> predator br br on top of this the writers should also be <UNK> for <UNK> up the original story so badly and <UNK> to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the us br br typical hollywood to get this so wrong br br very disappointing and a complete waste of time
<START> in his brief 40 years on earth author jack london managed to <UNK> as much adventure and incident as would seem possible this 90 minute film <UNK> a biography of the man's life but <UNK> <UNK> doesn't even scratch the surface and remains a story very <UNK> for a modern day retelling here michael <UNK> in one of his first roles portrays london and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic he is not the problem here nor is a young and very beautiful susan <UNK> playing his future wife <UNK> whose biography on london is the basis for this film <UNK> life has here been broken down into a series of episodes which the film <UNK> lightly through so we have brief incidents with london as an <UNK> pirate a <UNK> in the <UNK> sea a gold <UNK> in the <UNK> and a <UNK> during the russo japanese war colorful events for sure but hardly given anything like in depth treatment and alfred <UNK> direction he also directed one of <UNK> first films our leading citizen in 1939 is <UNK> at best making things <UNK> here is a very poor quality dvd with a crummy looking print source and <UNK> sound perhaps the best thing about this movie rental for me was one of the dvd's extras a <UNK> of all the <UNK> video films featuring hundreds and hundreds of full color movie posters let's just hope that these films are in better shape than jack london
<START> possible spoilers not sure br br while watching the lion king 1 1 2 i couldn't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did the story for those who haven't read the other reviews is about how timon and pumbaa meet and how they affect events in the original lion king br br there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie my favorite part is when they show the pair raising <UNK> however for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly <UNK> with the events of the original i can never look at the circle of life or can you feel the love tonight sequences the same way again i'm okay with the i just can't wait to be king sequence br br the voice talents are excellent nathan lane and ernie <UNK> do a wonderful job as do matthew <UNK> the guy who does <UNK> and the <UNK> even the actor who does young <UNK> sounded enough like <UNK> taylor thomas for me but why did they even include a voice actor for <UNK> he literally had only 2 lines and neither were very necessary the <UNK> of julie <UNK> and jerry stiller only add to the talent although you still can't hear <UNK> mom's voice and not think of <UNK> simpson br br there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the <UNK> br br as for the dvd itself you can't help but feel that for a 2 disc set the special features are especially lacking they could have easily fit a commentary or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc i enjoyed the who wants to be king of the jungle game even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i've ever seen some of the questions are actually difficult br br overall a good movie though not nearly as good as <UNK> or even <UNK>
<START> rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly <UNK> dunne <UNK> arquette <UNK> douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john <UNK> all jumped on board only to be <UNK> by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke <UNK> martin <UNK> name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull <UNK>
<START> first i realize that a 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out it's not bad in a self aware over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely <UNK> the continuity is so deliberate it's painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mock shock of what's her name see i don't even remember her character's name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things <UNK> <UNK> gone flying cars crashing into each other <UNK> going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh that's right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the <UNK> with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there hmmm br br it's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money you'd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now there's a novel idea br br my suggestion don't see this film don't rent the dvd don't watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied
<START> hidden <UNK> is more than fan fiction it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of star trek alive and growing from a fun little fan project to now a well known net series hidden <UNK> has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it set in the late star trek next generation <UNK> and voyager time lines hidden frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other star trek series with set stories using a well developed characters plots and story <UNK> star trek hidden frontier has taken on social context stories that gene <UNK> failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space <UNK> the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting <UNK> wars and conflicts sci fi <UNK> know and love done in a green screen studio hidden <UNK> brings a <UNK> cast of <UNK> on to the screen and into your hearts the large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project inventive use of green screen technology props makes up and costumes work to make the hidden frontier worlds of star trek fun and believable hidden frontier has gone where few <UNK> to go in the world of science fiction and <UNK> once they got there hidden frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website with interesting discussion <UNK> access to creative production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat i highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch
<START> i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the 2 for 1 rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it anyway br br i must say that i didn't like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an <UNK> for religion than anything else i found that the director's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in <UNK> order br br i won't throw it away like one of the other <UNK> but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie again br br who knows since it was michael <UNK> film debut maybe it might have some <UNK> value at some future date
<START> what could be more <UNK> than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be <UNK> on and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal br br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is wonderful each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long br br i showed this to several friends in the mid 80s because i was <UNK> at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie the friends enjoyed it too
<START> i am very sorry to say this but thunderbirds does not even come up with a loud pop never mind any thunder at one stage i gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema i stayed in the <UNK> hope that the film might improve i was to be disappointed it did not get any better it got worse if that is at all possible had i gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a spoof i would still have been let down they had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here they have totally wasted that opportunity bill paxton and sir ben kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and jonathan <UNK> well what can i say he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth i saw this film at a pre release showing i had been waiting to see it most eagerly having grown up in the sixties with the original shows to say i was disappointed would be something of an understatement one final thing i will say about the film was the puppets in the tv shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film
<START> director fred <UNK> <UNK> directs this well <UNK> but inferior comedy about albert einstein matthau trying to hook his scientific niece ryan up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's to get ryan to like robbins einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist the idea is cute but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue tim robbins meg ryan and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy <UNK> but are unable to rescue the film its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan
<START> this is superb the acting wonderful sets clothes music but most of all the story itself br br i am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie certainly one of the best of the 1980s br br it's also a wonderful movie to see in <UNK> with the great random <UNK> which has much the same opening crisis br br a middle aged unknown english w w i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war suffering from shell shock and complete <UNK> without any idea of his name origin or anywhere he belongs he proves to be a very wealthy established man when he <UNK> he will not remember the years before the war br br but there the <UNK> <UNK> end br br my <UNK> thanks to all who <UNK> in the movie particularly the actors ian <UNK> alan bates ann <UNK> what a great and surprising casting choice glenda jackson julie christie br br this one stays with you forever
<START> kudos to the patience of paul muni who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of <UNK> muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and i wonder how many people today other than classic movie buffs know anything about it he was a giant in the business for at least a decade he could have won the academy award for this performance which would have given him two in a row as he won it for playing louis <UNK> the year before my own opinion is that while he tended to <UNK> a bit i still think he was one of the great actors of the golden age whatever part he played you were <UNK> to the screen watching him br br unlike the <UNK> role i thought this story <UNK> of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years going overboard to make a liberal hero even in <UNK> hollywood couldn't <UNK> its disdain for police or for the military here making it a point to tell us how corrupt those <UNK> are filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated in that regard this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big time since the 1960s br br however it must be noted the facts support this story it also does not in any way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a social <UNK> getting rid of certain <UNK> good for him i wish they had spent more time showing that than <UNK> on one trial
<START> my wife and i really had high hopes for this film but it was a major disappointment it was a native american version of mr <UNK> a pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e g fishing hunting in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies his visions are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things words cannot express how bad this film is the children and wife are very real which makes the film even <UNK> i don't get the humor unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves i don't get how this could have come up for awards save your bucks it's not worth the rental
<START> best stephen king film alongside it though this one is more fun than scary br br this one's got it all br br a great cast with a alice <UNK> and brian <UNK> and a fun cameo from king himself br br well <UNK> horror in an amusing storyline br br great use of music <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in particular br br likeable characters in a typical king setting middle of nowhere village br br lots of humor you can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top br br old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore br br a 4 5 rating i don't get it really when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one
<START> imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about the grudge so in good faith you recommend seeing that movie it is the halloween season after all and it did <UNK> box office this past weekend so it must be pretty good so you go br br and you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does and you hear yourself <UNK> saying that can't be the end of the movie but alas it is br br and imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for <UNK> such a dog of a movie you think that your date thinks you're a <UNK> for suggesting such an atrocity and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship actually it was so bad that both of us <UNK> up laughing at how bad it was i see no future for miss <UNK> in the movies and suggest that she sticks to television in the future actually it won't be long before she is <UNK> to flea market conventions selling buffy <UNK> and it can't happen soon enough if you ask me horrible horrible horrible the plot didn't make sense continuity was terrible it's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a grudge ii the return of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all night horror movie marathon however as the night goes on there's somebody among them killing them off one by one who is it and why i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 i was looking forward to it but boy it did not work at all the premise is a good one they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like dee wallace stone on board but it doesn't work the story stops making sense halfway through that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released the killings are relatively <UNK> how this got an r rating is beyond me and the <UNK> of the killer at the end was boring and stupid br br it's really too bad this movie had potential with a better script this could have become a great horror film as it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it i heard stone won't talk about this one i give it a 3 and that's just for the cast
<START> i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue long drawn out far away stares and <UNK> and hack editing then you're spot on br br complicated story line hardly try juvenile and amateurish exquisite <UNK> and haunting memories hardly try flat out boring and trite br br this was awful i could not wait for it to be over particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of how are you i'm fine are you sure yes wow what depth of character i guess the <UNK> cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them br br as a huge fan of many chinese japanese and korean films i was totally disappointed in this even <UNK> <UNK> sappy the road home was better than this
<START> i first watched this film when i was a kid and is the only time in my life that i can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene i remembered it again with a <UNK> with my <UNK> friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of <UNK> i might add to my surprise i only found it on the web in the states when it was made in england when i watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too this is in my <UNK> the scariest film ever made hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit <UNK> and trap crap <UNK> the pun what is amazing though is the power of this film and at <UNK> when watching this with about twenty of my associates i have never heard so many screams <UNK> as well even the sight of the video brings the fear of god into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that i will never walk alone again in the dark
<START> man i really find it hard to believe that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess having seen the first two episodes thus far i think i can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list it's just got so many things working against it br br none of the actors cast are particularly good anna <UNK> as the lead character <UNK> is just awful i remember her being better in a lot of other things i've seen her in so maybe it's just the writing she's not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly the actor who plays bill is <UNK> better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and <UNK> the other actors do their best but with the cliché characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job tara is an absolute misery to watch <UNK> wesley absolutely murders the accent it's like nails on a <UNK> bad almost as awful is <UNK> <UNK> it's difficult to understand what he's even saying sometimes both his character as well as <UNK> also seem a bit racist to me i don't know having a character say <UNK> on an hbo show that isn't the wire just seems a bit odd <UNK> out the cast so far are <UNK> <UNK> grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting i've seen in william <UNK> as the sheriff br br the story seems to be meandering towards it's destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested the romance stuff is very dark shadow <UNK> although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old dark shadows episodes times about ten at times it seemed so campy to me that i just have to assume it was intended to be but unlike a show such as buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not out of place with the <UNK> is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show i'm not <UNK> to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other hbo shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving jason <UNK> seem a bit over the top and pointless br br about the only nice thing i can really think to say about this mess is that i liked the opening title sequence hbo has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately i hope they <UNK> this after the first season and try to get something better on the air
<START> robert <UNK> was a fine actor and he makes this tv movie believable i remember watching this film when i was 15 and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same people lose who they were when enter this <UNK> club in a computer rich <UNK> town <UNK> <UNK> to figure out what is wrong with his family and i love the halloween space suit idea brilliant this film is about the battle of one's <UNK> tv quality that <UNK> the big budget gangs of new york i wonder if robert <UNK> was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie i hope so 6 or 7 out of 10
<START> this <UNK> quiet gem tells the true story of a <UNK> escape during <UNK> ii the performances are incredible especially anthony steele the movie works on many different levels cerebral emotional visual and literal the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true in fact an unusual all around authenticity puts this one head and shoulders above most war epics
<START> vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie <UNK> los <UNK> open your eyes and in my opinion a much more human and emotional version tom cruise plays david <UNK> a selfish <UNK> who takes other people's emotions for granted and thinks only of himself jason lee plays brian <UNK> david's best and in many ways only friend penelope <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend whom <UNK> him to david's birthday party cameron diaz plays julie <UNK> david's occasional bed buddy kurt russell plays dr curtis <UNK> a psychologist <UNK> david all of their interactions and the consequences of them make vanilla sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made i won't explain anymore of the plot because it's far more compelling the less you know ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow if you pay attention you won't be confused the film is very complex but not confusing and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made
<START> in contrast to my fellow reviewers i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see yes the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those <UNK> female lesbian vampires with blood dripping something must be lost in the translation of the word <UNK> from the italian in the title almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so tacked it onto the film anyway br br this film made in 1975 has recently been <UNK> on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect italian <UNK> from the mid 1970s i bought it because i am attracted to <UNK> <UNK> credited most often as <UNK> <UNK> the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these <UNK> films from the 60s 70s i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned i think <UNK> <UNK> played <UNK> but underneath that massive hair style costume and make up it is difficult to <UNK> her for sure br br there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out maybe something is lost in the dubbing process what were the positive points well the music was atmospheric and of course if you're into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there the <UNK> locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island it <UNK> to be set in ireland north or the republic in <UNK> so everyone sports period piece costumes some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes anyway an enjoyable romp i rated it 4 10
<START> i watched the <UNK> reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony <UNK> to see them now was wonderful because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited the only thing i could not figure out is why <UNK> reed <UNK> mccoy and michael <UNK> little luke was not on there i know that walter brennan had died so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to <UNK> reed <UNK> mccoy and michael <UNK> little luke i would be thankful i have searched <UNK> and no luck the only thing i could find out about michael <UNK> is he was supposed to be born in 1946 this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned the shows today dont have that the whole cast was <UNK> the only thing better than finding out <UNK> them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do thank you glenda
<START> whereas the hard boiled detective stories of <UNK> <UNK> and raymond chandler have <UNK> to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop indeed creating the <UNK> modern american genre and style in the process those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever the problem with books like those of agatha christie dorothy l <UNK> or s s van <UNK> on whose work this film is based is that they are low on action or variety whereas sam spade or philip <UNK> <UNK> the mean streets of la working class <UNK> bars <UNK> wealthy <UNK> and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence golden age fiction is generally fixed in location the scene of the murder usually a lavish country house and the action is limited to investigating clues and <UNK> suspects this is a very static <UNK> plot reduced to puzzle br br this of course is as much <UNK> as anything else the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement the hard boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre both of authority and of a city <UNK> itself up into hostile ever <UNK> and <UNK> camps another major problem with golden age fiction is character because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end we cannot gain access to characters' motivations or emotions being defined solely by their potential need to murder the detective unlike the anxious prejudice ridden private eyes are simply there to be brilliant and maybe a little eccentric br br the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> jane austen school and end up looking silly there have been <UNK> for example the radical <UNK> of <UNK> queen and others by claude <UNK> in the english speaking world there have really only been two the <UNK> <UNK> classic <UNK> for <UNK> works because it pushes the form almost into parody while never <UNK> the integrity or interest of the mystery br br before that came michael <UNK> brilliant 'the <UNK> murder <UNK> the narrative is pure golden age a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him he is <UNK> murdered in a seemingly <UNK> manner <UNK> suicide <UNK> in a locked room the <UNK> policemen fall hopelessly for the bait it is up to philo vance gentleman and amateur detective neither old nor fat to read the clues more <UNK> open the case out of the confines of the room and eventually solve the case the corpse being little more than the <UNK> for intellectual <UNK> br br what is interesting is not this detective plot which can only ever be unsatisfying as all <UNK> are although it is rarely less than entertaining and full of comical bits of business there isn't even really an attempt to <UNK> the image of the perfect detective there is one <UNK> scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect with no protest from vance but that's about it br br what marks <UNK> as a classic is its <UNK> <UNK> is not generally considered a great auteur because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development but he was hollywood's greatest <UNK> and he is on sensational form here if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle <UNK> takes this idea to is logical extreme creating an abstract variation on his source <UNK> narrative character and location to <UNK> a series of lines from the beautiful art <UNK> sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition and as they <UNK> <UNK> at an angle <UNK> the dead <UNK> to life br br this treatment is appropriate to a story that <UNK> refuses realism it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors like the two central brothers or the original crime itself borrowed from an <UNK> <UNK> book this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental <UNK> shades of 'the <UNK> <UNK> chinese servants ex cons turned <UNK> dog loving <UNK> <UNK> cops is the perfect <UNK> for vance a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a <UNK> <UNK> who knows the social world of these people and yet is <UNK> by his interest in crime and association with the police or would be if he wasn't anything more than a thinking machine william powell the greatest american comedian of the decade <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> humanity br br but if the treatment is <UNK> the climax is spectacularly brutal involving vicious dogs and attempted murder the police and the detective supposed to be <UNK> crime are guilty of <UNK> one
<START> my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up <UNK> and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who <UNK> seen the tv series but it <UNK> the fans too the last five minutes <UNK> another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite <UNK> <UNK> cox this is a good film
<START> germans think <UNK> is funny just like americans think <UNK> is sexy and that women with english accents are acting i had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close up of a <UNK> face one of those <UNK> <UNK> corporate <UNK> tales where she <UNK> a bank by <UNK> a few random keys on her home pc which is connected only to a power <UNK> the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady can't say i share his feelings there's quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television <UNK> <UNK> along with the <UNK> apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is
<START> this place in england during 1940 three <UNK> carrie charles and paul are sent to live with miss price angela lansbury she doesn't want them but reluctantly takes them in it seems she is studying to be a witch through a <UNK> course with the college of witchcraft ok i realize this is a family film but college of witchcraft come on before she can finish the course though the college is closed because of the war and she seeks down the head professor <UNK> david <UNK> and her and the kids travel around on a bed with the help of a magical <UNK> br br i first saw this when i was 9 and vaguely remember loving it it sure doesn't hold up as an adult the story is silly even for a fantasy the kids are terrible actors and one of them charles is incredibly obnoxious also <UNK> <UNK> is third billed and only appears in two short scenes there's also a trip to the <UNK> of <UNK> which is run by animated animals i thought that might be fun but the animation is poor for disney and it has a very violent and far too long soccer game between the animals there are a few saving <UNK> here lansbury and <UNK> are just great the songs while forgettable are pleasant the long dance sequence on <UNK> road is very colorful and full of energy and the oscar winning special effects are still pretty impressive at the end but the weak story line poor animation and unlikable kids really pull this one down i heard the extended version is even worse i can only give this a 7
<START> this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the end and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a <UNK> of love <UNK> lawrence who is best known as a <UNK> really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being self centered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a <UNK> the scenery breath taking and the message of love genuine
<START> well i'm probably about to be <UNK> by everyone on this site but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i've seen in a long time we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of <UNK> and <UNK> they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind conveniently they happen to find a bag of <UNK> and at the same time they find out that the <UNK> has ended yeah ok with this knowledge they return home with their <UNK> and everything is fine and wonderful again br br well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film however the film then continues on for a whole other hour and in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the <UNK> of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers oh <UNK> and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah just because you know your making an epic film doesn't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn't even cared about through most of the film br br oh wait and the film isn't the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesn't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again br br there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography the land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the <UNK> is quite impressive too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say br br one last thing i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface also a better film than this of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian the rest are just americans being silly oh and please ms rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands oh i would br br the good earth is one epic waste of time if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the <UNK> of wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets mainly because it wasn't written by a monkey

<START> this apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking but feeding the masses comes off lame as some of the stiff <UNK> zombies stalking the streets in <UNK> island a zombie <UNK> known as the <UNK> virus is being played down by the government manipulated <UNK> and television stations a couple of brave but dumb souls at channel 5 tv news feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand an eager reporter <UNK> morris and her cameraman william <UNK> with the aid of a military <UNK> patrick cohen risk life and <UNK> to present a <UNK> broadcast to show the doom at hand do yourself a favor and don't watch this thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad acting is atrocious and the flesh hungry zombies are almost comical also appearing are michael <UNK> william <UNK> and brenda hogan feeding the masses should be left to <UNK>
<START> little <UNK> is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen they have a way of producing the <UNK> comedy programming they can for the oldest most easily offended viewers which for cbc means 85 year old <UNK> in <UNK> the jokes are all predictable and so <UNK> lame i can't believe it the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and <UNK> very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes royal canadian air farce and rick <UNK> report
<START> i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions <UNK> greatly i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great or i wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day i like supporting indie cinema especially if they are gay themed but this movie is almost too much to tolerate those that walked out as i considered doing after about three minutes probably didn't mind <UNK> out 11 00 or just figured it was going nowhere fast and not going to improve maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place br br logan is bored he's a <UNK> he's gay i'm okay with that the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of <UNK> re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene and the second scene etc etc nothing or no one goes anywhere no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting probably most appalling of all is that i didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan that in itself is a major accomplishment he didn't grow he didn't change he didn't learn there is no one to teach him anything he didn't do anything and neither did the movie scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make br br additionally the title makes no sense at all 1 10

<START> this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians felix <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today and this film really puts that on display br br <UNK> <UNK> adult people is a warm hearted and hilarious story about <UNK> and the question if we <UNK> be better off without it
<START> there are people claiming this is another bad language ultra violence mexican movie they are right but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become the awful truth hurts or <UNK> when you already have accepted the <UNK> of living the third world as the only possible goal one of the most important things of <UNK> y van <UNK> is the open <UNK> to profound <UNK> over our current identity is that what we all are is that all that we want to be i am abroad and i realized how spoiled is the mexican society when the <UNK> incident came to light i still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass <UNK> murder i nearly <UNK> when i saw some of the images it was not <UNK> or <UNK> just a tiny village near mexico city when rampage was carried out with the <UNK> of media and government the recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply the other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption <UNK> betrayal and violence but i consider <UNK> de <UNK> the best one br br the movie is deeper than some <UNK> and <UNK> screams those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people with a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country moreover honesty is only rewarded miraculously
<START> within 15 minutes my whole family was rooting for goldie <UNK> character to die or at least for steve <UNK> character to leave her at 40 minutes we turned it off there are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can't even stomach it long enough for the story to get established br br normally i like both steve martin and goldie hawn and i remember enjoying the neil simon original so i blame marc lawrence and sam <UNK> combine the director of whats the worst that can happen and the writer of miss <UNK> 2 and i guess this is what we end up with
<START> in this installment of the series edmund <UNK> is stuck in the <UNK> period in britain during the later portion of george <UNK> rule this time <UNK> <UNK> are much <UNK> as instead of <UNK> he's a servant to the very very thick george iv the price <UNK> unlike the historical accounts of george iv this one is about as bright as a <UNK> and as a result <UNK> able to take advantage of him and scheme to his <UNK> content the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very very very different note you just have to see it to believe it other than that all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious the only <UNK> i have as always is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations
<START> michael caine has always claimed that <UNK> was the only film he did purely for the money as well as the worst film he ever starred in hold on michael weren't you in the <UNK> and hurry <UNK> and weren't both of those films a good deal worse than <UNK> perhaps caine remembers only too <UNK> the physically <UNK> demands of filming an action film in <UNK> <UNK> degrees <UNK> <UNK> the director richard <UNK> was <UNK> as a result of sun stroke during the shoot what <UNK> actually emerges as is not the career low point of michael caine instead it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast exotic locations boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline br br dr david <UNK> caine is a w h o <UNK> who is left <UNK> when his black wife <UNK> beverly johnson goes missing during an aid trip to an african <UNK> village <UNK> gradually realises that his wife has been <UNK> by slave <UNK> led by <UNK> peter ustinov and he sets off on a continent wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east br br along the way big stars pop in for <UNK> and superfluous guest roles william <UNK> has a poor cameo as a <UNK> pilot omar <UNK> displays little of his <UNK> charm or grace as a <UNK> arab millionaire rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who <UNK> caine in his quest the film is based on a best <UNK> entitled <UNK> by the little known author <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation ustinov is charismatic as the <UNK> he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances and caine <UNK> believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again there are occasional flashes of action but on the whole <UNK> is quite slow moving all in all it is a <UNK> piece of action <UNK> not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let down from all the talent involved
<START> what about <UNK> childhood the double <UNK> operation which is believed to have <UNK> off his obsession with the inner <UNK> of the human body what about <UNK> land the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being <UNK> when they came too close to one another suggesting that <UNK> was the ultimate danger what about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father his feelings of neglect when his brother was born what about his fascination with insects and animals how he would <UNK> <UNK> and hang it up in the woods behind his home what about focusing more on his <UNK> and what about his <UNK> divorce these are all things that should have been included in the film instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down <UNK> from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer br br why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people he could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club instead he just shows him <UNK> away at them from behind br br whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can <UNK> into 90 minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film <UNK> his relationship with luis <UNK> known as rodney in this film my only guess is that the director was trying to build up <UNK> character to try and make us fear for or <UNK> with him but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasn't the scene in which he kills steven <UNK> his first victim is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing or that he didn't kill again for nine years we assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when and why br br what about the <UNK> he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations br br some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit <UNK> but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that <UNK> br br finally a film with subject matter as <UNK> as this should carry an 18 <UNK> not a 15 we needed to see his <UNK> in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us that doesn't mean showing the <UNK> actually entering <UNK> <UNK> head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his <UNK> <UNK> was when actually killing anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people he actually killed <UNK> men br br aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isn't all bad there is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place
<START> i really hate this retarded show it sucks big time and personally i think it is insulting to fairy kind if you believe in <UNK> that is i mean the people who had come up with such crap <UNK> to have their heads examine huh and also there is a lot of <UNK> the evil school teacher which i think is getting really old and also stupidity the boy's parents and fairy godfather in this show two of the things that i <UNK> and <UNK> in the whole world especially stupidity br br overall i say that this show is so f ' annoying and should not be seen by <UNK> eyes at all it would <UNK> bleed to death
<START> this movie is humorous charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons so i simply accept it as is bing in his usual <UNK> style performs quite well as the <UNK> hank martin who by accident is transported back to another age the time of king arthur the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> is breathtaking as <UNK> or sandy the object of <UNK> affections although she is <UNK> to the brave and <UNK> sir <UNK> played by henry <UNK> br br i just love that episode when king arthur cedric <UNK> sir <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hank bing crosby dress up in <UNK> clothing and take to the high road with their <UNK> to experience the kingdom at <UNK> king <UNK> comment i say we are not alone while giving his <UNK> <UNK> a good scratch is one of those hilarious moments in the film william <UNK> portrayal is superbly ridiculous not to mention his attempts at quaint <UNK> <UNK> english br br the story is not deep but it's well done in my opinion and i enjoy it more each time i see it it's great family entertainment too br br
<START> when john wayne filmed his <UNK> story he had built a complete <UNK> set in the town of <UNK> texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction as long as that stands we will have a set for future <UNK> interpretations for the screen one such with dennis quaid and billy bob <UNK> was done in this century br br but i would say the <UNK> thirteen days to glory is the best <UNK> story filmed i've seen john wayne's film is a good one if over hyped but it's a john wayne film with the story <UNK> to fill <UNK> of screen character of john wayne brian keith plays <UNK> <UNK> here and gives a fine interpretation of the <UNK> frontier character he was br br it's a lot closer to professor <UNK> <UNK> book on the <UNK> than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can <UNK> to that <UNK> book is listed as the source in both films but <UNK> who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result br br alec baldwin was around the right age for young william <UNK> travis the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner back in the day no one saw the ironic <UNK> in that one thing that was not explored and hasn't been was <UNK> <UNK> sex drive he was the <UNK> of the <UNK> he even kept a <UNK> diary of his <UNK> <UNK> br br but the man who always gets the <UNK> is jim <UNK> played here by james <UNK> he was a hero at the <UNK> to be sure but his career before the <UNK> was that of a <UNK> he was a <UNK> a slave <UNK> an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to but his heroic death certainly redeemed him no hint of that is in <UNK> portrayal nor any others i've seen of <UNK> on the screen and of course he did design the <UNK> knife done to his <UNK> that man needed such a weapon br br however the main asset that the <UNK> thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion <UNK> up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican <UNK> unfortunately those americans came with some pre conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south at least liberty for white people <UNK> julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history he was also quite the <UNK> but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> came along br br this film was the farewell performance of <UNK> greene who appears briefly as general sam <UNK> <UNK> not quite my conception of <UNK> he really was way too old for the part <UNK> was in his early forties in <UNK> he was not yet the <UNK> of texas but within the limits <UNK> on him greene does a fine job br br for a romantic telling of the <UNK> tale by all means see john wayne's version but for historical content i recommend this film highly
<START> this movie i won't call it a film was basically about nothing and <UNK> mostly for the popular acts of the time yeah the war was on full swing pun intended and this movie gave the troops and our audiences a treat br br but let's have something with a bit more substance br br loved seeing a young buddy rich on the drums the music was good throughout br br but one cameo after another gets old fast br br i didn't even recognize zero mostel so if you're one from the greatest generation as they say you'll definitely enjoy this br br movie
<START> a linear travel within a non linear structure it's a fact that time in 12 monkeys flows in this come and go between present future and past however the movie's <UNK> can't be avoided it's the very work of the <UNK> the unfolding of the narrative br br what we can see underlying the <UNK> theme is a reflection on the <UNK> of our actions the world of this terry gilliam film is a world with little space for free will br br right from the beginning we are informed about a <UNK> prophecy according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997 forcing the few survivors to live underground the only place not affected by the virus br br <UNK> willis mission is clear return to the mid 90's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus there's no way to change the past all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present that for us viewers is the future find the cure not to change what happened the past is inevitable but make the present better br br in his returns in time cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma his life in the past is better than his life in the present br br the latter is dark and <UNK> controlled by <UNK> scientists that <UNK> <UNK> this word is <UNK> ironic to <UNK> on the <UNK> to the past br br the scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel and cole ends up on wrong dates this will later in the plot work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist kathryn <UNK> br br we can see through the evolution of the story that <UNK> and non <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> br br there is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last and certainly the climactic appears it <UNK> itself according to the <UNK> of <UNK> memories that come up in his dreams br br in an airport a man is shot dead while running armed toward someone else a blonde woman runs after the murdered one br br this is the scene that <UNK> the past in which cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents the present the time of the narrative and the future adult cole throughout the narrative cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now his <UNK> dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened the agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist doctor peters morse that is the responsible for the <UNK> of the disease br br what was can't be changed and in <UNK> case what was is what will be <UNK> br br a film not quite well understood for many to me nothing less than a masterpiece br br other good movies with similar theme the back to the future trilogy that has another angle regarding the mad scientist character and although it shares the atmosphere of <UNK> particularly in the second film it is way more optimistic than <UNK> work that is an odd hollywood picture br br in another register there is wild <UNK> one of <UNK> masterpieces that involves a striking and <UNK> travel to the past through dreams and <UNK> br br i've never watched la <UNK> but only because i can't find it
<START> beating the bad guys again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about it br br home alone one and two film classics home alone three and four a good film if you're three like <UNK> and <UNK> as hard as it tries to be funny it's not culkin is replaced by alex <UNK> or something else he's a very bland actor with bland performances but it's not entirely his fault the writing called for bland <UNK> and bland expressions the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken <UNK> are real a good choice if you are a <UNK> teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day and to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you don't believe me but you'll regret it
<START> pixar has had massive success over the years with the full length cgi animated movies they have made a bug's life was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far <UNK> by the <UNK> feature length debut the groundbreaking toy story which was the first ever feature length cgi movie i remember when this follow up was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990's but i never actually saw it until november 2006 i watched it twice that month and over three years later i have seen it a third time it has never impressed me as much as probably any other pixar film i've ever seen but after three viewings i still think it's better than some of the films i've seen from <UNK> animation br br <UNK> island is the home of a colony of ants these ants are forced to gather food for a gang of <UNK> who come and take it every year one member of this colony is <UNK> an <UNK> with a bad reputation for causing trouble with his <UNK> even though he doesn't mean to one year when the colony has just finished preparing the <UNK> offering <UNK> accidentally knocks it into a stream just before the <UNK> arrive to get it the <UNK> leader hopper decides to give them a second chance to gather food and have it ready by the end of the season but they will have to double their offering <UNK> suggests to the <UNK> royal <UNK> that he goes and finds warrior bugs to fight off the <UNK> when they come back princess <UNK> the future queen lets him go on this mission just so he won't be around to cause trouble while the colony tries to gather food for another offering the <UNK> finds a group of bugs which he thinks are warriors but after he takes them back to <UNK> island and introduces them he learns that they are actually not warriors but circus bugs br br the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely <UNK> me might be the characters to me none of them have ever really stood out as much as they could have and generally seem a bit bland fortunately however it's not like shark tale a film with a very idiotic and unlikable lead character a bug's life does have a likable enough main character one which viewers can root for the story also seems somewhat bland at times but for the most part it's good enough to keep the film at least moderately entertaining and sometimes has some good suspense especially later on the humour like certain other aspects of the film isn't as good as it could have been but there are definitely funny moments some of them involving francis a male <UNK> who is sometimes mistaken for a female you can always expect great animation from pixar and the animation in this particular effort of theirs is no exception with all this movie has to offer it may be slightly disappointing when it comes to pixar standards but it is reasonable family entertainment
<START> the blob is a classic 1950s b movie sci fi flick you probably know the story two teens steve mcqueen <UNK> <UNK> see a <UNK> hit the ground and when they go to look for it they run into an old man with some weird blob attached to his arm they take him to the doctor's office and then go to find out what happened from there the blob <UNK> eating everyone in its path the special effects are cheesy fun as is the story there are a lot of great touches like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district it's no masterpiece but it has a special place in its genre steve mcqueen is very good 8 10
<START> a young and seemingly promising college graduate played by blair <UNK> is sent to jail for the murder of an innocent young girl and is put on death row sean connery plays the happy go lucky attorney whom the young man's grandmother tracks down out of retirement and <UNK> with to take on the case in the hopes of <UNK> her <UNK> laurence fishburne plays a police officer who was well involved in the case and is hell bent on <UNK> an theory that connery might dig up to try and free the boy whom he and the entire police department swear is guilty of the crime ed harris kate <UNK> ruby dee and the late <UNK> <UNK> co star in this very intense dramatic thriller
<START> the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time stunningly shot with lighting effects that are truly sublime this is an early gem that clearly reveals <UNK> barker to be a <UNK> director of equal standing to d w griffith and maurice <UNK> how much control thomas <UNK> <UNK> over the production is hard to know but this film still has extraordinary power the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york is very moving the themes of social injustice revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today the use of close ups is outstanding and the <UNK> performance of george <UNK> is <UNK> what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema
<START> one is tempted to define the genre of <UNK> de <UNK> movie as event of the <UNK> following the example of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> storyline is a certain bart <UNK> <UNK> quest for that <UNK> substance which <UNK> the essence of personality the script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination this film monologue <UNK> as a response to <UNK> 8 <UNK> and cost <UNK> de <UNK> 13 years of work <UNK> playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience it reveals the whimsical <UNK> of the real and imaginary the <UNK> co existence in two different <UNK> that of <UNK> and that of <UNK> for some time we are apt to side with the script writer who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality man' <UNK> window <UNK> and together with him we fall into a trap when the author creator is finally faced with the <UNK> dilemma how can one eliminate from the future movie bart <UNK> just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty <UNK> of the wife of the creator who is deeply immersed in work we realize that together with the main character we have again been <UNK> really what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to <UNK> one's own name and the day to day care for the young daughter br br so who is he this bart <UNK> is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like <UNK> from <UNK> masterpiece just like the latter the script writer in the end <UNK> from the computer memory everything has written <UNK> de <UNK> suggests that we answer this question ourselves br br
<START> my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes the characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing the story is made up of mini plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan br br
<START> this is the 2nd time i've seen this movie in about 12 years these remarks come from someone who finds kane and <UNK> to be amazing worthy films but the remainder of welles career is unfortunately <UNK> on material <UNK> of his talent and too flimsy to <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and when he makes a <UNK> like shanghai the lack of anything substantial to hang his <UNK> tricks on is just kind of sad i couldn't tell you what he was exploring here it's all as mannered as <UNK> <UNK> irish <UNK> which takes a lot of effort but adds absolutely zero to the film several welles projects became this <UNK> and <UNK> mr <UNK> pick a version any version is a similarly <UNK> project the material is <UNK> it just can't bear the weight of all this <UNK> for a director <UNK> in reality based drama as here he never feels any pull to tie his <UNK> of <UNK> back to reality or to a coherent story the murder for hire scheme is ridiculous br br kudos to welles though for having hayworth cut her hair and getting that performance out of her the camera loves her she's the <UNK> most <UNK> <UNK> and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film but her <UNK> comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision made so the movie will have some genre it fits into the movie can't be saved by a noir convention <UNK> in the last 60 seconds br br when all is said and done in l f s the <UNK> are all for what to convince you you've seen something thoughtful to give welles more to do to make you roll your eyes welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story or to telling a story directly one wonders what shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> cross murder for hire scheme or a <UNK> in love with <UNK> <UNK> devoid of meaning or substance br br overwrought preposterous <UNK>
<START> this has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy i've ever seen in my life ben stiller jack black and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can't make me laugh <UNK> got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie i've ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can <UNK> say that the only movie i've ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead the only worse movie i laughed very slightly at the merry go round scene and that's it spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right i don't know i guess the filmmakers thought that <UNK> was a funny word or something and the other running joke really is beating a dead horse literally
<START> once upon a time there were different types of movies these different movies <UNK> even though each one had something different to offer br br this seems obvious at first but i thought i'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten this is just a fun movie for pavarotti fans that's all it is it doesn't claim to be anything else or anything <UNK> people who <UNK> it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture literally after all hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people bodyguard or the <UNK> wife w <UNK> <UNK> are 2 examples that spring to mind br br first i'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for pavarotti there are worse things in this world and worse movies the singing is fabulous and the selection of <UNK> is fun the movie starts with <UNK> <UNK> maria and then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sings <UNK> from la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but also sings popular music such as i left my heart in san francisco and the song that was nominated for an oscar golden globe if we were in love w music by john williams lyrics by alan marilyn bergman all 3 previous oscar winners br br the story isn't that bad it was built for pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally <UNK> to the average movie viewer it's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago when asked to sing again at the same place the met in nyc he loses his voice from fear doctor pamela or <UNK> may <UNK> in italian played by kathryn <UNK> gives him a shot to cure his <UNK> reaction he offers her the chance to have a <UNK> with him and she reluctantly accepts br br they <UNK> on an affair she knowing he's married promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman despite all that they fall in love thus the song if we were in love and with her help he <UNK> his fear goes back to the met where he <UNK> i won't tell how it ends but it's fairly predictable which isn't always a bad thing br br the performances in this aren't that bad pavarotti who plays <UNK> <UNK> isn't an actor so if you're expecting a spencer tracy or tom hanks performance you are <UNK> not pavarotti he knows he's not a <UNK> what he is is cute charming charismatic he is having fun himself and if you can just let yourself have fun too it's not so bad one funny line is when he tells pamela <UNK> that she's a <UNK> plant <UNK> can water you and of course she says i don't want to be watered on by <UNK> kathryn <UNK> is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi uptight woman who learns from this <UNK> man to live a little one of my favorite lines in the movie is life never has to be life size and there's eddie albert who does his usual good job as <UNK> manager there are several themselves cameos by real <UNK> singers etc and it is filmed on location at the <UNK> opera at lincoln center br br if you like opera if you like pavarotti or if you can just let yourself go enjoy a little <UNK> just like he <UNK> in the movie then you can enjoy this movie for what it is i know i do every time br br
<START> i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an <UNK> nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic <UNK> in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasn't a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen i can't wait to see where she ends up she's showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that it's all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for <UNK> it on dvd
<START> i just finished dark chamber aka under <UNK> and i'm stunned stunned not by the film but by some of the rave reviews i <UNK> which influenced my watching it the story was so <UNK> by plot holes and the majority of the acting so flat <UNK> it as a comedy seems appropriate seriously i found myself shaking my head and laughing in <UNK> as i endured this movie br br justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's <UNK> that dad is no good when a young woman is found murdered justin becomes suspicious of the <UNK> who <UNK> in the <UNK> apartments with the help of a couple pals he <UNK> <UNK> cameras to keep <UNK> on these folks as the truth begins to unravel justin <UNK> an unexpected secret br br one positive point is that <UNK> rose is hot i would have <UNK> slapped an extra star or two on here had she <UNK> down a bit but no such luck it would have been the film's potential saving grace eric <UNK> played justin very <UNK> i thought and i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future br br the general premise of the film although plagued by clichés might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members most notably alexandra <UNK> <UNK> and david h <UNK> <UNK> father the horror <UNK> the pun br br i have nothing against low budget films indeed i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come i'll cut low budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects lighting even musical score and the overall picture quality i don't give <UNK> however for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese <UNK> script there are a vast number of competently made low budget films out there sadly this isn't one of them i can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way <UNK> with its production
<START> it's very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece this opinion is <UNK> for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that <UNK> <UNK> b c they <UNK> perfectly the characters a second reason is that the poetry expressed by <UNK> in his poem is well given by the production among others the <UNK> made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition third reason the <UNK> of the <UNK> is absolutely perfect in <UNK> <UNK> where the action of the poem occurred and most of all the emotion is on the <UNK> i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
<START> the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films it also seems a lot more <UNK> charged than i remember the other films being if you're a big fan of flying <UNK> hair and <UNK> that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film
<START> indian summer is a good film it made me feel good and i thought the cast was exceptional how about sam <UNK> playing the camp <UNK> i thought his scenes were very funny in a buster keaton like performance solid directing and nice cinematography
<START> i watched this immediately after seeing <UNK> cannibals so anything would have been an improvement on top of that it stops me from comparing zombi 3 to 28 days later and its sequel unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised how well made danny <UNK> original was and how much this movie influenced 28 weeks later br br one can't help <UNK> how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of italian horror movie i was totally convinced zombi 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest in which case i would have called my summary 28 years later <UNK> but wasn't until i came to this page to find it was released in 1988 all the production values scream that it's a low budget splatter flick from the very early part of that decade i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old <UNK> in 1982 as would have my peers but not now br br much of the problem involves a lack of internal continuity for example some of the zombies <UNK> about with the pace of a <UNK> while others can run very fast and <UNK> self awareness which leads to a ridiculous end scene involving a dj likewise some can be killed by a kick to the face while others remain alive even if they've had their head chopped off wait till you see the <UNK> scene you might just die laughing even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been <UNK> him to drive <UNK> for a career br br obviously you're reminded of the earlier film the <UNK> which also reminded me of the later 28 films bunch of terrorists break in to scientific base leading to all sorts of disaster with the military being the bad guys trying to kill both the infected and the survivors and long before the ending you'll have worked out that basically everyone dies the problem with this is you'll instantly be reminded of how the british franchise did it so much better on a bigger budget not just that but the 28 franchise will appeal to a thinking audience who may have little interest in the average horror movie zombi 3 will appeal to no one but a hardcore splatter audience
<START> sometimes realism can work against the <UNK> of a film that's no problem here the sets are cheesy inside and out the fog is <UNK> half <UNK> the <UNK> of the production if there's a bar the name painted on the front window says simply wine and spirits the result is a claustrophobic set of scenes not a single shot of a city or even a fake <UNK> that's the kind of <UNK> this story is about just as jack the <UNK> movies are about seedy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who would want it any other way how could it have been any other way with no <UNK> stars a <UNK> budget and a four week shooting schedule the acting follows suit outrageously hammy on everyone's part sometimes my god it's positively excruciating mrs <UNK> <UNK> after frankie is shot dead outside the house victor <UNK> however delivers exactly the right kind of overdone performance wardrobe has stuffed him into a too small jacket so that he seems to be <UNK> out of it like <UNK> monster his every movement seems to go a little <UNK> than it was intended to when he <UNK> his cap on his head he <UNK> himself on the temple a big <UNK> <UNK> baby he seems constantly drunk he betrays his best friend for the reward money which will take him and his would be girl to america not a good guy in the ordinary sense yet we <UNK> as he begins to spend the 20 pounds more and more of it during a wild alcoholic night because every expensive and <UNK> gesture takes him <UNK> from his dream i wouldn't argue it but i can understand why he won an oscar br br as for max <UNK> score wow every movement already overdone is not only <UNK> by the mickey mouse music but <UNK> in glossy yellow it shouldn't have happened the heavenly <UNK> the endearing young charms the <UNK> boy the <UNK> tune while mclaglen drinks from the bottle it would have been better off with no score at all br br well how is it as a whole dated by any measure but not a product of its times that's why i admire it yes the symbolism is clumsy at times mclaglen a real <UNK> <UNK> his head against a hanging sign the fog the blind man but what <UNK> me is how little of this was being tried at the time what strikes us as overly arty today was in 1936 something quite different from what was seen in most of the <UNK> being ground out at the time if it falls short at times it doesn't matter the movie was an act of courage politically and morally as well as <UNK> the legion of decency condemned it because of a scene in a <UNK> a director's goal should <UNK> his grasp or what's a script for watching it now however in 2006 the story is more disturbing than ever john ford obviously <UNK> with the irish rebels they kill but only out of what they see as necessity he knows too much to live what if he goes to the <UNK> oh it's not me self i'm thinking of but all of us of ireland herself the irish are <UNK> and sympathetic i wonder if the <UNK> in the middle east don't use a similar logic to justify their acts of violence
<START> i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will rational thinking the <UNK> of church state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke br br there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us <UNK> br br i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by <UNK> madness that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach christian principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world br br it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should <UNK> to the good old days of the 19th century
<START> it was just a terrible movie no one should waste their time go see something else this movie is without a doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life if you want to see a good movie don't see made men
<START> scary movie 3 is such a <UNK> its hard to put it in words it makes movies like <UNK> most wanted look like oscar material lets just say that br br the original scary movie was great fun one of the better 90s spoof movies coming from a great team who previously <UNK> our world with dont be a menace to south central whilst drinking your juice in the hood but what the hell happened after the tragedy that was scary movie 2 i thought the cast and crew change would help matters but its even worse br br within <UNK> i'd <UNK> twice not one laugh the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor the fact that at this point in writing the majority of people on this site have voted it 10 10 has made me feel physically ill when there's great flicks like school of rock out which actually have jokes that are gasp funny anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined br br no stars
<START> an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene <UNK> tony king was very realistic in his role of <UNK> this movie was one of the last <UNK> all black movies of the 70's and unlike the <UNK> movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by <UNK> franklin was popular on the r b <UNK> at the time
<START> i <UNK> this movie not only because i am a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> although he is in practically all german movies that count but also because he is not the main actor the lead is taken over by <UNK> <UNK> who was the only reason to watch <UNK> <UNK> and who really carries this movie on his shoulders br br a family moves from italy to germany seeking the german dream this is my own invention and ironic of cheap labor in steel and coal <UNK> however they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming from this point <UNK> the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother's determination to return to italy what follows is a great and totally neutral look at what life can become formed by the choices you make br br in the end this movie doesn't say which life <UNK> or <UNK> was more successful or fuller or more interesting it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and <UNK> are involved and this look is not driven by <UNK> or disdain to either country which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from <UNK> the fact that director <UNK> <UNK> moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy the <UNK> on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast especially <UNK> and this i really need to stress the little boy who plays young <UNK> that kid's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone great movie go see it
<START> though the title may suggest examples of the 10 <UNK> it is a definitely incorrect <UNK> this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> century <UNK> story collection br br set within a medieval italian town's largely <UNK> population it is a <UNK> on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in time br br given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the <UNK> of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic <UNK> rules br br nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or <UNK>
<START> after going for a bike ride that day lying beside a lake in a nature <UNK> spending half an hour feeding and talking to a <UNK> who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it this film made absolute sense to me br br the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need switch off the conscious control <UNK> of the mind and job done br br reminded me of <UNK> 1992 but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph br br this comment requires a minimum of ten lines ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
<START> a clever undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career <UNK> with his sights set on a us <UNK> in london he's <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> sharp maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob <UNK> this is a heist film with a lot of brains ustinov is exceptional as is smith and <UNK> is quite funny the real surprise is karl malden as the <UNK> popping executive vice president malden has seldom been so loose <UNK> romero and robert <UNK> pop up in some funny cameos the excellent music score is by laurie johnson eric <UNK> direction is <UNK> and the script by ustinov and ira <UNK> is first rate very smart a swinging good time
<START> a <UNK> plot and dubious characterizations don't make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is lively action and spectacular stunts for their day give this movie some real <UNK> and there's some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads quinn makes a good villain also although his role is completely overshadowed br br but don't be fooled by maureen <UNK> tough broad role this is as sexist as any hollywood movie of this era you might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made but it's still hard to get past for all the <UNK> and <UNK> adult off screen situations this is still little more than an adolescent good time
<START> a <UNK> falls in the country of a small town bringing a <UNK> creature an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand and the <UNK> steve andrews steve mcqueen and his girlfriend jane martin <UNK> <UNK> take him to dr t <UNK> steven chase the local doctor treats carefully the <UNK> and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man when steve returns he sees the blob killing the doctor steve and jane try to warn the police and the <UNK> but nobody believe on them while the blob <UNK> many people getting bigger and bigger br br the blob is a cult and classic sci fi it is a low budget movie with many ham actors and actresses with the exception of steve mcqueen awful effects but also delightful and very but very funny this is the first time that i see this classic i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci fi b movies from the 50s the film subject of my review number 1 400 could not be better my vote is seven br br title brazil a <UNK> the blob
<START> the best thing about this movie was uh well i can't think of anything this was bad the script was especially bad the technical concepts were bad the suspenseful plot was bad the dialog was bad avoid at all costs do not rent do not watch you'll be sorry
<START> this was a complete disappointment the acting isn't bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is o k if you are o k with cheesy moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that vastly <UNK> <UNK> if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it
<START> first before reading further you must understand that i'm not neo nazi i'm just trying to understand correctly hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again br br i've seen this series and found it awful i mean ok it's interesting to look but is it real i searched for answers and found one absolutely not first hitler wasn't angry all his life the series shows an angry hitler even when he is a child second hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter in fact it is highly <UNK> that hitler in reality was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret third people will hate me but it's true hitler was charming how do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly because he was charming that's a common point i found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him of course not jews br br this series was awful because if you think that hitler was just an angry bastard ugly and of course not charming at all you're wrong if you think that you will let people like him take power in countries and you don't want that if you really understand how hitler managed to get into power and stop thinking he was just awful you'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him of course remember he was elected and stop theme before it's too late br br life is important to protect this series is just awful to show us the truth if we continue to see hitler like that another one will take place exactly as the first did
<START> this movie is another fine example of what jerry bruckheimer since about 1997 seems to be best at <UNK> up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie i'm no film critic but this movie was as predictable as they come every attempt at a joke every attempt at a touching moment and the pitiful attempt at a love story was exactly what i was <UNK> in my mind do yourself a favor and save your money on this one
<START> okay so there is a front view of a <UNK> taxi probably late 1930s model it has the great <UNK> shaped <UNK> there also is a <UNK> cab in this black and white character driven almost a musical love gone wrong story br br the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel <UNK> the hair styles male and female are gorgeous if <UNK> <UNK> had victor <UNK> hair she could have made it big there is an artist <UNK> that would be the envy of every andy <UNK> wannabe br br if you watch this expecting a great casablanca storyline or sound of music <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you will be disappointed there is a nice little story beneath the <UNK> model approach in this film br br my copy on dvd with another movie for 1 was very <UNK> the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad mad mad mad world or the pink <UNK> this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane <UNK> that rko used to use br br i liked victor mature in one million b c and <UNK> and <UNK> and especially in violent saturday see if you can find that one he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or after the fox br br richard <UNK> went on to do i led three lives on tv in the early 1950s br br <UNK> mature was offered the part of <UNK> father in the remake of <UNK> and <UNK> he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as <UNK> victor <UNK> if the money is right i'll play <UNK> mother br br tom <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> denise richards david <UNK> even before i knew what this film was about these names were enough to draw me in gorgeous talented and popular these are performers to look out for br br ok where do i start we already know what the film is about five beautiful girls being targeted by a <UNK> serial slasher a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago his <UNK> include subtle <UNK> disguised as valentine cards <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a bleeding nose his weapon of choice well take a pick axe knife electric <UNK> bow and arrow hot iron etc ok so basically it's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality br br horror movies aren't supposed to be shakespeare but i'm not gonna go there i love horror movies but not all of them this one i adore it's up there with some of my other favorites it's funny sexy and scary the killer's mask is <UNK> creepy and seeing <UNK> firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky the acting is <UNK> denise richards <UNK> <UNK> and david <UNK> are a lot of fun i really did wish to see much much more of <UNK> <UNK> i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon jessica <UNK> is a very capable actress and jessica <UNK> gets to do the <UNK> blonde role she <UNK> in urban legend 2 the smaller parts were also good hedy <UNK> was a hoot <UNK> <UNK> and that younger version of denise richards looked <UNK> like her br br highlights every death scene had a particular distinction to it the <UNK> being the opening scene in the <UNK> the <UNK> scene while ludicrous was well done and the <UNK> <UNK> was sinister the soundtrack is great with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes br br <UNK> i felt as though the killer wasn't featured enough we barely saw the mask and it wasn't featured at all during the climax i also thought the climax was really <UNK> but fun nonetheless br br the twist at the end wasn't that big of a surprise but i'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole <UNK> <UNK> routine br br i don't like to tell people which movies they should see but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing then valentine would be it br br my rating 10 10 <UNK>
<START> this tv series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid even though i see it now through the pink <UNK> glasses of nostalgia i can still tell it was a quality show very educational but still funny i have not seen the original french version only the swedish i have no idea how good the dubbing was it was too long ago to remember br br the premise of the show was to show you how the body works i swear school still hasn't taught me half of what i know from this show it also tied in other things like what happens if you eat <UNK> food and don't exercise with nice examples within the body who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know <UNK> virus tanks can <UNK> you d the cartoon looked nice very kids friendly of course but done with care cells <UNK> electric <UNK> in the brain <UNK> and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body br br this and the series about history especially the <UNK> scary finale were key parts of my childhood i'm so happy i found them here
<START> hi im scott a k a <UNK> i love the film twisted desire and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t v as i think she is fine i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too so this helped my watch it don't ask i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very <UNK> as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the <UNK> so she wont give away her <UNK> a very well planned out idea back i guess it all <UNK> on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt i give this film a nine out of ten and put it in my top 10 films list and last but not least if anyone <UNK> this film in the <UNK> please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it bye
<START> a bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of great depression it tells us about another notorious hit man michael mike <UNK> somehow this time the story turns the other way round mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss he succeeds in his revenge and <UNK> honorable future to his son but gets killed in the end such stories never have happy end after all br br the role of mike <UNK> senior was wonderfully played by tom hanks and the part of mr rooney the mafia boss was performed by paul newman the film makes a great impression and we hear the well known phrase we rob banks this film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from sam <UNK> after his american beauty
<START> the movie is basically the story of a russian <UNK> return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend there are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored the core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of <UNK> that make dolls and sell them to buy <UNK> but are now missing the artist who made their dolls <UNK> apparently the movie is <UNK> the <UNK> journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud maybe that's supposed to impress us with the <UNK> of the russian landscape the village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of <UNK> and one male the <UNK> of the dead girl continuing the doll business is <UNK> for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could <UNK> <UNK> another problem for western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and <UNK> of the <UNK> don't go to this movie unless you're <UNK> in russian
<START> awful dreams wild <UNK> <UNK> and homosexual fantasies <UNK> paul verhoeven's <UNK> masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them filled with blood and occasional gore the fourth man is truly <UNK> inducing men will literally leap when <UNK> <UNK> out her <UNK>
<START> i wouldn't say this is a bad movie unfortunately for me i get the feeling that the more you know about <UNK> the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic i've been <UNK> since i was 14 years old and this movie portrays it very poorly f murray abraham is good and appears to have some <UNK> background but most of the other actors especially the students just seem to be lost
<START> what's the best way to start a review of a movie like der <UNK> let me start by saying i've just come direct from viewing this movie and the images are still burned deep into my brain and i don't think they'll be moving any time soon br br it's probably fair to say that if you're on this page you have a good idea what sort of film this is even if you haven't seen it if not let me <UNK> you that this is not a <UNK> budget gem that's been lost for a few years a la near dark nor is it a low budget <UNK> fun b movie what it is it low budget art put forward in a simple yet poignant way the idea is a simple one seven stories revolving around and ending in <UNK> interspersed with footage of a <UNK> corpse sounds simple right even boring it isn't words can't really describe how powerful this film becomes by the time you are halfway through it virtually draws you into it whether you want to go or not br br i could go on a <UNK> here about the technical pros and cons of the direction maybe point out that the scenes are obviously shot on super 8 cameras and are at sometimes shaky i could point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync in a way to rival any fulci movie but at the end of the day this all seems to pale into <UNK> br br as far as extreme movies go i've seen the hardest of them and yet der <UNK> moved me in a way that few others have managed despite not being particularly gory and having very few scenes that i would consider gratuitous in fact the most disturbing scene i found was the last tale i won't ruin it just to say that the character's emotional agony virtually <UNK> from the screen and makes you <UNK> if not <UNK> for his end br br sure it's not the best movie ever made and in a lot of places is seems crude and maybe a little amateurish but in spite of these flaws der <UNK> is an experience i would recommend to anyone who likes challenging cinema if you're someone who likes comfortable viewing or nice movies or simply wants to gross out on something brutal and pointless this is not what you're looking for br br whether you enjoy it or not it's one you won't forget in a hurry
<START> about the only thing i liked about this film is that there was just enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end i kept thinking that maybe in the next scene things would <UNK> alas br br those who like gus van <UNK> films especially his later ones will probably like this personally i find van <UNK> films to be dull pretentious and <UNK> well he was an executive producer for this film so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him although personally i actually liked this better than van <UNK> latest efforts e g elephant br br contrary to many here i did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed i thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all but i feel that the problem with the film is that mood is not enough and not only that but that the mood painted here is to my mind <UNK> chosen for the story that is supposedly happening the dream like quality so closely linked to nature is beautifully captured here but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold waves on a beach <UNK> and flowers <UNK> etc the rhythm of the film reminds me of my <UNK> when i was about eight or nine there is a <UNK> to the film that is in opposition to what should be a very tense time in an adolescent life when you are caught up in a crush on someone or being the object of bullying at school you are anything but <UNK> there are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film spoilers here first when logan drops the <UNK> and his mother throws a bit of a fit the <UNK> of an adult dealing with a <UNK> kid especially with no father present seemed real to me br br the second and only part of the film with any tension to it were the scenes where <UNK> <UNK> re creation of himself phones <UNK> and tries to seduce him into phone sex the first reason i liked it is because the person who did the voice over of <UNK> was the most convincing actor in the entire film it made me think of claire danes from my so called life the voice even sounded like claire she and <UNK> had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids and what i especially liked was the fact that <UNK> only <UNK> to play along it was perhaps the best moment in the film as finally we got some character development br br all in all a somewhat misplaced effort we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director's possible talents in the meantime if he can get away from van <UNK> influence it might do him a world of good who is this director anyhow one of van <UNK> boy toys
<START> it seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live <UNK> that for a <UNK> <UNK> if this movie was filmed near where i lived i wouldn't be mentioning it in my review it is horrid several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue in cheek horror movie it is neither it is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well i did laugh though at how unbelievably bad the film was br br this movie has 2 good things going for it the mask and the weapon of choice unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage the social commentary behind the film is also laughable juvenile and stupid don't bother with this movie you've already wasted time reading this review don't waste anymore on this movie <UNK> it's <UNK> that movies like this even get made i was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to alan <UNK> a name used when a person usually a director doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad br br there is nothing redeeming in this movie i spent 1 19 on the rental and feel i was ripped off avoid 1 out of 10
<START> after reading the book i happened across this dvd at wal mart for 3 bucks and thought sure what the hell i got the dvd and watched it last night when i started watching it i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes i thought ok cool it seemed to run rather slowly knowing the story and how much of it there was by the time i got to the actual killings i was like how much time does this have left checked one minute what the hell i felt incredibly cheated thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story br br but then i happily noticed that the dvd's scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2 i still had another hour and a half to go i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie even more so than the first br br i admit that i have not seen the 1967 original film despite my <UNK> desire to i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film for a two part tv miniseries that is i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me but still very well done the first half drags on a bit while the second half is much more gripping i think they should have <UNK> the movie more like capote did his book 1 3 before the murders 1 3 after and 1 3 after the killers are arrested instead the film makes it more 1 2 before the murders 1 4 after and 1 4 after the killers are arrested again this makes the second half more exciting but at the same time less compelling while making the first half drag on and on br br now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on so i will shut the hell up go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind br br nick <UNK>
<START> <UNK> ethnic <UNK> bad <UNK> <UNK> children singing the most <UNK> world music imaginable this is a tourist film and a lousy one what really kills it is the incoherent sequences india egypt south america africa etc etc no transitions no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away no ideas expressed in images just a bunch of footage of third <UNK> with <UNK> on their heads as another reviewer said walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning if these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of <UNK> were shot and film in mexico that would have been a much better setting for life in transformation br br but no what they decided on was a <UNK> tourist <UNK> covering half the globe and mind <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shots the only thing to recommend this film is that it doesn't suck quite as much as <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i've spent in a very very long time if you knew how often i went to the movies you'd probably say that's hard to imagine but never the less it's true after seeing the trailer for this movie i knew that i had to see it if you're a fan of horror mystery and suspense why wouldn't you the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting unfortunately the movie is none of these br br from the cinematography to the script to the acting this movie is a complete flop if you're reading this planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills mystery action horror or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty five minutes i'm afraid you are in for disappointment br br why is it so bad you might be asking yourself let me tell you the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful nothing about the movie made me the least bit on edge frightened or curious the script was at best laughable there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't the acting was absolutely dreadful i like nicholas cage but this was a miss without exception every performance in this movie was incredibly below average the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or <UNK> finally the story is completely transparent you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away br br i am not usually a very harsh critic frankly when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery suspense horror i just want to be surprised this movie was boring poorly acted poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment do yourself a favor and go see something else
<START> i went to see it 2 times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to <UNK> i couldn't enjoy it because i was not watching it in <UNK> position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party i loved the music it's just great br br if tom <UNK> <UNK> his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about if you can <UNK> this movie as your first you must be talented br br the acting is done by some great <UNK> stars <UNK> <UNK> and a bunch of <UNK> talents like <UNK> de <UNK> br br
<START> in don <UNK> 1971 masterpiece dirty harry clint eastwood <UNK> the super tough super cool <UNK> no nonsense cinema cop with his role of the eponymous inspector <UNK> harry callahan two sequels followed the first of which <UNK> force <UNK> down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had <UNK> many critics but <UNK> audiences the second sequel the <UNK> was <UNK> again and was promoted as the <UNK> harry of them all this title however truly belongs to the fourth film in the series clint eastwood's own sudden impact which is <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> most violent and downright <UNK> of all harry films and in my humble opinion the second best after the masterpiece original br br warning spoilers ahead in a small town near san francisco a mysterious sexy lady sondra locke <UNK> men into being alone with her what these men don't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim longing for bloody revenge as fate wants it san <UNK> <UNK> cop inspector dirty harry callahan who has been suspended once again for <UNK> his superiors spends his <UNK> time in this exact little town sudden impact is the <UNK> callahan film in several aspects the film is extremely gritty and <UNK> violent harry callahan himself is <UNK> than ever not afraid to make use of his <UNK> <UNK> in order to stop trouble harry treats <UNK> as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge murders are justified in his opinion clint eastwood is as always brilliant in the role of harry callahan eastwood <UNK> <UNK> and bad <UNK> as the man with no name in sergio <UNK> dollar trilogy and he did so again in the dirty harry films sudden impact gives us the <UNK> harry we have ever seen eastwood's real life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty the great pat <UNK> who had already worked with eastwood in ted <UNK> tough minded western hang 'em high in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable <UNK> characters including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard best known for his role in stanley kubrick's full metal jacket and a woman named ray <UNK> <UNK> j <UNK> <UNK> one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema albert <UNK> who played the bank <UNK> in the famous do you feel lucky scene in dirty harry and the black <UNK> leader in the <UNK> is also part of this one again this time as harry's colleague and buddy overall sudden impact is the <UNK> <UNK> and probably the most violent of all dirty harry films though the dead pool isn't exactly tame either and my second favorite after the brilliant 1971 original an absolute must see for callahan fans and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad <UNK> my rating 8 5 10

<START> in loving memory of david <UNK> <UNK> 2000 br br when i watched this movie for the first time i was 4 years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the 2nd world war the scene which impressed me the most was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the <UNK> singing their march this movie is fantastic from the trip to <UNK> road which became to me the most fantastic place of london to the journey to <UNK> angela lansbury and david <UNK> are really a fantastic couple she is always great it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always <UNK> face is her great co protagonist we'll miss him a lot
<START> i have to say i loved <UNK> point i've seen the original and this is a pretty good remake of it even though it didn't follow the original storyline that's why i gave it 8 out of 10 it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline br br as for the car well the <UNK> comment at the end about the <UNK> going <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> is pretty improbable and if you look the <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> at <UNK> 150 but even though i didn't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine the original storyline had a <UNK> <UNK> so it's possible for those of you who say <UNK> wouldn't allow it the normally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of today can go <UNK> <UNK> and if you look at that thing going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 <UNK> plus in a wind tunnel test if you put an air <UNK> on the <UNK> it would probably be more <UNK>
<START> i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo 3 <UNK> <UNK> deep impact but mr <UNK> almost succeeded <UNK> was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that <UNK> are a miserable pathetic bunch of <UNK> it shows a world where love and humanity don't exist a world where people <UNK> each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of <UNK> shock <UNK> <UNK> director <UNK> wants to make us believe that this is real life in <UNK> european western <UNK> the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex <UNK> violence against women and handicapped people madness and <UNK> but this isn't social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a <UNK> hammer and it looks down on people in a <UNK> condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly <UNK> way and this is why this film is truly despicable
<START> i remember the first time i saw this movie i was in the office working over the weekend the tv was on for background noise but i gradually found myself more more engaged in this movie i'd never seen or heard of until i was completely absorbed a matter of life death the british title <UNK> to heaven in the us is delightful compelling whimsical moving all in one superbly written well acted perfectly directed package it's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca it's a wonderful life gone with the wind citizen kane <UNK> of fire why has it never received the same public notice video store <UNK> fortunately some <UNK> critics have put it on their top 100 of all time lists there is hope 1940's <UNK> wasn't a hit <UNK> the '60s the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office but made a hit by tv buy it rent it watch it demand it you won't be disappointed
<START> and laugh out loud funny in many scenes br br the movie's basic plot is well <UNK> a story of <UNK> trying to find a way to survive each other in close <UNK> br br this is <UNK> lemmon and <UNK> best film as co stars and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the <UNK> felix are classic br br the scene where oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is <UNK> funny br br for any fan of intelligent comedies the odd couple is a go out of your way to see it film
<START> jane russell proved to be a delightful musical comedy performer in the similarly titled gentlemen prefer <UNK>  but sadly this film <UNK> those skills there is a budget and nice paris photography but the film just doesn't work ms russell seems to be playing marilyn monroe that leaves nobody to adequately play jane russell some of the other players are way out of their element br br there are several embarrassing scenes most of all be warned there is a musical number where <UNK> african cannibals cook the <UNK> in a pot after alan young sings in a gorilla suit br br this is an interesting at times embarrassing waste of resources br br gentlemen marry <UNK> 10 <UNK> <UNK> richard sale jane russell <UNK> <UNK> alan young scott brady
<START> this is not my favorite <UNK> women in prison but it is one of the most famous films in the sub genre it is was produced by roger corman who at this point had already produced a few <UNK> it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula the movie takes place in an usa prison not in a banana republic like most <UNK> films i'm not sure if that was a wise move but it is an acceptable change of pace writer director <UNK> really gets into his job always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario in fact he is a little too ambitious for his own good the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks in chains flick but do not worry <UNK> still <UNK> within the <UNK> of the sub genre there is plenty of nudity and violence something that will satisfy hardcore fans the film is a little slow but it is very entertaining the cast is good <UNK> collins is a <UNK> veteran so she does not need an introduction and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair bound crazy warden pam <UNK> is sorely missed though
<START> there is absolutely no plot in this movie no character development no climax nothing but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good so there you go as a movie overall is pretty bad but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie do not expect nothing more that just that decent acting and a not so bad direction a couple of cameos from <UNK> and <UNK> i was looking to see <UNK> a little bit more in this movie she is a good fighter and a really hot girl white is a great martial artist and a decent actor i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art imagine a film with white and <UNK> together that would be awesome
<START> i never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film that goes for critics as well sure if it gets positive reviews that's ok and a plus but most films that get critical rave i hate i enjoyed this film for what it was an entertaining film it takes you out of your life for a couple hours and into a fictional character that being catherine <UNK> sharon stone is awesome in this role just like she was in the first one anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one b c she is back acting the same way she did in basic instinct 1 catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection her one liners are great much like in the first one who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops if you're gonna arrest me do it otherwise get the f k out of here great scene and believe me she does it again in this one i was captivated by her her outfits the way she <UNK> her <UNK> believe me its worth the price just to see <UNK> performance i cannot wait for this film to be released on dvd uncut because i can only imagine how much better it is going to be and yes there are lots of twists as in the first one including the ending
<START> this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who <UNK> up all the <UNK> etc funny thing is you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you <UNK> anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police br br nonetheless woody <UNK> as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes br br snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor the bad part of the film which doesn't bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the <UNK> of all the characters that includes <UNK> girlfriend played by <UNK> <UNK> there are no really clean nice people in this movie for that reason i can't honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a <UNK> profanity
<START> in the tradition of g men the house on <UNK> street the street with no name now comes the fbi story one of those carefully <UNK> films that showed the federal <UNK> of investigation in the best possible light while it's 48 year director j edgar hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of light br br the book by don <UNK> that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the <UNK> from it's <UNK> in <UNK> until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out it's important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j edgar hoover headed it some of that time is covered in the film as well br br but warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john <UNK> <UNK> was created <UNK> as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who <UNK> law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the <UNK> in the early <UNK> br br in real life the <UNK> was headed by william j burns of the burns private detective agency it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film burns was on the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the <UNK> administration when hoover was <UNK> in <UNK> to bring professional law <UNK> techniques and <UNK> standards of <UNK> in he did just that br br through the <UNK> family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the <UNK> story itself stewart and miles are most <UNK> an all american couple we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> members a plot to murder oil rich indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with <UNK> nazi <UNK> in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold war br br there is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the <UNK> as it <UNK> with his own that involves a bomb placed on an <UNK> by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight nick adams will give you the creeps as the <UNK> and the story is sadly relevant today br br of course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one br br the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart's best films but it's the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special <UNK> for me if the whole fbi were made up jimmy <UNK> i'd feel a lot better about it there's also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelson br br vera miles didn't just marry stewart she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates it's dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell
<START> a female country singer <UNK> big t seriously that's what they call her risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy <UNK> busey who wants to be her manager his mother committed suicide his father's an alcoholic as well and he has a violent temper you can imagine where that leads in the meantime there's music <UNK> as <UNK> with her fluid vocal talents <UNK> out song after song at least half a dozen of them about texas steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel <UNK> instead
<START> in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made this film <UNK> that make life worthwhile it is not an original discovery by many voice you have quite off the pitch by the way but it <UNK> somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema the downside is that the elements <UNK> the film are poorly combined and while some points are not well developed others are out of place a day in the lives of two people close to the <UNK> age it's basically what the movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> one which despite load on your back with a drama major seems willing to see things change only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence in line with audrey <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> jean pierre <UNK> 2004 <UNK> says things like this to herself if i find a <UNK> before the corner that is now going to change my luck of course it finds it begins to play <UNK> could be a great <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> un <UNK> <UNK> by joan <UNK> <UNK> and in a few crosses on its way <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she is another woman entry age divorced and a little lonely take <UNK> for sleeping <UNK> birthday parties as an <UNK> mother said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother <UNK> is a woman of many <UNK> in his behavior life was going in his head driving data as 70 of people fall in love only once in a lifetime and said although it is short of <UNK> and unemployed and does not <UNK> the possibility that it is a sadistic sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity later came a <UNK> a dance in the <UNK> wedding <UNK> the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer <UNK> that make life <UNK> debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and <UNK> make us take the case as a comedy focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding which seem to be amusing in itself or the <UNK> of a drunk person the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players therefore we can not identify with the dramatic and not give us a solid base comic too leaving everything except pure joke in the end all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or <UNK> and ends up not doing either and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner but it is not <UNK> different or special as we want to do <UNK> <UNK> which apparently far less than the <UNK> years that has in this film and <UNK> <UNK> are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that <UNK> in the film so in moments like the accident with the children of the bar thing seems to be <UNK> from their hands perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do but that is no excuse to lower our guard in any case both <UNK> are <UNK> easily the highlight of the function <UNK> that make life <UNK> work only up to the modest level of entertainment any claim that is beyond that point has not been <UNK> as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that we presume they wanted to do can not afford to have little moments finished successful beyond bad as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh lost drunk compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him neither do much for people like rosario <UNK> making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase must be screwed over and songs from the soundtrack though significant not just fit it is true that the film by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has its hits some of the moments involving jose <UNK> but the whole is a <UNK> story a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better
<START> it is like what the title of this thread say only impression i got from that movie is that <UNK> <UNK> character was always angry so cynical and so pathetic her character's first date with william <UNK> character where they were dancing were dumb all in all i've tried to finish watching the movie four times and of all four times i fell asleep i would keep watching that movie with one intention to beat my problem with insomnia because all it do is to put me to sleep sweet dream
<START> i saw this movie and the play and i have to add that this was the most touching story that i had ever seen until i saw this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african children and adults that were and are living in that era it brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive and to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and <UNK> and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing this simply <UNK> a five star i rate it a ten thank you mr <UNK> <UNK> for such a astonishing story although it has been 12 years since this story has been told it is still one that lays heavy in my heart if there is a vhs or dvd out there on the play please <UNK> me <UNK> thank you ps there was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance
<START> this is a tepid <UNK> drama that covers no new ground <UNK> all the cliches and is sloppy with facts for example <UNK> is a very flat city so why is it <UNK> in the movie for example the end of the great war in <UNK> was not a surrender but an <UNK> yet it is announced as a surrender for example european news <UNK> did not and do not shout <UNK> as they <UNK> their papers yet this strictly american <UNK> is employed in the film for example the nazis did not adopt the german eagle until after they had taken power but there it is on the <UNK> as hitler delivers one of his <UNK> <UNK> indeed most of this disappointing production consists of little more than <UNK> <UNK> the movie also <UNK> the myth that the beer hall <UNK> was <UNK> at the <UNK> <UNK> it was not robert <UNK> does a fine portrayal of his subject but his supporting cast is adequate at best and very often not even that these comments are based on the first episode only one only can hope the second will be better but don't bet on it
<START> i took a chance on <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> the first <UNK> worth canadian release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it 5 stars on amazon and i am rating it 10 stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j <UNK> <UNK> at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
<START> i saw this film on its release and have watched it 3 or 4 more times including last week i regret i have to be a voice of <UNK> with regard to mr branagh's performance br br this is really a glorious <UNK> film to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long beautifully shot and designed derek <UNK> julie christie kate <UNK> richard <UNK> and many others do fine jobs then there's kenneth branagh if ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and mr branagh <UNK> nothing in putting the ham in hamlet from the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon to the bits of distracting business thrown in to <UNK> a sense of <UNK> to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous <UNK> in all of literature to screaming every line of others his performance <UNK> that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never been a great film actor the scenery budget could be charged to <UNK> mr branagh eats so much of it his performance is a perfect example of why people don't go to see shakespeare full of sound and fury <UNK> nothing and if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance br br no matter what theories people may <UNK> on the <UNK> he was after all is said and done a playwright the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting shakespeare himself gives <UNK> to the players in the text of hamlet itself it <UNK> me how mr branagh mouthed it but did not hear it it was an example of spending too much time working out how he's going to say something and too little <UNK> out what he's saying br br while mr branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in <UNK> some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it his direction has always been better than his acting i still give him immense credit for <UNK> interest in filming shakespeare he set a great <UNK> for other productions and it would be interesting to see him <UNK> from about 20 <UNK> back but i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less br br is it worth seeing certainly there are many little <UNK> to be found in the film but it's a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it
<START> sarah silverman is like a totally manic <UNK> <UNK> and i think i'm in love already yeah if you loved jesus is magic you'll love this if you didn't what the heck is wrong with you kudos to the comedy channel for <UNK> this in my face my life finally has meaning and your car <UNK> like <UNK> is my kind of humor i'm a happy guy the first episode had me laughing hysterically and i'm <UNK> looking forward to next week this is like grease meets south park completely outrageous sarah silverman is someone i could watch reading the phone book her delivery is precise and oh so funny she never <UNK> a beat come to think of it it's not so much her choice of material which is some really good stuff by the way as it is the way she chooses to deliver it thank you sarah silverman thank you comedy channel
<START> let's face it the final season 8 was one of the worst seasons in any show i've ever enjoyed mostly i've never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course it's going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair <UNK> because that '70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a <UNK> era and how the people who lived there weren't so different than we are here in modern times br br all right ignoring season 8 br br <UNK> grace stars as eric <UNK> a horny geek of a teenager with a <UNK> love of donna laura <UNK> the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde <UNK> <UNK> jackie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably <UNK> a foreign exchange student who is as mentally <UNK> as they get what country is he from try to figure it out for another dimension of entertainment debra jo <UNK> and <UNK> smith are phenomenal as <UNK> parents <UNK> as kitty is both <UNK> and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie <UNK> while smith's red exists mainly to scare the <UNK> out of everyone don stark and <UNK> roberts play very well opposite each other as <UNK> parents the <UNK> but likable bob and the <UNK> <UNK> tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a <UNK> who acts as a father figure to hyde br br apart from the <UNK> errors that pop up quite frequently and the over the top lessons that sometimes come and that <UNK> final season '70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spot on direction and a feel good vibe <UNK> through every episode they're all alright
<START> this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like <UNK> and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at times yes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars
<START> oh dear some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many scenes br br there are some frightening scenes in this <UNK> mystery mostly when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i'm afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny such as the moment when the hero discovers a <UNK> corpse on a golf course oh look there's a hand oh and there's another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling br br for many years fans of british cult tv shows <UNK> to have this serial released on vhs or dvd but the bbc always said no now i think i understand why
<START> i watched the first series <UNK> but wondered whether i'd go back again after a lengthy break from it however i tuned into episode one of series 2 and was hooked all over again this really is excellent telly ground breaking stuff like mission impossible back in the 1960s the characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on they change as they adapt some more readily than others to their new surroundings but they cleverly remain strictly in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry for when something really <UNK> happens to them i hope there will be many years of <UNK> to look forward to and i don't actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries
<START> the last time i saw the movie i was around seven years so my opinions might be jaded over time at the time i enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action at the time i felt sad for the blue <UNK> and his sad life also i felt glee when after captain <UNK> kidnapped the heroine a princess or toy <UNK> the tables the were turned on him unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to vhs so all i have are twenty year old memories i am sure that if i saw the movie again i would consider it corny and sappy but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time
<START> eye in the <UNK> is not your average giallo and to be honest i'm not really sure that it really is a giallo but giallo or not despite some problems this is certainly a very interesting little film i'm <UNK> to call it a giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the <UNK> and this would seem to be one of them the film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many <UNK> do but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie his patient who for some reason she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her we then <UNK> to a big house lived in by a number of people but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before <UNK> arrival br br the film seems to be <UNK> something about how the mind is like a <UNK> this never really comes off and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point if any the film is trying to make eye in the <UNK> is directed by mario <UNK> the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier he doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one but the surreal aspects of the story come off well and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring the film stars <UNK> <UNK> who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning with the exceptions of <UNK> <UNK> who is good as the villain of the piece and <UNK> <UNK> whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks the film does explain itself at the end which is lucky as i'm sure i'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then overall this may not be classic stuff but its good enough and worth seeing
<START> i thought it was an extremely clever film i was very pleased with it and truly <UNK> ask for more i actually own the film because i didn't return it to someone which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it also the fact i don't own too many foreign films and this is a first now i personally love <UNK> stuff so that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching however if you're not into the whole trying to understand <UNK> or read subtitles bit then this film is not for you br br 9 10 for sure
<START> bored and unhappy young babe <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and vibrant performance by <UNK> brunette <UNK> erika anderson feels trapped in a stale and <UNK> marriage to failed poet and decent yet dull businessman <UNK> martin a solid and credible portrayal by judge <UNK> <UNK> has a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with sleazy and arrogant artist johnny collins deliciously played to the slimy <UNK> by nicolas cage can the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> be <UNK> or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed director sam <UNK> and screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> lay on the <UNK> soap opera style <UNK> something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences the plot goes <UNK> off the <UNK> in the laughably <UNK> last third the dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar <UNK> line i wanna shake you naked and eat you alive better still this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity the <UNK> <UNK> anderson looks smoking hot in the buff and <UNK> semi pornographic soft core sex scenes johnny and <UNK> doing the dirty deed in a church <UNK> booth rates as a definite steamy highlight the <UNK> new orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings with his long <UNK> black hair <UNK> mustache foul mouth and coarse manners <UNK> johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing romantic lead to ever <UNK> his way onto celluloid the cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity anderson cage and <UNK> all do respectable work with their parts with fine support from joe <UNK> as <UNK> merry flamboyant homosexual friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> wise <UNK> mother <UNK> aaron <UNK> as friendly bartender jack and steve <UNK> as a funny <UNK> shameless thief walt <UNK> sharp and <UNK> cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look the <UNK> <UNK> score by pray for rain likewise hits the spot a delightfully campy and <UNK> riot
<START> it started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as it's a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 <UNK> we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies helping others mind over matter when you don't want to do something br br of special note is the girl who played <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kate <UNK> the director kinda <UNK> her in unexpectedly and when she is on screen she is captivating she's one of those hey she looks familiar faces and then i remembered that she was the little girl that <UNK> featured about 8 years ago she was also in paulie that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home br br ms <UNK> made many tv and movie appearances in <UNK> 00 but then was not seen much for the next few years she's now 14 and is growing up to be a beautiful woman her smile really <UNK> up the screen if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career or better than <UNK> joel <UNK> another three named kid actor but hopefully without some of the problems that <UNK> has been in lately br br <UNK> according to my 8 y o son who just finished reading the story the film did not seem to follow the book all that well but was entertaining none the less the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels how to eat boiled slugs <UNK> kid's style which might not be such a bad thing it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language violence or sex scenes br br one other good aspect of the movie was the respect fear <UNK> by the principal mr <UNK> <UNK> movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as <UNK> while he has one particular goofy scene he ruled the school with a firm hand it was also nice to see <UNK> martin getting some work
<START> first the cgi in this movie was horrible i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel at the end when the owner of the park gets killed it's probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen even night of the living dead had better animation br br that said the movie had almost no plot why were they on that island in particular well it wasn't stated in the movie and why would the people keep coming into the <UNK> area makes no sense br br one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting in what could be called a b made for tv movie movie the acting was very good <UNK> <UNK> stood out in particular br br if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday watch this movie it may be good for some memorable quotes
<START> i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it but it sounded cool and i've been wanting to see a really kick butt <UNK> movie for awhile now alas this film was not what i was looking for i had hoped for the best but instead was delivered a boring <UNK> soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its <UNK> minute running time the film's premise is intriguing enough it's about a <UNK> <UNK> who defies his god and <UNK> is so <UNK> that he <UNK> the <UNK> son named <UNK> to death and <UNK> as a <UNK> this <UNK> guy is then forced to live <UNK> insane and violent lifetime after lifetime the movie is filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography and quasi good performances by the actors but again i found myself bored and questioning when this <UNK> would end the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi unique but they dropped the ball perhaps it could've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore i mean we are talking about <UNK> here aren't we <UNK> were supposed to be bad enough what with all the <UNK> and <UNK> so aren't <UNK> supposed to be even more extreme all in all unless you're a fan of the young and restless etc or are yourself in fact an insane <UNK> who likes self torture i'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid
<START> back in 1997 do i remember that year <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> research the unfortunate death of princess diana the <UNK> won the world series and a woman gave birth to <UNK> this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i don't think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls i was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didn't watch the film since i was 14 a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for 5 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that <UNK> real nose ok i know that's silly to say but i did re watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage br br the film starts with <UNK> <UNK> and his team exploring the wreck of the <UNK> titanic searching for a <UNK> set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean <UNK> they instead discover a drawing of a young woman <UNK> nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic <UNK> 101 year old rose dawson <UNK> learns of the drawing and contacts <UNK> to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> <UNK> visit <UNK> and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the <UNK> of the <UNK> rose <UNK> recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> the upper class 17 year old rose boards the ship with her fiancé cal <UNK> and her mother ruth <UNK> <UNK> both of whom stress the importance of <UNK> engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while they have the <UNK> appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are <UNK> broke <UNK> and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson <UNK> jack and rose strike up a <UNK> friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and <UNK> their bond <UNK> when they leave a <UNK> first class <UNK> dinner of the <UNK> building wealthy for a much <UNK> gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class but after <UNK> servant informs him of <UNK> <UNK> rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman <UNK> her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first <UNK> fun time they go to the deck of the ship br br they then witness the <UNK> fatal <UNK> with an iceberg after <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> discussing how serious the <UNK> is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers <UNK> nude drawing and her <UNK> note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having <UNK> plant it in jack's pocket upon learning cal <UNK> to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they <UNK> her to board a <UNK> but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and <UNK> with jack in the <UNK> first class <UNK> jack and rose return to the top deck the <UNK> have gone and the ship finally goes down into the <UNK> atlantic taking jack and rose down br br so does titanic live up to it's hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few <UNK> that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of <UNK> baby face or <UNK> amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day br br 10 10
<START> this was a big disappointment for me i think this is the worst mastroianni movie ever made <UNK> tries too hard to make this movie a masterpiece and that makes this movie a typical art movie i give 4 10 for this movie
<START> this movie was so very badly written the characters had no depth they should have never made a movie of this my 11 <UNK> old son could write a better screenplay then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the only actor that didn't suck was the <UNK> guard he was the only funny and believable one of the lot br br i love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2 number 1 being <UNK> br br for those of you who actually thought this was a good movie you are in serious need of brain surgery br br most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons so why did they call d war
<START> <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> as above so below that very special point where divine and human meet i adore this film a gem yes amazing grace br br i was so deeply moved by its very human quality i laughed and cried through a whole register indeed several <UNK> of emotions br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brilliant as daniel a first rate passionate performance charismatic and powerful his inner light and exceptional talent shines through in every scene every interaction in every meeting i was totally <UNK> enchanted and caught up the story which is our collective story the story of life itself br br the film was also so <UNK> of many <UNK> <UNK> wounded child magical child artist teacher priest <UNK> abused victim bully divine fool all the characters so real and true to life all <UNK> great <UNK> and compassion in me br br it is a real treat to see such a thought provoking yet thoroughly enjoyable entertaining film oh <UNK> forget the heavenly choir of angels and <UNK> beautiful sound br br thank you all this swedish film will surely <UNK> people world wide brilliant
<START> my roommates i nearly <UNK> out our tv from the numerous spit takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo <UNK> dreck i'd read about this <UNK> for ages and <UNK> my local late night tv <UNK> for years in search of this <UNK> turd several years ago our local abc <UNK> was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick ie <UNK> night of the <UNK> etc then one day it happened at 1 <UNK> on a saturday night over 5 years ago there it was we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint br br see andy griffith as the <UNK> most <UNK> bad guy since <UNK> <UNK> in stargate br br see william shatner sport a variety of things <UNK> his head that only <UNK> resemble human hair or anything <UNK> for that matter br br hear jaw <UNK> inane 1970s <UNK> that makes chicken soup for the soul sound like <UNK> <UNK> br br feel content that any decade was better than the 70s br br for those still reading the plot <UNK> a bunch of middle class mid level a holes who decide to suck up to their s head boss griffith by joining him on a cross <UNK> race that <UNK> california mexico they all wear leather <UNK> looking more christopher street than anything else along the way they stop at a <UNK> get drunk smoke <UNK> the sight robert mike brady reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget start a fight attempt rape and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked <UNK>
<START> william <UNK> and paul <UNK> share director writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines feet <UNK> up by the fire and <UNK> banter back and forth and a <UNK> town tramp named ralph <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> fame wanders over and <UNK> four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire br br one tale is the old <UNK> of the hook two teens on <UNK> lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand another story has a couple of <UNK> needing to score some <UNK> they stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s t as they smoke a couple of <UNK> full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it <UNK> up and falls off one of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for christmas who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about satan claus the fourth <UNK> tale is of a greedy sailor that <UNK> <UNK> upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies br br without a big budget for special effects <UNK> tales gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse a bit corny but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale the acting is understandably not award worthy cast members include <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> h ray york johnny <UNK> walter <UNK> kevin <UNK> david <UNK> and paul <UNK>
<START> there are a few spoilers in this comment br br contrary to the comments i just read by <UNK> and a few others i really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series br br i am a <UNK> mills fan but also a huge chuck norris fan and while i'll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired br br the opening fifteen minutes with <UNK> running from the bad guys after blowing up their <UNK> was very action packed i do fail to see how that many professionals weren't able to hit a moving target but the action was definitely there and <UNK> being the hero had to survive br br as for the comment about needing to get the movie in the can to fill the time <UNK> after the <UNK> this movie was not originally <UNK> by cbs for a january airing and filming was completed in may of 2001 a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the u s br br if the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it maybe they would have realized the plot of the story <UNK> a bin laden like character planned to set off a nuclear device in the united states the <UNK> man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem br br perhaps the writer should actually watch the movie before attempting to comment on it br br
<START> this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television i mean the acting is great the suspense the drama the comedy it has everything and with such a simple story a plane crashed on an island the characters are great and <UNK> <UNK> is hot matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is josh <UNK> is so great <UNK> garcia is hilarious i could go on and on also the unexpected plot twists the back stories of the characters the music that is at the end of every episode j j <UNK> has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is i mean this is better than <UNK> and i loved <UNK> whoever isn't watching this show should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it because they are missing something great this show could possibly be the best show in television history
<START> surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own this film works on so many levels so why is it completely <UNK> on tape dvd never shown on tv why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses
<START> this is the second film i've seen of <UNK> <UNK> as a director after <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> i think this one was a better film then that one this one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually <UNK> and doesn't like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family i think leonard <UNK> review is right only to give it 2 and 1 2 stars
<START> i caught this movie on <UNK> and i enjoyed it although i felt like the editing job was a little rough though it may have been deliberate i had a little bit of a hard time <UNK> out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a pulp fiction style non linear plot presentation it seemed a little forced though i certainly think that the movie is worth watching but i think it could have used a little cleaning up some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others br br i'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is it's not outstanding but it doesn't have any really serious problems i gave it a 7 10 the movie did show at least that laurence fishburne can act when he wants to they must have just told him not to in the matrix movies
<START> this film is too <UNK> it's a fairly low budget film i hope which excuses it somewhat but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn apart son of a well off family who's searching for himself though his family is er well a little too white but the rest of the cast is <UNK> at <UNK> every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are way too many sub plots which is an obvious sign of plot <UNK> they needed filler i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard core phillips fan or who has absolutely nothing to do 4 10
<START> class reunion is a very <UNK> comedy gem it's 1982 and the 1972 class of <UNK> <UNK> high return for there 10 year reunion among them are the usual stereotypes the hunk babe the fat guy nerd etc but the former students are in for a <UNK> night one of their classmates is walter <UNK> the class <UNK> who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on <UNK> night and since then has been in a mental home walter escapes and now plans to avenge his <UNK> br br despite the dark premise this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags set pieces to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun airplane movies you'll love this what other film offers a music cameo by chuck <UNK> a great comedy which deserves a wider audience
<START> should have been titled <UNK> ' little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact <UNK> were involved little more than training film quality with poor camera work <UNK> stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping <UNK> with laughing japanese <UNK> laughing japanese fighter pilots and one dimensional square <UNK> americans dying left and right sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd <UNK> and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you the plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a <UNK> afternoon in my childhood <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend steve and my little brother in actual fact the <UNK> island raid was a near total failure with <UNK> and his men wandering around in the dark <UNK> <UNK> with shadows until finally <UNK> and completely <UNK> looking for someone to surrender to before they happened upon some equally confused japanese soldiers who promptly <UNK> to them in the <UNK> several of <UNK> marines ended up on another island and were abandoned the film of course couldn't tell that story not in 1943 so this bit of <UNK> was <UNK> and rushed into release to the beating of drums with randolph scott and his jaw as colonel <UNK> <UNK> leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures the green <UNK> harry <UNK> robert mitchum the <UNK> veteran j <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stone sam <UNK> the country <UNK> rod cameron the all american boy alan curtis and scores of <UNK> when they weren't laughing <UNK> and yet the cast nearly <UNK> the material almost randolph scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin <UNK> but in the end the one note object of the exercise wins any <UNK> is totally abandoned at the close when randy scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring well sorta stirring call to arms the cast was better than this material so was the audience should be viewed with <UNK> madness and a bottle of moderately <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked <UNK> <UNK> from this director <UNK> <UNK> but the script of les <UNK> is very poor why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario
<START> how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of <UNK> <UNK> horrible script annoyingly <UNK> camera awfully edited <UNK> badly acted only rhys <UNK> tries to fill his role with life another painful proof that different sometimes equals dreck why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand do yourself a favour spare yourself and do something else like hitting a <UNK> onto your knees it's less painful and more fun than this movie
<START> contains slight spoilers br br it's interesting how anthony mann uses james stewart here stewart is of course remembered by many as george <UNK> from frank <UNK> it's a wonderful life so it's easy to find parallels between the two films in it's a wonderful life <UNK> gets to see the world as it would have been if he had never been born in the far country stewart's jeff <UNK> by not getting involved to help anyone else except himself gets to see essentially the same thing a world in which he for all practical matters doesn't exist br br by not getting involved and by attempting not to care about anyone <UNK> is forced to see those for whom he can't help but care get hurt pushed around and even killed while he stands by and does nothing this reminds the viewer of george <UNK> watching a world that has turned upside down because he has also decided not to get involved by not ever having been born br br both movies end with the same image a close up of a <UNK> bell stewart by turning around his philosophy of non involvement has it would seem earned his wings
<START> some wonder why there weren't anymore mrs murphy movies after this one will it's because this movie totally blew <UNK> disney was not the right studio to run this film maybe <UNK> well they're owned by disney but it'd be more adult the film is too kid ish as the book series is not the casting is all wrong for the characters the characters don't even act the way they do in the books and why was tucker changed to a guy he's a girl in the <UNK> books was this done to make the film appeal to boys <UNK> and where was <UNK> the gray cat one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth rita mae brown is a good writer but letting disney blow her work was wrong an animated feature film perhaps in the <UNK> of don <UNK> artwork would suit a better mrs murphy film overall i give this a 2 because at least disney made a film from an under appreciated book series but i wish they did better either way i still have my books to entertain me
<START> disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn't make at least two sequels about and this one was no exception to the people at disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward somehow although i did not pay to view it i feel <UNK> by watching it br br ariel is grown up now and had a daughter yet doesn't allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some <UNK> threat made by the sister of the deceased sea witch so here we go again br br the daughter is tricked of course and helps the sea witch after a not so glorious battle she is defeated and the <UNK> and humans live in harmony yawn br br there is nothing to view here go back to your lives d
<START> i've never laughed and <UNK> so much in my life the first half kept me in <UNK> the last half made me come completely <UNK> i think i <UNK> for 15 minutes after the tape was over br br his timing and delivery for his stories is almost <UNK> and though he talks fast you catch every joke which is probably why my laugh center was so overwhelmed it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything br br
<START> anyone who's watched a few lifetime movie network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets <UNK> off the planning table so when crazed lara moves into <UNK> home and <UNK> begins to drive her <UNK> <UNK> i didn't even blink when lara eventually <UNK> up her activities to threatening poor <UNK> and <UNK> her to do anything about it i just <UNK> you see on planet <UNK> people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason they just do it to keep the action going only on planet <UNK> could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers poor <UNK> she just trusted too much and lara went off her medicine and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a <UNK> full of deadly stuff that ends up <UNK> into someone's <UNK> and a body bag going out the front door the horror br br but take it from me this planet <UNK> product is a classic you need to watch it once just for the great laughs you'll have on the <UNK> scale i give this film a 95 100 make a big <UNK> of popcorn and get some apple <UNK> too you'll understand later
<START> this movie is pure <UNK> mom always said if you can't say anything nice but even mom would say i had to do my part to warn others of this movie br br i can guarantee this is the film that geoffrey rush wishes would just go away i would hope that greg kinnear fired his agent from a cannon for giving him the script after this ben stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch there's still something about mary i have always been a fan of wes <UNK> thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him br br it starts of <UNK> with a <UNK> spoof of the cinematography of the batman films and then just loses something like a coherent plot and half decent effects br br the jokes are <UNK> an hour before the punchline comes and even then they fall flat if you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see chasing amy br br run don't walk away from mystery men
<START> thomas archer ron <UNK> has his child killed and his wife <UNK> attacked in a home invasion dr <UNK> christopher plummer tries to help him through the post traumatic stress then archer finds himself confronted with a man <UNK> <UNK> bound and <UNK> to a chair he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him and there's a large assortment of <UNK> there to help him br br film is interesting at first and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore but gets <UNK> by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore how such talented actors like <UNK> <UNK> and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through
<START> this is a film about <UNK> century italian artists and one artist in particular a woman artemisia an <UNK> of profession for females at that time and she <UNK> to paint the male nude <UNK> his unique <UNK> br br the camera work is <UNK> <UNK> for that is where the artists mainly worked there are some great shots close ups by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical <UNK> and it is fascinating to watch the <UNK> and their students supported by elaborate <UNK> <UNK> in details of religious <UNK> it is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film costumes faces make up are quite superbly authentic because the italian <UNK> have <UNK> all these details in their <UNK> for centuries the beautiful artemisia is <UNK> by her father to study under the great <UNK> artist <UNK> who has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting something very new but the unsuspecting artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in painting after posing for her <UNK> violently rapes her her father is <UNK> court proceedings follow br br this romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an <UNK> ending the outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail scenes such as women running across a field with the wind <UNK> their <UNK> clothing add wonderful effects br br artemisia says she paints to please herself her father paints to please others as for this film it will please most i think
<START> after we counted the use of the f word oh about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off relying on gratuitous profanity and <UNK> humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and no talent writers br br we did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better no <UNK> later my boyfriend <UNK> through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no <UNK> br br the main character did have a cool bike br br i wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature <UNK> or frat boys
<START> final score an average of various classic cinematic qualities acting visuals creativity payoff humor fun <UNK> br br 4 3 out of 10 br br had atlantis the lost empire come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold serious new direction in disney animation however it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius the <UNK> new groove and marks a step back in <UNK> disney from it's <UNK> disney formula i'm a big fan of the feature length disney animated films have to see them all love it or hate it atlantis is an animated <UNK> to 20 000 <UNK> under the sea and similar live action sci fi adventures of the 50s and 60s problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea it feels like a remake of something even more so than actual disney remakes tarzan the <UNK> of <UNK> dame the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically <UNK> these type of films the oddball mechanic the <UNK> ho general the sassy tough women beyond milo <UNK> fox and rourke garner the supporting cast is flat out obnoxious the movie also suffers from it's <UNK> pace instead of <UNK> it out into an epic story disney <UNK> a lot in the usually brief running time <UNK> over opportunities to develop <UNK> characters anything really they <UNK> us into this new and <UNK> world and barely let us get our <UNK> the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story the animation is dark and dreary and cheap this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon let's hope they haven't forgotten that <UNK> traditional animation can still be <UNK> the iron giant among others proved that br br <UNK> the visuals pace and sheer lack of originality br br <UNK> quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time it's the creative highlight of the movie
<START> to watch this film from start to finish without <UNK> into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith as one has to keep saying to <UNK> it's old it's a classic be kind not because the movie is so bad but because at its best it's so good this is one dated movie it's also a classic if a <UNK> one i'm not inclined to laugh at people anyway on principle and i get more than a little irritated when others do so to make fun of the informer to my mind is a little like <UNK> at an idiot <UNK> when he <UNK> his orange juice all over the <UNK> yes one says to <UNK> he is an idiot and yet when he's on top of his game he is also a true <UNK> the same is true for the informer which is on occasion very dreadful indeed and yet it boasts splendid photography some fine acting a wonderful score and a good decent simple story in the end which i won't give away politics religion and psychology come together in a church in such a way as to make the scene seem corny and over the top and yet so is life sometimes <UNK> people of simple faith behave differently from us presumably brilliant modern folks and the scene isn't so much unbelievable i buy it but i know the irish as embarrassing yet people do behave that way they do say things like that not everyone is hip and it may not even be <UNK> for everyone to be hip are people today so much superior to those of <UNK> or <UNK> years ago and in what way i don't think so we're just different now go watch the movie
<START> beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen <UNK> capturing such a <UNK> plain happiness in her work and the <UNK> of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious according to harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look bettie page saw the movie at hugh <UNK> house she is now <UNK> three with the producers there but not the director in case it got awkward if she didn't like it she apparently did like it up until the official <UNK> which she found unsettling some great costumes too the idea for the movie started in 1993 but this was worth the wait the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of dreadful movies that many of us will have already seen it would make an interesting companion piece with <UNK> and <UNK> but much more pleasant viewing

<START> this film deserves another bad review consider one reviewer <UNK> the film's virtues that include <UNK> sex violence or gore ' uh excuse me the very set up of the film has us watching as <UNK> young <UNK> with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless bloody body and given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which <UNK> <UNK> persona is <UNK> from viewer memory br br sans any family of his own cody like john rambo <UNK> the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the <UNK> of some place called <UNK> city no mention no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to <UNK> some <UNK> away from the death and destruction of war this explains as none seem to notice or care <UNK> obvious <UNK> effect it is not bad acting it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder not guessing here remember his co ordered him off the battle field br br how about that <UNK> kiss as noted by another review the fall was an accident the kiss was not how exactly was cody <UNK> faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for now that was a non family value moment a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube of course <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> as well as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the <UNK> season all cheering their <UNK> hearts and lips br br we know little about <UNK> fiancé except that she <UNK> her love for him she takes no longer than a <UNK> second to accept his <UNK> could have waited if any second thoughts he is generous he loves her to death the family has nothing really against him he believes marriage is based on <UNK> and the two have never discussed post marriage plans no evil <UNK> here br br <UNK> is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like <UNK> love you son ' <UNK> are part of our <UNK> literally days after they have met a stranger named cody and the <UNK> of <UNK> speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field br br bottom line this film is <UNK> candy <UNK> fluff that betrays itself in major ways most grossly when it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for by re defining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full <UNK> loving member of the family because we all <UNK> you ' how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that not
<START> a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a 10 10 i would highly recommend people to watch this movie
<START> this british pot <UNK> has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking the older men are <UNK> right wing <UNK> whose behavior brings back all the <UNK> of the reagan <UNK> years young or old however morals in this three part mini series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well br br nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of <UNK> it is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier nick comes to london with a friend whose father <UNK> is a rich conservative politician and <UNK> his sister cat while the family <UNK> in the south of france they neglect to inform him that when upset cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen <UNK> nick mistakes their self serving <UNK> for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and <UNK> him inexplicably nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point it's best not to question it br br while nick is most pleasing to look at he is <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> to rich <UNK> soon had me climbing the walls deeply <UNK> except to cat she <UNK> his big secret on sight he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay though it hardly seems possible nick takes a lover who is even more <UNK> than he br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the <UNK> which <UNK> forth when <UNK> sexual <UNK> is reported in a <UNK> <UNK> in true <UNK> fashion has become involved in several personal and financial <UNK> so the revelations about nick add to his embarrassment this gives <UNK> one final opportunity to <UNK> <UNK> the hapless boy br br except for one brief moment of <UNK> nick takes the abuse <UNK> upon him in silence and <UNK> <UNK> denial self loathing <UNK> or ignorance you decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set
<START> i live in salt lake city and i'm not a mormon so why did i rent this movie well because i live in <UNK> and thought it'd be nice to see locations i know in a film i really knew going into it that i wasn't going to get the inside jokes so i wasn't surprised when i sat with the deer in the <UNK> stare what i was surprised at was the <UNK> non mormon actions that were placed in this film br br i know it's a mormon film <UNK> to the members of the lds church but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn't of their faith every non mormon which wasn't many <UNK> <UNK> and had an amazing <UNK> attitude why br br that really <UNK> me off about this film they made the <UNK> so pure yet the rest of the state of <UNK> i guess is filled with punk <UNK> just because they don't follow the <UNK> of the lds church br br i can understand having the plots <UNK> around all lds members but you'd think salt lake city was 100 mormon which isn't even close to being the truth and as i said the non <UNK> in the movie were portrayed as drunken <UNK> please br br i guess i just don't get it because i don't belong to their faith and i guess i never will

<START> spoilers br br well the one line summary says it all <UNK> le samurai is the original and there are elements of leon and they are better much better br br in the samurai <UNK> <UNK> is a lonely warrior professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs with so much suspense in these scenes even the end is exactly the same the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand the world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it br br <UNK> is not killing so many people like the ghost dog but i guess <UNK> liked leon very much or even <UNK> by rodriguez so he added this too and let me guess the girl will become a professional like ghost dog like natalie portman in leon br br so what was <UNK> thinking after all where is the unique the original thought in this movie br br i <UNK> see the point in making <UNK> celluloid copies br br a 4 10 rating by <UNK> connor
<START> warning possible spoiler br br if you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a <UNK> helping of outrageously campy melodrama surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped off several times over the years although it's hard to <UNK> any filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama neither one of the <UNK> women can act here although <UNK> has improved over the years anne <UNK> offers the only touch of class as a <UNK> attorney and chris sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the <UNK> smarmy bad guy of the piece br br veteran director <UNK> johnson can't make a <UNK> purse out of this <UNK> ear of a script which is stuffed to <UNK> with <UNK> bad dialogue and outlandish situations for example the final sequence where <UNK> grabs her shotgun and chases sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but <UNK> <UNK> chuckles instead add a <UNK> shrill and <UNK> musical score by michel <UNK> and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you're likely to feel <UNK> and needing a hot shower after viewing it don't say you weren't warned
<START> this movie kinda let me down it seemed a lot like the movie jaws when the hopper was telling the mayor to close parks was like when roy <UNK> was telling the mayor to close the <UNK> they both said no way its summer but the box says hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one but he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting i'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case they just say lets do police work and we'll solve it and whats up with all the old men with pool <UNK> i didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses and then the guy who was <UNK> the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer with his hundred dollar <UNK> and that he thinks his <UNK> k is the size of a <UNK> come on what <UNK> lines i thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies i got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new i suggest you skip this movie oh and it was funny seeing the <UNK> above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee
<START> i went to the movies to see <UNK> <UNK> it wasn't bad it was <UNK> neat <UNK> <UNK> was a flick that i didn't mind but when it came to <UNK> i drew the line word to your mother br br want me to stop br br that's just a small <UNK> of the <UNK> fly style of <UNK> on display in this waste of film and location <UNK> this movie is seriously <UNK> thats 80s speak for just f <UNK> awful as an <UNK> mario van <UNK> is one hell of an actor and as an actor mario van <UNK> is one hell of a <UNK> br br any film calling itself <UNK> had better deliver at that <UNK> highest standard of the time so why were 6 year olds rolling in the <UNK> even back in the day when standards were so <UNK> high to <UNK> low because this rap is weak so weak that not even b e t or comedy central will touch it with a 10 foot gold rope chain br br <UNK> rapture is <UNK> poetry next to this bit of dr <UNK> in the hood so don't be a <UNK> avoid this movie br br
<START> i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless i'm just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by stone and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is 48 and that michael douglas isn't in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show 2004 i might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was <UNK> in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006 it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on <UNK> but the two shows would be great companion pieces
<START> this was disappointing it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to <UNK> it fell flat maria <UNK> acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it she showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved <UNK> or her mother's story when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in <UNK> story there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isn't much the supposed parallel between <UNK> mixed romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as cliché as they come and failed miserably anyway the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish the climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable <UNK> in fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark it was very hard to care about any of them even little ruth everything with luis was a distraction why did she <UNK> him so when on the phone from the hotel there was no context or explanation whatever for that if every reference to him was removed it wouldn't be noticed br br a simple story made confusing by poor character development who was whose mother again weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting you could almost hear quiet on the set i started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then <UNK> a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene this was about as cold and <UNK> a movie as i have seen a terrible waste of a good story
<START> very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it john <UNK> plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept 64 <UNK> and <UNK> pieces the game <UNK> him as a person when he <UNK> a game he <UNK> the one thing that makes sense to him and john <UNK> expresses this in a beautiful fashion even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence it makes you wonder if there other <UNK> out there who <UNK> about the game i am sure they are if you are a chess <UNK> it won't hurt to watch it its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well it achieves its <UNK> unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel
<START> genie <UNK> <UNK> arrives in egypt to visit her <UNK> bible <UNK> <UNK> father william <UNK> and <UNK> the attention of a group of <UNK> led by a <UNK> of the marquis de <UNK> robert englund englund also plays de <UNK> in flashbacks <UNK> in his cell genie is led <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who rides around naked on a horse and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> who introduces her to <UNK> smoking which leads to a wild <UNK> featuring topless <UNK> dancers a woman <UNK> <UNK> sex on a snake an orgy and her father preaching in the background meanwhile black <UNK> cult members <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> and <UNK> throats when genie is slipped drugs in her tea she <UNK> de <UNK> hanging from a cross a gold painted woman in a <UNK> g string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes it's all because she's the reincarnation of de <UNK> lost love br br this typically sleazy harry alan towers production is redundant seedy and pretty senseless but the sets costumes cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there's always something going on br br score 3 out of 10
<START> lucky me i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas <UNK> flick from <UNK> entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you i've rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious <UNK> fly off the <UNK> and steal the title of <UNK> killer clown movie ever <UNK> from the <UNK> stupid full moon fiasco <UNK> i'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one from all <UNK> it was shot on <UNK> and it doesn't really <UNK> all that bad quality wise for digital but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts br br the story slight and cliche as it is goes as follows an executive ken <UNK> who also scripted and co produced with the director takes skeptical co worker tracy amanda watson and horny married couple mark and susan hank fields and chris buck along on a weekend <UNK> to a yawn secluded cabin 12 <UNK> from the nearest town on the way there they pick up a bitchy <UNK> <UNK> melissa <UNK> in a bar and end up at their destination where a <UNK> <UNK> tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same <UNK> area comes true when each of the profanity <UNK> pot <UNK> <UNK> disappears one by one with only <UNK> doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their <UNK> br br the killer clown doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box aside from being <UNK> <UNK> it basically spends an hour <UNK> around in the woods <UNK> up wood and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i cannot say enough bad things about the cast especially the two guys and the <UNK> chick who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or <UNK> at the most inappropriate times doesn't really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense originality intelligence general <UNK> or humor i could go on for days on how inept this film is how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is but i'll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way br br also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k serial insane clown killer it's currently <UNK> under its original title of grim weekend br br score 1 out of 10
<START> the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no <UNK> comedy to a point where it just got boring some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor br br there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script lena <UNK> was good looking as always br br i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse br br if you enjoy movies like <UNK> this movie might be worth taking a look at
<START> give me my money back give me my life back give me a bit of credit this movie was vomit worthy useless and time <UNK> what a waste of energy and totally pointless okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but give us a break next time just give me the money and let me spend it lost child mothers <UNK> blamed husband cliché yes get a life sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time my money and my being i would rather watch eggs cook no real explanation to why this happened prison why loss obvious but why acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a <UNK> how much did this movie make well this silly fool hired a copy enough said
<START> the animation in this re imagining of peter the wolf is excellent but at <UNK> minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter the <UNK> because everything moves at a <UNK> pace i couldn't even watch the film in one sitting i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torture br br save yourself 30 minutes do not watch this film and you will thank me br br i can only guess that the oscar <UNK> <UNK> only watched the first few minutes of the <UNK> unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning
<START> i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didn't it's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone <UNK> toned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in <UNK> cgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the <UNK> price wrong instead they call the <UNK> price named after an actual person called alfred <UNK> 'the noble <UNK> jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a <UNK> what were you and the others thinking ron
<START> roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as <UNK> i can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le <UNK> yet both parts of the <UNK> may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself included br br polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters <UNK> in <UNK> and himself in le <UNK> starting with some lack of self <UNK> soon to turn gradually into psychological <UNK> eventually <UNK> into an <UNK> physical <UNK> the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really <UNK> from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no <UNK> supernatural element here while horror movies allow for some kind of <UNK> be it cheap or more elaborate polanski <UNK> <UNK> us and if in his latter <UNK> the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats br br suspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations <UNK> <UNK> and fulfilling them not literally with people's nerves in my book rosemary's baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain <UNK> are in constant struggle the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character what's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully <UNK> paint <UNK> lure into being him
<START> the version of this film i saw was titled <UNK> rises from the <UNK> the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he's playing <UNK> in a church hall <UNK> he rises from his tomb when a stupid <UNK> i think he's a <UNK> as he's also played by naschy returns to his <UNK> home and <UNK> the <UNK> head and body which had been separated by by the <UNK> who executed him in an attempt to stop him er rising from the tomb br br obviously once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die like all good <UNK> <UNK> here has a lovely assistant this one's played by another spanish horror great the beautiful <UNK> line like practically every other woman in the film line <UNK> gets her <UNK> off there's a lot of nudity in this film and not just female we even get to see <UNK> <UNK> body which isn't a pretty sight i can tell you most of the film's sex angle is laughably gratuitous there's one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a <UNK> of the <UNK> young blonde they've possessed br br it's also pretty gory in places notably a <UNK> gordon lewis esquire moment where line <UNK> her hands into a man's chest to remove his heart br br the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end they're quickly scared off by a fire though and don't bother coming back which is a shame the scene where the zombies rise however is the film's most <UNK> inept moment it all happens in long shot and we haven't really got a clue what's happening until we see some figures <UNK> on from the distance there are several rubbish moments like this thanks largely to poor editing when a <UNK> falls under the hypnotic spell of <UNK> head there's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever br br all in all not a great horror film but entertaining enough of course the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces for all i know the original spanish version could be a masterpiece
<START> the books of james <UNK> taking readers to <UNK> places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for <UNK> <UNK> south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another <UNK> success <UNK> br br it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly i'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight that and a general no <UNK> policy with occupied peoples in general are at the <UNK> of this story about <UNK> romance br br <UNK> is a relevant film today the military has always <UNK> in to the personal lives of its <UNK> in ways no <UNK> <UNK> could get away with <UNK> in america at the time <UNK> was made there were still <UNK> laws on the books in many states today gays in the military is a big issue someone may one day do a <UNK> like film on that issue br br joshua logan was on familiar ground south pacific also had racism as a <UNK> of its plot with a sure hand logan assembled a great cast and <UNK> a beautiful story br br marlon brando patricia <UNK> james garner kent smith some of the <UNK> players do a fine job but the picture is stolen by the <UNK> here <UNK> <UNK> hits the mark beautifully as <UNK> love interest but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars red buttons and <UNK> <UNK> br br buttons is your <UNK> <UNK> man air force member he falls <UNK> in love with <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> they marry and the military <UNK> does everything they can to break them up they presume to know what's best for buttons and <UNK> buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career br br and <UNK> <UNK> oscar was the first one given to an oriental it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards <UNK> was starring on broadway in flower drum song i was <UNK> to see it on broadway it was the first broadway show i ever saw i still carry the memory of it br br that oscar <UNK> something else too our war with japan was really over and we saw in <UNK> a great nation with a proud tradition and culture br br <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a <UNK> theatre actor if <UNK> were done today logan would never get away with it but <UNK> is fine br br good location photography and a grand story this film should be <UNK> more often it has a great moral
<START> you're using the imdb br br you've given some <UNK> votes to some of your favourite films br br it's something you enjoy doing br br and it's all because of this fifty seconds one world ends another begins br br how can it not be given a ten i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight exactly how could the first film ever made be better for the record the long still opening shot is great <UNK> a superb <UNK> perfectly suited to the situation and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch all this within fifty seconds br br the word genius is often <UNK> br br this is genius
<START> i haven't read this book but all through the movie i was <UNK> with only one thought in my head this is so <UNK> i have never seen an author all of the intelligence and life behind the <UNK> of a novel translated so well to film this movie had the same <UNK> found in <UNK> novels the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes br br campbell was also a very <UNK> character portrayed perfectly by nick nolte he had all of the <UNK> of a <UNK> hero lack of concern for political boundaries ironic dark humor giving way to dumb <UNK> in response to stress and an <UNK> to push his version of reality on those around him br br overall i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie it was the same feeling i had reading <UNK> cradle my first <UNK> novel as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen he thought of that and he made it real and important yes he has nothing but army <UNK> white christmas albums so it goes

<START> in spite of its impressive cast and crew <UNK> <UNK> man <UNK> early and often the plot is <UNK> convoluted the actors sport bad accents and director robert altman's participation amounts to collecting a pay check once again he has assembled an impressive cast like woody allen everyone wants to work with altman that this time around to the letter is miscast but that's only part of the problem br br kenneth branagh is rick <UNK> a high powered georgia lawyer who in the film's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself <UNK> <UNK> by a mysterious <UNK> company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex husband and a loony dad with red <UNK> everywhere the <UNK> lawyer <UNK> on even managing to get his children in <UNK> way fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that's not enough there's a <UNK> thrown in for the ridiculous finale br br branagh plays <UNK> with a <UNK> and unconvincing southern accent running around in a <UNK> coat in all kinds of weather he's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going <UNK> bob downey jr is every bit as bad as a p i but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent robert duvall as the old man is boo <UNK> all <UNK> up en <UNK> than a bed bug serving some thick <UNK> of ham but at least his <UNK> is plausible the female leads <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hannah <UNK> <UNK> are lean <UNK> and <UNK> even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos <UNK> jordan are wooden with the few throw away lines they have br br in addition to paying little attention to his actors altman's <UNK> en scene dripping with spanish moss is murky and <UNK> his action scenes comic book it lacks his offbeat touches and observations he does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still wave in georgia that make a well done altman so unique unfortunately <UNK> man is altman at his worst even if the pay is the same
<START> the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two br br oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided but that may have been because the constraints of live television <UNK> me to not expect it i suppose i was thinking more <UNK> suit larry <UNK> than the producers were br br definitely not a pg 13 movie which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones br br i liked it but i doubt it will be a smash hit which is sad as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the <UNK> other snl <UNK> tend to
<START> street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire this is not a movie you just watch for fun it is not a comfortable experience although it does have some laugh out loud moments this is a movie you watch when you need food for thought br br to dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely this is not only a satire of song of the south it's also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people through this wild exaggeration the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly held beliefs really are br br if you're the sort of person who's willing to acknowledge the <UNK> of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds and if you're not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye this movie may be for you
<START> what is jamie foxx supposed to be funny does he really believe he is funny well it's funny watching his confidence in being funny the man has no identity whatsoever i mean you can immediately see who his <UNK> are denzel washington and martin lawrence because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies the only problem is that he does it bad uneven and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel with that macho s t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence the funny and clumsy silly comic there's no personal touch to all that i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell and i'm sure he has nothing to say personally he really is mr dull boy in person br br i was really hoping hollywood and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom like don cheadle for example but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that <UNK> the old
<START> when they killed off john <UNK> character they killed the show he was the vital part of the info structure you had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how they were poor they were black and they were living proof that if you have jesus and your family that nothing is too hard sure james would lose jobs and <UNK> would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way br br james was the strong male role model that earned the <UNK> and <UNK> the children florida was the strong lady that would everyone including james when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it the kids had personalities and <UNK> which made them important as a family unit their neighbor <UNK> was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family things were bright gritty funny and honest until they changed the course of the program james dies and <UNK> took over the show br br <UNK> was still mom thelma was <UNK> into a lady and michael was still the <UNK> midget but <UNK> was the show we were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment i guess <UNK> paycheck didn't do much for the family they were only threatened with <UNK> because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working i know that <UNK> <UNK> thelma and even michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real james worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame br br <UNK> was the comic relief but i felt the show need substance it's ok to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the <UNK> <UNK> show i mean really here was a guy that was failing in school he kept getting laid off and he painted for money in about two episodes james had always been there to encourage his talent but <UNK> and the rest of the family didn't seem to care br br why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do he could have sold <UNK> on the street or worked for people that print <UNK> and cards he did but something went wrong with that why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams i'll tell you why it was because they didn't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams the show stopped teaching us about growing building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases they should have kept james if any show needed a father it was that one
<START> <UNK> works for the department of public safety and his job is to check up on sex <UNK> sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex <UNK> i don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to <UNK> so along comes allison <UNK> is now training her to do his job and it's like job <UNK> allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn't realize how much danger she really is and it's all <UNK> fault he starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isn't to be a police officer br br it's a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his scope of practice <UNK> did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of allison it has some good mystery to it too and just when i had it figured out there was more to it
<START> this is an hybrid creature born at carl <UNK> mind with <UNK> the second generation <UNK> masters and <UNK> 23 into one miserable movie that have no logic the story is very very bad and you cannot forgive the action of <UNK> when have nothing to do with <UNK> if this movie have so high rank is for the tv series and not for itself i did said it the name cannot save this
<START> things i learned from the list br br a decent cinematographer a hot girl who can act and <UNK> mcdowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking br br blockbuster won't give you your money back br br even when he reads the script and says ugh really <UNK> mcdowell still tries br br chuck <UNK> desperately needs acting classes br br hire a writer br br jesus hates me too and <UNK> me by making me pay 5 50 to see this movie br br when making a movie you don't need an ending just leave everything unexplained <UNK> an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending genius br br any random <UNK> can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window so make friends br br your maid can sing you back to life br br chuck <UNK> still needs acting classes br br your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie br br apologies will not be accepted
<START> what a real treat and quite unexpected this is what a real thriller movie is all about i rushed into the video shop grabbed a movie without reading the entire <UNK> on the back and hoped for the best i was totally surprised and delighted i really enjoyed the actors and their characters i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic the plot was well thought out well written and directed it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single minute br br i highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention definitely a 10 out of 10 from me
<START> this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it as the credits rolled the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film br br yes it was formulaic and predictable but that somehow added to it's charm the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling <UNK> in few productions br br a real feel good film <UNK> throughout with outstanding music when it's released i'll buy it
<START> i loved this movie and will watch it again original twist to plot of man vs man vs self i think this is kurt <UNK> best movie his eyes conveyed more than most actors words perhaps there's hope for mankind in spite of government <UNK>
<START> if you enjoy <UNK> all the british <UNK> humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely hilarious br br arthur lowe is a real treat br br i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated br br perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously br br i can't believe it is now only available in the us <UNK> of course and not in uk where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour
<START> i don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions i <UNK> the first season br br unfortunately this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers god <UNK> anybody actually go to law school based on these shows which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show it just made me gag a bit br br that aside <UNK> and shatner who are supposed to be the stars of the show are the most annoying while this might be a compliment in some situations it's certainly not here their constantly <UNK> the women on the show is funny at first but since that's what they're doing literally all the time i've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get trying to <UNK> some serious dramatic and even tear <UNK> moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the <UNK> loss of interest i've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show br br alan <UNK> flamboyant and gratuitous public service <UNK> where he <UNK> off his opinions do not impress <UNK> <UNK> is just annoying i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for <UNK> speech wearing a colonial outfit br br i'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care br br i think the show's writers became aware that the sexual <UNK> displayed by <UNK> and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more <UNK> of them from the start the thing is i don't care if the sexual <UNK> treatment in the show is done well but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with <UNK> <UNK> sexual <UNK> all over the show in the hopes that my <UNK> will keep me coming back for more i'm not a teenager anymore and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn't to <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> to get ratings br br of course i'm writing this after i realized that it's really not gonna get much better than this it's a shame because it's one of those shows i'd love to love
<START> why did it sound like the husband kept calling her <UNK> it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 proper <UNK> and <UNK> are essential to a film br br it was very <UNK> what with all the skin ripping though i <UNK> how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital <UNK> to the body the biggest <UNK> actually and without we would die the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining br br i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre br br 6 10 come on <UNK> get your english up to par
<START> with these people <UNK> so many shots using old footage and <UNK> animals to get them out not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors what's to believe old film of countries is nice but the animal abuse and <UNK> of natives is painful to watch in these films i know racism is ok in these old films but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility portrayed as <UNK> they never flew their planes martin johnson was an ex <UNK> used friends like jack london for financial gain while <UNK> them of <UNK> denying his wife's apparent depression using her as a cute prop all this makes these films unbearable they were by no means the first to travel to these lands or the first to write about them he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer but that's about it
<START> while this movie isn't a classic by any stretch it is very entertaining as i remember it i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed arthur and though it isn't as funny as that movie it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with arthur
<START> this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized there are two <UNK> to take in horror films either you don't really explain what's going on or who the killer is like in texas chainsaw massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of this br br unfortunately creep fails in this area i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation no character is fully realized although the <UNK> nature of <UNK> character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story br br in the end this story is mostly <UNK> and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film making that drag down the film br br this film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have <UNK> from a serious face lift br br creep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment but sadly that's about it
<START> why didn't <UNK> have any pants where did they go it was never explained that's why this movie was so awesome plus <UNK> gave his kids the aids great acting too richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor a i d s my favorite line from the movie was that hit the spot a i d s this movie was for the birds i tried to give this movie the <UNK> but it continued playing what am i doing wrong i thought the <UNK> was <UNK> lol i would like that for a show why wasn't <UNK> wearing pants i know his arm was <UNK> but what's up with those crazy <UNK> <UNK> why didn't that family <UNK> guy ray combs get a net he could have used one <UNK>
<START> there was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film <UNK> <UNK> but even her looks couldn't stop me from voting it the lowest possible one br br the plot is bad and irrational br br what more can i say the movie sucks
<START> well overall this movie was pretty much worthless and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy i just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie this definitely wasn't what we were looking for but it satisfied us for humor the actors in this movie especially brandon are so fake that it's funny and especially that tracy girl whenever she's in the <UNK> up room telling the clown to go away they show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting and also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs mark he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him and seriously would you just be <UNK> if you were being chased down i'd be <UNK> for my life even though anyone could probably <UNK> that clown because he's like 300 <UNK> not to mention that the effects aren't that great like whenever the clown chops off <UNK> head in the forest then whenever he throws her head into the <UNK> up room with denise and tracy whenever denise throws the head back over also like in the previous guy's comment the beginning makes absolutely no sense and i don't even see why it was even included in the movie so what was this movie made in 2003 the music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's and the camera ing doesn't even really look professional half of the time it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be overall i'd have to say i enjoyed the movie i wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of i'd recommend it for sure
<START> by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather <UNK> disturbing you know the type funny but supposed to <UNK> you this was not funny or horrific the writing was lame the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme <UNK> they were so expected the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good script at least i hope that wasn't their best watch this movie at your own risk i give it negative 3 stars outta 10
<START> there's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this lady death the motion picture just plain sucks aside from the fact that the main character is a well <UNK> blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional <UNK> of graphic violence the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980's cartoon based on a line of action figures the bad guy himself even talks like a <UNK> wannabe has the obligatory inept henchman and lives in a <UNK> that looks to have been <UNK> after the <UNK> of the villain from the old saturday morning <UNK> cartoon just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes <UNK> bad dialogue at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to <UNK> yet there is no sex no <UNK> rape thank goodness and very little sex appeal this despite the physical appearance of the title character there is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half naked heroine and bloody deaths essentially what we have here is a feature length episode of she <UNK> princess of power but with <UNK> clothes and more gore
<START> getting to work on this film when it was made back in the summer of 1990 shot partly in the <UNK> estate in <UNK> <UNK> and the remaining parts in winston <UNK> the massive <UNK> of the <UNK> reynolds were used in several office scenes and places in around the beautiful city that is know as the <UNK> capital of the world winston <UNK> i enjoyed my work although it was exceedingly hard work building all the sets like the golf of mexico where <UNK> russo and jim belushi went on their date i also had a big hand in <UNK> the bar where larry encounters the magical bartender mr destiny i tacked all those <UNK> on the wall of sports heroes and <UNK> that phone booth where larry makes a phone call for a cab i even put my mothers photo at eye level so i could freeze frame it and show it to her when we watched it i remember <UNK> the grass at his old house with green <UNK> because it first had to be <UNK> it was a new house in a new development and i guess they <UNK> it for the movie then i had to cut that newly laid <UNK> to make it look nice man that was hard as far as the movie when we made it we had no idea what it would be like but after seeing it i fell in love with it because really tells the story of what if as good as i ever had seen it including the great it's a wonderful life i cried so many times br br i can't count i got to meet the wonderful actor michael caine while shooting scenes at an old minor league <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> scenes were played and <UNK> i remember after he had done a take an was heading back to his trailer i ran him down and asked him for a picture and he was quite <UNK> and said why not he is a good guy and a really natural and <UNK> actor i can't say the same for jim belushi he was so full of himself smoking big cuban <UNK> and talking <UNK> so br br everyone in <UNK> could hear his every word his career never did take off but he has had a decent tv career recently i would say watch this movie if you ever get the chance it's wonderful and really heartfelt and real you can feel <UNK> pain after he enters into the new world mr destiny gives him after hitting the homer and as he wants so badly for people to believe he is not this bad guy everyone thinks he is they all think he belongs in a <UNK> but eventually he wins people over but by then he wants his real life back so badly especially his wonderful wife played so beautifully by linda hamilton and he wants his dog back so see it
<START> this movie is not great but it is a good and enjoyable one it feels like an indie film made out of a play script morgan freeman basically plays himself although the director <UNK> the script was not written for him and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet i mean he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it br br i found the dialogue a bit too positive for my taste but refreshing nonetheless this is a film that <UNK> the viewer to take a look at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go a bit too much emphasis on appearance if you ask me br br bottom line a nice little film made in two weeks with basically two actors and a few extras dialogue driven makes morgan freeman look good
<START> this movie is totally wicked it's really great to see <UNK> in a different role than her sabrina character the plot is totally cool and the characters are excellently written definitely one of the best movies
<START> i can say nothing more about this movie than man this sucks if you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain watch this movie it's the best cure in the world for taking away happiness when i started watching this film i was completely happy <UNK> i could feel my brain melting like it was struck by <UNK> <UNK> god i hate that stupid dinosaur so if you want severe brain damage watch this movie it will do the trick
<START> i really liked batman dead end i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance <UNK> could make a fine film this trailer didn't quite give me the same impression the story line or potential story line was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show br br first michael <UNK> is not that good a superman i actually thought he in his brief appearance made a decent clark kent sorry i just don't think of superman as being that buff the suit kent wore masked his size batman may have the body of a <UNK> but not superman <UNK> is toned no doubt but not bulk anyway i didn't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed <UNK> now this may not be just <UNK> fault <UNK> may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction br br second the special effects for flying were <UNK> superman flies through the sky if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground with the <UNK> <UNK> and buildings visible above him i don't think there were any full body shots of superman flying evidently the <UNK> and <UNK> supporting <UNK> must have been located on his lower <UNK> br br all in all it was a good trailer i'd probably pay to see a film if ever made and would be sure to catch it on television the story line an alliance between <UNK> and wayne <UNK> superman jealous of <UNK> attraction to wayne lex and <UNK> <UNK> to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman superman is a good one i'm sure with a larger budget and <UNK> for a full film <UNK> and company even <UNK> could deliver a decent film certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately
<START> i grew up watching the old inspector gadget cartoon as a kid it was like get smart for kids bumbling <UNK> can't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog brain and his niece penny i had heard the live action movie was decent so i checked it out at the library i rented this movie for free and felt i should have been paid to see this br br <UNK> comes nowhere near the caliber of acting don adams had as the voice of gadget his voice was all wrong the girl who played penny looked nothing like the cartoon penny she is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with <UNK> but she does do a decent job given what she had to work with <UNK> coleman gives a good performance as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he never <UNK> in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him <UNK> by gadget br br the gadget mobile was wrong it never talked in the series and it did fine why did they do this br br gadget was too intelligent in this film in the show he was a complete idiot here he had a halfway decent intellect it would have worked better if he was a moron br br also the completely butchered the <UNK> <UNK> says <UNK> it is and should always be <UNK> it sounds lame with out the <UNK> i got upset when they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase br br the only decent gags were during the credits the <UNK> for claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen <UNK> <UNK> in the audience is mr t richard <UNK> aka jaws of bond movie fame a <UNK> <UNK> look alike <UNK> <UNK> and more this is about the only part i laughed at br br the other is at the end where penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say <UNK> don adams voices the dog saying that brain isn't in right now please leave your name at the sound of the <UNK> <UNK> of course this isn't laugh out loud funny just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear adams in the movie he should have at least voiced the stupid car br br kids will like this anyone over 13 won't br br
<START> when i was a kid we always used to be <UNK> and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema this is one of the films we watched this is one of the stupidest films i've ever seen i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film a martian is dropped on earth turns into a human befriends a human and is trying everything he can to get back home but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors back to the <UNK> christopher lloyd as the martian uncle martin dumb and <UNK> jeff daniels as tim o'hara elizabeth <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hannah as <UNK> but apart from that it's complete crap poor
<START> this reminds me of when i was a born again believer who was going to be a minister i never actually thought i would be a minister or even graduate from high school because i was almost positive i would be <UNK> to heaven before that would ever happen that was before i discovered that christianity was a bunch rubbish i am now an <UNK> and that just proves that the once saved always saved <UNK> that christians tell us is no more real than <UNK> if it were true then why did i leave after many years of being a <UNK> born again believer yes i really was saved i <UNK> that silly <UNK> <UNK> with all my heart br br if christians were to read their bible they would discover that their god thinks like rape <UNK> abortion and many other atrocities are alright according to him they might be surprised to learn that no where is the word rapture mentioned
<START> first and foremost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen as a character that's supposed to be a hip village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious why is he so hyper over dramatic and plain horrible did he know anything about his character before they started filming did the director don't the martial arts teach discipline aside from that this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor hand in toilet i <UNK> i masturbation hmm i fast times at <UNK> high i i american pie i the list goes on bad dialogue in one sequence eric says it's none of my business i but i and 30 seconds later <UNK> says why is this any of your business bad editing at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots <UNK> it's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight <UNK> group of friends in any world i can't comment on what makes everyone laugh but if you enjoy low brow basic bathroom humor and insults by all means enjoy if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines see i <UNK> i if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy go for i the <UNK> of steve i but anyone who thinks i whipped i is witty and an accurate portrayal dating well i cannot agree at all
<START> this has the <UNK> jokes out of all the cheech chong flicks it's the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this isn't gut <UNK> funny it has its moments but not as funny as there's something about mary check it out anyway i'm sure you'll laugh unless your an anti drug <UNK> or something
<START> the name <UNK> of the main character is the german word for woman i don't know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some <UNK> from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year when it was shown br br but those were the only <UNK> the movie got not that it was aiming for <UNK> it's a horrible movie for <UNK> sake a horrible movie in more than one meaning it's a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer <UNK> not for the faint of heart and it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown i'm not even going into a moral <UNK> because movies don't really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years
<START> i saw this show about 3 4 years ago it was <UNK> funny when i first time i saw it was playing on <UNK> <UNK> television and i started to like it too bad that that show is on bad time for me hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing frank sinatra and he comes on stupid ideas he got these glasses which h are brown i like it and there's <UNK> the group <UNK> we all know what he does when his alone he wants to get laid badly he even had it with his boss in one episode his from india and there is michael the stupidest guy on whole group probably stupidest in town and his a cop he is so stupid that i remember follows hyde says did u called cops no michael comes in and says does anyone know how to turn off <UNK> he is a town playboy then comes jackie who is former girlfriend of michael and then she's <UNK> girlfriend then is eric who's son of grumpy war veteran and son of kitty the housewife his one big <UNK> but he loves donna his girlfriend with who they plan for they're marriage donna is one hot girl hmm what i forget ah hyde lives in a basement
<START> if i could give it a zero i'd change my mind and give it a 10 instead absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot doesn't make sense of what is happening just plain boring please don't waste your money on this one <UNK> this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story but <UNK> i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3 4 times than watch this crap i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well zodiac killer should be called <UNK> <UNK> instead
<START> thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey john carpenter and tommy lee wallace this movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic the first vampires was fun but this low budget <UNK> makes me yawn br br jon bon <UNK> the poor man's kevin bacon drives around mexico with a <UNK> <UNK> a hidden <UNK> holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio <UNK> guitar case in <UNK> he picks up some lame hunters along the way including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes <UNK> to keep from turning into a vampire and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no <UNK> and so we could care less about her or her quest to walk in the <UNK> by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so if you've seen the first vampires you've already seen this and done much better br br john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately frankly i think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic the only decent film he's done since they live 1987 is vampires everything else is complete crap right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars and now this waste of celluloid where are more <UNK> like assault on <UNK> 13 halloween 1 escape from new york and the thing br br carpenter <UNK> wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper thin script packed with <UNK> <UNK> and recycled gags from the original did i mention i hated every character in the movie there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it not even the dvd presentation is good the menu looks awful br br by comparison jason x friday the 13th in space was a masterpiece now that is how you make a sequel and re <UNK> a franchise ladies and <UNK> as well as create an exciting dvd menu
<START> sadly i don't remember the book anymore but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace this film represents a typical german production of low quality it does not hold my attention although the story itself is good it is just badly <UNK> at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly <UNK> and exaggerated they have no nuances in their performances even the well known and liked german actors <UNK> <UNK> and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle however there's hope i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon
<START> do you guys wanna know a secret this movie sucks well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be <UNK> by <UNK> versions of original movies then perhaps you may find this movie astounding this movie being a <UNK> copy of i know what you did last summer the first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting a bunch of so called cool teenagers <UNK> their vacation in florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the <UNK> they are the only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in <UNK> a pretentious sense of adolescent <UNK> within the characters the second half hour of the movie <UNK> a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no where near <UNK> killings the third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further <UNK> myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show as far as the story is concerned it can easily be explained in a few lines a bunch of teenagers go to florida on vacation while they are busy <UNK> they slowly and i mean slowly begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret the only thread to the killings is that all victims were <UNK> of a common high school one thing that did however <UNK> me about this movie was how much betty im not sure about her name the blonde character looks like reese <UNK> another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times does that make it a work of art absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she <UNK> me when i was just about to go through the guest room door whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece br br do you wanna know a secret i'm not sure about you guys but i don't
<START> a family mother patricia <UNK> father jake <UNK> son <UNK> per sullivan go out for a family get together in some remote house in the middle of winter they accidentally hit a deer while driving there this <UNK> some of the locals especially <UNK> john <UNK> and things slowly very slowly go wrong br br i was expecting the worst when i started watching this the bulk of the reviews for this on this site are extremely negative well i disagree first off it's not a horror film the horror doesn't even begin until the closing 30 minutes it plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in on that level it's pretty damn good br br first the bad stuff the pace is way too slow jake <UNK> is a horrible actor way too many false dream sequence scares the wendigo barely figures into the film and the clear view we get of the wendigo at the end is laughable br br the good stuff pretty good dramatic script <UNK> is excellent as the mother some great direction with eerie sound effects which are a little scary a pretty explicit hot sex sequence between <UNK> and <UNK> which actually is necessary for the integrity of the plot pretty good acting by sullivan only 10 at the time and <UNK> and a completely unexpected tragic ending br br i think many people are annoyed with this film because it's being pushed as a horror film which it isn't so if you can ignore that i think you might like it i'm giving it a 7
<START> sixth <UNK> for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in <UNK> now he wants to <UNK> his <UNK> and spoiler needs a family member in order to do it br br a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all works better as a dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many <UNK> that's for sure the actors aren't interesting save robert englund as always and an obviously <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and there are simply far too many visual effects the finale is ok but doesn't provide as many sparks as i think one might hope br br in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story it provides englund the opportunity to do more non makeup scenes than ever before br br there are cameos worth noting a joint cameo by then couple <UNK> and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shock rocker alice cooper and a funny cameo by johnny <UNK> that also sort of <UNK> the pop icon that he had become br br film debut of <UNK> meyer who plays spencer br br one of the best things about it is the <UNK> of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits br br 4 10
<START> it has been said a city on hill cannot hide itself and virginia city <UNK> <UNK> on the side of <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> west of <UNK> is a prime example or in the context of the movie should be virginia city <UNK> in the american dream as a shower of gold and silver <UNK> the same year the civil war began it was the <UNK> of the dean of american letters it was where a young reporter named samuel <UNK> began using the name mark <UNK> and went on to become america's most famous writer it was also the <UNK> of the great <UNK> fortune and the <UNK> pad of john <UNK> who became the <UNK> man in america the third <UNK> man in the world hey they should have made the movie about him in the <UNK> virginia city was the <UNK> of all <UNK> the home of the big bonanza at one time the largest <UNK> area west of st louis and east of san francisco but virginia city the movie misses all that and is more about a <UNK> north south <UNK> between the characters played by errol flynn and randolph scott flynn is capt <UNK> <UNK> a union officer who is a <UNK> in a concentration camp run by a mean <UNK> commander named capt vance <UNK> played by scott these two are always getting in each other's way <UNK> escapes and then tries to stop a <UNK> of gold <UNK> being <UNK> out of <UNK> by who else other than <UNK> hey what's he doing here horrible bogart plays a laughable mexican <UNK> who can't decide who's side he's on <UNK> hopkins plays a murky character named julia <UNK> obviously a historical <UNK> at the town's first lady julia <UNK> who in real life a celebrated prostitute she goes to washington and talks honest <UNK> about saving <UNK> not <UNK> from hanging and blah blah blah go figure they <UNK> hung the writer in real life <UNK> reports that on the last day of the war the setting sun caused the american flag <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to appear to the puzzled residents to be <UNK> on fire kind of like the movie three days later they discovered that on that day the south <UNK> one interesting <UNK> in the film is how <UNK> alan hale and <UNK> williams flick their <UNK> forward when they shoot like they're fishing or trying to make the bullets go faster not a bad idea for the movie the same kind of <UNK> is <UNK> over <UNK> and corn throughout the movie gosh how could they miss the gold madness <UNK> wealth gun battles in the silver mines mark <UNK> getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown the crooked <UNK> the opera house fire <UNK> ward <UNK> huge funeral the chinese <UNK> the black <UNK> the <UNK> all this high on a mountain surrounded by desert the truth was unreal did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great american holocaust well if you count this movie it wouldn't be the first <UNK> to come out of virginia city it's a disappointment for virginia city fans because it misses what made the town a city of <UNK> where it is said evil <UNK> out of the ground okay other than that it's a fun movie flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they're destroying if flynn would just play his rotten self i'd double my rating
<START> i have read the book and i must say that this movie stays true to form i think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of psycho <UNK> raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and burgess meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next door neighbor i have seen this movie at least twice and i think that i am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection the suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming if you like movies like signs and the village the sentinel will be a classic <UNK> also what is interesting is the actors in the movie you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits the late jerry <UNK> is great as the commercial director and jeff goldblum is excellent as the photographer also there is beverly <UNK> who is underrated but great
<START> though a bit more polished technically than the previous film in the series <UNK> <UNK> escapes this is a weaker <UNK> in both a plot that's less thrilling and a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of ray <UNK> br br that said several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying also john barrymore is present popping up all through the film in a variety of outlandish <UNK> br br anyway it's another endless night for <UNK> as he and his <UNK> chase around trying to rescue the poor girl he <UNK> to marry the clues are stupid but again the supporting actors often make them entertaining
<START> watching this again recently i found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen even if the <UNK> budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure by any objective measure this was a disaster but i found it easy to imagination how good a lord of the rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers unfortunately thanks to jackson that will not be possible for a long time br br watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all then this story simply couldn't be stuffed up fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film there were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that peter jackson did it although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution the way they tried to show the <UNK> world from <UNK> point of view for example or the way that <UNK> showed sam what was happening back home for another br br another thing i really appreciated in this version the silent moments there were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back drop compare that to the <UNK> <UNK> camera of the jackson films and the <UNK> score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched jackson's films were full of their own importance this was <UNK> and a lot more modest br br jackson and co hit this with more than us <UNK> million dollars in production costs at least 90 million dollars more for marketing a massive tax break from the <UNK> government and also gained massive <UNK> from filming in <UNK> not the usa however despite the marketing claims the intention to be faithful was never there this is well documented <UNK> <UNK> said as much in an interview when she said they deliberately didn't re read the books before writing the script jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film along the lines of the lord of the rings and that the one he really wanted to do was return of the king because it had a lot of battles but no character development br br in contrast this film tried to be more true of course a lot of things were wrong the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything and the pace was too fast naturally they cut a lot and adapted other scenes and for this they deserve credit while jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway there's actually a curious similarity between the structure of the jackson and bakshi films near the beginning in that they both <UNK> from the original books in the same way although of course some of this could be coincidence br br this was not a good film but the potential was there bakshi said in an interview to the <UNK> <UNK> club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice his version didn't work but he might have been right
<START> but lets face it it got a few nostalgic <UNK> out of me br br the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few <UNK> i get a new season and just power through them like i have 2 days to live i like the idea of <UNK> it up but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following br br dr cox isn't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes only explanation i can think of is they changed the <UNK> of the episodes or had to re shoot the beginning br br and that my friends is why the hell cox is bald br br anyways the show is awesome bring on the <UNK> season
<START> world's finest is an unique project it's a trailer for a superman batman <UNK> movie that doesn't exists and will also never exists at least not in this form with these characters actors and plot line anyway br br so the movie is one big <UNK> even more than standards everyday real movie trailers the trailer will hype you all up for nothing in that regard i really didn't liked this short project when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad and perhaps you'll even feel cheated afterward when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place surely to show off sandy <UNK> skills but couldn't he had also done this with a real movie short like his earlier movie batman dead end br br but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is so from a movie technical point of view it's a really great one it's great looking and way more professional than you'll perhaps at first would expect although the people who've already seen batman dead end will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets cheap <UNK> costumes and third rate actors the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget wasn't sky high but for most part it's very impressive and professional looking with nice costumes sets special effects cinematography and lighting br br the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey it works well for the trailer style it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones mainly the superman flying sequences it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car with a camera aimed at him from an angle below i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this br br michael <UNK> seemed like a pretty good superman clark kent although he obviously isn't the greatest talented actor around clark <UNK> <UNK> his batman role well again and kurt <UNK> seemed like an awesome lex luthor the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough br br it's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern <UNK> of the two main <UNK> of this movie in the movies batman begins and superman returns it's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one it's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt <UNK> does sound like kevin spacey the actor who played lex luthor in superman returns br br it's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more even though you know that there won't be more whatever happened to the <UNK> bros plans to create an actual full length superman batman movie by the way i thought that developments were <UNK> for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made batman begins and superman returns br br 7 10
<START> i love cinema so what i'm about to confess <UNK> me deeply i had given a thumbs down to che parts 1 and 2 without having seen the film terrible i know but i felt into a trap <UNK> by who i don't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and no matter how smart i think i am i fell into it but thankfully i <UNK> into an <UNK> film director martin <UNK> a man i love and admire when i told him i wasn't going to see it because i knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and <UNK> is a <UNK> he took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why i went to see both parts straight away and che part 1 and 2 is the best film i've seen in 2008 it is of such <UNK> that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past the regard for its audience is something that we're not used to anymore i don't know if we ever were riveting moving without <UNK> and <UNK> del toro is just extraordinary we can see his soul we can actually perceive it the humanity of the man is overwhelming so thank you martin <UNK> once again for <UNK> me so honestly bravo del toro bravo soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film don't commit the mistake i was about to commit go see it now on the big screen
<START> i agree with the majority of the comments i have seen written i grew up watching <UNK> street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born i was born in 1964 so i was 5 <UNK> old when <UNK> street was introduced to television the show taught me my numbers the count spelling the muppet and about life i liked all the old characters big bird oscar <UNK> and cookie monster and don't quite understand why they had to change i understand that everything has to change in some way but to make cookie monster into a <UNK> monster to promote healthy eating the show has introduced new characters and monsters since it's <UNK> why not make a separate <UNK> monster that talks <UNK> the benefits of eating a varied <UNK> with cookie monster but back to my point i grew up watching the very beginning of <UNK> street my now 20 <UNK> old daughter grew up watching ss with me along side her and we discussed mr hooper dying although he had died prior to her being born as well as other topics on the show i saw the episode as a older child and still remember how well they portrayed the event much like real life and i'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and <UNK> effect families you saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events the show has talked about traditional families <UNK> families and combined families it's one of the few shows that actually <UNK> these scenarios i now have a 5 <UNK> old daughter who really doesn't watch ss i've tried to watch the show a couple of times but it really is not what it used to be the <UNK> 1 2 <UNK> with mr <UNK> is absolutely ridiculous like many people have said it doesn't teach anything it's <UNK> for the less than 18 month old maybe and isn't even funny i always <UNK> myself on watching ss as a child teen and adult with my own child now on my second go round i really have a hard time watching ss the topics that were discussed death marriage non traditional families new to <UNK> moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2 99 year old to understand and relate to now there are no concepts taught minimal counting only the occasional mention of the <UNK> it is not the same ss from an original watcher of the show please if any producers from the show read these comments return the show to its foundation new concepts have never been a problem with ss they just used to have a better way to <UNK> them into the show
<START> with ralph bakshi most of his films appear to be like two edged swords you'll get something awesome out of it but only if you put up with the silly and the unnecessarily <UNK> the lord of the rings was a great adaptation of the story which perhaps didn't always shine in the animation department br br fire and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view the <UNK> is a lot more detailed and the animation has a vibrant look to it you still get some of the dull still cells and slightly <UNK> background paintings but on the over all the look has definitely gotten better since bakshi's last fantasy epic the animation has almost a realistic <UNK> style to it and unlike in lotr where this style was often at odds with the actual content here it enhances the film's unique atmosphere br br unfortunately the film fails to create a meaningful story out of its simple setting and in fact most of the characters' motivations are pretty <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are easy cases but even the main villain <UNK> was difficult to follow not to mention that guy with <UNK> face mask also known as just <UNK> <UNK> even though most of the voice actor's were appropriate there are some odd quirks in the audio department and <UNK> especially sounds really terrible whenever she's screaming br br however i believe the film's inherent entertainment value <UNK> its unnecessarily silly execution of the plot line the <UNK> clad of the characters is something you'll never get over but it helps you remind yourself that perhaps this film isn't even intended to be taken too seriously it's still a <UNK> cool and really funny
<START> saw this as previous viewer by accident i have watched it twice now i thoroughly enjoyed it no silly thought provoking messages just plain good fun entertainment good songs good characters and a just a feel good film highly recommended to those of us that just like to enjoy films and not <UNK> them great fun for all the family here i didn't realise <UNK> <UNK> is played by vanessa williams she is excellent and very <UNK> the songs like one boy and one last kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your feet to jason alexander is the complete contrast to his character in pretty woman <UNK> is very good <UNK> <UNK> still sticks in my mind from cagney and <UNK> and her voice and accent still had that <UNK> in it overall i just loved it and will be looking to purchase it if it is available
<START> i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work i say partly because most of his films fall into two categories brilliant and boring sadly this film falls into the later category br br this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film <UNK> moving castle an intriguing premise is set up but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some <UNK> events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it br br the first third of the film reveals the post apocalyptic world the story is set in and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold from then on things go down hill the middle part of the film is mostly made up of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> propaganda and the ending is heavily marred by the <UNK> on the kind of <UNK> <UNK> which ruins a large number of japanese animated films br br overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators what is left is something which is visually stunning although sadly the version i saw was an <UNK> generation copy with poor colour which gives rise to the common myth that <UNK> shows her bare bottom when flying but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused
<START> just another example of why <UNK> king's books should not be made into movies even carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen the premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a <UNK> who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman in court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical king ending the acting was stilted and felt forced we went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play king himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like dave barry which <UNK> my belief that authors should stay just that authors leave the acting to actors not that anyone in this movie was that great i've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better
<START> i watched this film alone in the dark and it was full moon outside i didn't do it in purpose it just happened in this way so all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me well it didn't in fact i wanted to shut off the dvd player after only 8 minutes but i thought come on give it a chance unfortunately i did the acting was awful the only one with some decent acting was <UNK> armstrong the plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before some scenes didn't make sense at all and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie the scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology yet some good movies were made back then i was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie i thought couldn't they put some money in this and make it decent i couldn't agree more with the ratings that the movie got it is also my rating for it 3 out of 10
<START> hilarious laugh out loud moments and yet not a comedy i particularly liked the planted gag of the <UNK> <UNK> the filthy bum who then shouts after them in anger you filthy <UNK> i mean wow someone's online degree in literature is paying off the worst script imaginable with plot <UNK> in an instant ridiculous movement in the story zero character development even between the characters who meet it's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years dodgy voice over with added echo effects and plot holes oh god are there plot holes to be honest i write this not even having watched the entire thing but i certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema thank god we've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of well use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence
<START> a lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80's music this <UNK> the 80's desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work personally i liked <UNK> and the other <UNK> characters they had some of the more amusing lines
<START> this is your standard musical comedy from the <UNK> with a big plus that it features some well known <UNK> actors in small fun <UNK> br br there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and <UNK> <UNK> overall kind of atmosphere with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it <UNK> it's a <UNK> <UNK> but i most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance when the main characters hit the hollywood studios br br of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines it's like watching a movie and getting a laurel hardy short with it for free also laurel hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james <UNK> without a mustache this time as the director of the short br br it's certainly true that all of the <UNK> and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character br br the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period though the rating on here would suggest otherwise br br 7 10
<START> after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of <UNK> and <UNK> for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only <UNK> one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the <UNK> taught us to do
<START> welcome to <UNK> is one of the most delightful films i have ever seen a superb ensemble cast tight editing and wonderful direction a caper movie that doesn't get <UNK> down in the standard tricks br br not much can be said about this film without spoiling it the tag line says it all 5 guys 1 safe no brains br br william h macy and sam <UNK> lead an amazing cast george clooney should be <UNK> for producing this gem br br
<START> the message of this movie is personality is more important than beauty <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to be the ugly <UNK> but the funny thing is that she's not at all ugly actually she's a lot more attractive than uma thurman the friend who looks like a model br br now would this movie work if the ugly <UNK> was really unattractive when will hollywood stop with this <UNK> br br in my opinion despite the message that it wants to convey this movie is simply ridiculous br br
<START> couldn't believe it <UNK> sentences good grief know what all true real people ever talk like this don't think so good girl <UNK> fellow <UNK> upper lip only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless <UNK> <UNK> seemed endless anyway think all <UNK> <UNK> dialogue dubbed when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish handy tip we brits clip words not sentences and somehow we manage to <UNK> at the same time but that's only if we've been to a really good public that's private to you school
<START> this was another world war ii message to the soldiers and to the allies to be careful about <UNK> rumors these were called <UNK> cartoons because it was a mixture of serious messages along with a funny looking main character called <UNK> <UNK> br br all of us have <UNK> along with fears and what have you and that's what happens here as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with five you can start <UNK> and all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them that includes losing confidence in your country and your cause as pointed out here in this cartoon a good way to lose a war is <UNK> the enemy that's still being done today br br we lost the war declares one big <UNK> near the end of this cartoon amazing how some americans still haven't learned this cartoon may be <UNK> years old but it sure has relevance today as i write this there were two terrorist <UNK> in europe today and some people still think the war on terror is just a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amazing br br the writer the famous dr <UNK> uses <UNK> of hot air balloon juice here to present the above message with theodore <UNK> his real name you know the <UNK> will be clever br br nothing hilarious here but it wasn't meant to be you have to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that was out there during world war ii people forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning it was a tense time
<START> i'd heard of eddie izzard but had never seen him in action i knew he was a <UNK> and when i saw he was on hbo one night last summer i put it on not knowing how my husband would react well he blew us away he's better than robin williams ever was he has total control of the audience when he does the <UNK> is dead no he's <UNK> routine the audience doesn't know what to think by the end god as james mason is also an inspired touch and his version of the python spanish <UNK> as carried out by the church of england <UNK> or death ' is priceless my jaws were <UNK> from laughter by the end of the show we <UNK> the tv <UNK> for months after that to be able to see him again and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on if you get the chance to see this show <UNK> everything and tape it you won't be disappointed
<START> why do all movies on lifetime have such <UNK> titles an unexpected love <UNK> how provocative this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very <UNK> fashion you might enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people why am i wasting my time writing about it
<START> i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched <UNK> of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind <UNK> message should look like definitely the broken is not one of those movies i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be <UNK> and lifeless so you start waiting on the movie characters to show their <UNK> sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed but though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no <UNK> scenes at all and the <UNK> of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong <UNK> evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments furthermore if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages they're supposed to <UNK> the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the <UNK> i guess horror movies should have blood screams intensity <UNK> body organs and parts because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the <UNK> nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of for instance the horror movie train with all the <UNK> and <UNK> of it and its similarity almost in everything with hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs <UNK> by <UNK> people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them br br and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary i prefer the addiction message presented in <UNK> for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex tv safety being <UNK> etc can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from <UNK> <UNK> ecstasy <UNK> lessons believe it or not entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems death
<START> this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses from the time they walk in to the time hardy just falls off the roof this keeps me laughing hysterically i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short i also recommend all of the ghost series if you are looking for laughs see this movie and you will be happy
<START> what is with all of the european especially england comments here all i gotta say is that when i saw this movie for the first time when i was like 13 i thought it was great of course it's stupid that's the point you have to see the movie dr <UNK> and men in black to get the whole joke behind this movie but come on people what did you expect to see i can think of many movies that are far worse than this and they were expensive <UNK> films with real actors in them for what it's worth men in white is a very stupid funny mock of a movie and with all the stupid funny stuff that england has been making for the last half century i am shocked at all the negative comments us stupid americans like our stupid humor p s see <UNK> america world police for some true laughs that europeans will especially like ha
<START> i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show angel you'll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasn't there the pacing was practically <UNK> plot points were buried under a sea of <UNK> dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or anything br br is it the redneck is it the wendigo no it's a cameraman on speed that's not scary it doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie <UNK> <UNK> laughter from the audience br br terrible film
<START> the plot kurt harris jeff <UNK> a bitter ex cop goes undercover in the <UNK> after his friend is killed by their leader while there he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor and will do anything to achieve this goal even murder the cast is good jeff <UNK> is a good martial artist and good actor <UNK> <UNK> plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays <UNK> <UNK> also him good martial artist the direction is good the fight scenes also the rest is ok with tony burton who plays a friend of kurt killed from <UNK> and <UNK> pass plays a bad girl from producers of another action martial arts film bounty <UNK> with <UNK> lamas a good action film the best film of martial law series
<START> drum scene is wild cook jr is <UNK> hero of this and many movies fantastic actor great flick a few twists that keep you moving a must see
<START> rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent there is almost nothing <UNK> to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film what few interesting <UNK> the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings actors of stature robert duvall robert downey jr are <UNK> in roles which go nowhere a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee <UNK> camera lens a writer john <UNK> who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of under motivated <UNK> the film has a cheap <UNK> feel about it but barely at the level of commentary its really part of the aesthetic normally i come on to the imdb to write balanced generally <UNK> comments this <UNK> disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless <UNK> rant i won't but only because i no longer want to <UNK> my mind with this trash
<START> outrage is pretty good movie robert <UNK> was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things it isn't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one
<START> good film tells a <UNK> fantasy story telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme <UNK> one has to take to behave differently or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know how would you do it without creating a <UNK> social situation also it's about the <UNK> of deciding over others cultural life of what kind of culture that is <UNK> down our throats what gives disney or fox or the suicide <UNK> the right to decide what is our choice are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self do we have to listen to the <UNK> shouting see the stupid <UNK> <UNK> and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee
<START> i had some <UNK> about this movie i figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about christmas being in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snow br br this movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james <UNK> he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dad br br if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
<START> this budget <UNK> italian action sci fi hybrid features david <UNK> as a miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of atlantis to stop an evil businessman academy award <UNK> john ireland from using a <UNK> <UNK> grown using <UNK> from an <UNK> to rule the world you got all that despite such a <UNK> plot this is actually quite a bore and the <UNK> of atlantis <UNK> at it with contempt honestly the most intentionally creative thing about this flick is the slight <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> beverly hills cop theme for the opening titles the most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back to back perhaps director <UNK> de martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career i was going to <UNK> this <UNK> worst film on his resume but then i saw <UNK> <UNK> was listed on there i would also like to safely <UNK> that i am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and hitchcock's vertigo
<START> what network was <UNK> murder on i thought it was cbs am i right or also back in those days the actual production h q was near about the van <UNK> airport i surely remember because i practically made nearly two episodes in those <UNK> more i remember the early days i had found an article in <UNK> <UNK> giving this actor writer a clue to a terrific episode so just for suggesting it i was awarded awarded or not i sadly didn't develop it and was cut out of it all due to poor publicity of mine so as a justification i learned as i always have the hard way roll the <UNK> <UNK> just a side bar on mr van dyke he had a house in the <UNK> area on <UNK> road and it was an incredible party house dick had a terrific sense of <UNK> when he built that house
<START> unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend pretty young girls in peril i have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road trip shots you actually think for a second there's going to be quality in the production watching unhinged was like seeing an amateur acting class go through it's warm up some of the most awkward badly lit overlong scenes are played out with the gusto of a <UNK> <UNK> i wondered why they didn't just put the cue cards on camera so the actresses wouldn't have to constantly shift their <UNK> the two main girls were obviously chosen for their t a factor rather than talent laurel <UNK> as the main chick terry is as exciting as watching paint dry two nude scenes make for an adolescent thrill janet <UNK> and virginia settle as the crazy creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stranded with compete for worst acting ever long pauses weird expressions emphasis on the wrong word it's all there and is a delight for those of us out there who love bad films the scenes shift suddenly with long black outs you could drive a mack truck through cartoon lightning crashes across shots without even bothering to show the sky eighties <UNK> <UNK> the viewer but ya know it grew on me i felt sorry for it i wanted to hug it kiss it's boo <UNK> and make it better the ending doesn't make up for the damage it's caused but i <UNK> anyway i have my own theories regarding the whole banned hype and hope that anyone who chooses to view this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor otherwise pass
<START> watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year it wasn't at all a bad movie certainly not average but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one dimensional which perhaps as based on frank <UNK> comic book was the right decision to go with but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that <UNK> of a 14 year old feeling watching <UNK> men fighting in bloody sword led combat with the occasional freaky creature or super hot female to go with the <UNK> surroundings while i would probably re watch fire and ice before 300 again they both <UNK> that similar feeling the exception this time being naturally that it's frank <UNK> the infamous artist and designer of countless <UNK> books and comics <UNK> with director ralph bakshi in what isn't typical hollywood fare but something for the die hard fans br br what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time it may now be <UNK> nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day is the possible cons mentioned before and maybe that you will see something somewhat unique fire and ice isn't even the only bakshi <UNK> feature but it's possibly the most fluid if not quite my personal favorite of the few he made and he and his team create a whole striking world that's part pre historic part out of this world fantastic and part medieval and all touched up with a <UNK> hand with respect to the backgrounds the <UNK> and grounds there's a slight <UNK> for bakshi fans in this <UNK> of character design bakshi went as far as to say it's more <UNK> than him this may be true but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or <UNK> in quick or slow motion my favorite was the <UNK> <UNK> guide how they <UNK> that <UNK> me br br i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really <UNK> it if you're already a die hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two <UNK> <UNK> or a <UNK> or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or <UNK> <UNK> so suffice to say it's about well fire against ice with characters named <UNK> and <UNK> the coolest male of the lot and most comic book in appearance and <UNK> the typical <UNK> who's almost too perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure what the plot does do as an asset is allow a series of <UNK> and suspense bits around the action the progression of the danger in the <UNK> big battle like when the <UNK> are hunting after <UNK> and have to <UNK> with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree <UNK> and <UNK> and per usual for bakshi he <UNK> up some <UNK> if not quite his usual inspired <UNK> in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material if you've seen <UNK> you'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent br br so if you're an animation buff seek this out right away for some <UNK> <UNK> i e 1980s action and incredible design for everyone else it's good not great as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century <UNK> with some <UNK> 300
<START> i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver br br morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself br br i thought jennifer <UNK> character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards <UNK> basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that's the way it was written br br i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened br br i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart br br a funny film
<START> something that really does not go down right with al gore and his supporters 's theory is the whole thing about <UNK> br br if there were such a <UNK> why is it that the <UNK> in the almighty global warming feel the <UNK> need to try and bully anyone who questions them br br why is it that anyone who does not toe the line on global warming is met with smug <UNK> of being either stupid or on the <UNK> of the oil companies apparently being a professional global warming <UNK> does not mean you're on anyone's <UNK> in that wondrous world why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole question is settled when it is the very nature of science to honestly question <UNK> for some ideas on the answer to those questions read prey by the well know oil <UNK> michael <UNK> oh wait he is rich and not on the <UNK> of the oil companies he just took a huge career risk in not <UNK> the line of the <UNK> and other <UNK> <UNK> and told the truth as he <UNK> it by the way did you know that <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> would result in almost no <UNK> of <UNK> according to its own <UNK> just a few questions that al gore made sure to stay away from <UNK> he not get every penny of the <UNK> <UNK> in case he decides to run again br br so who's a <UNK>
<START> the title creatures <UNK> havoc at a peaceful little desert town that's basically the whole plot for this film and while the scenes devoted to the <UNK> themselves are somewhat fun in a <UNK> kind of way all the rest is just filler and bad filler at that from the hero who is a painful woody allen wannabe to the ultra dumb town cop it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film there were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and i was thinking ok at least the girlfriend is cute but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons the film is also filled with pop references from <UNK> <UNK> to linda blair which probably made it already dated by the early 90's 1 2
<START> this is the movie i've seen more times than any other i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released and every time i see it it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex <UNK> cinematography this movie is an absolute must for any self <UNK> movie lover in the same league <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection
<START> this episode of twilight zone combines a silent section <UNK> with melodramatic acting and sight gags an homage to the early buster keaton films lots of slapstick buster falling on a <UNK> door falling in a <UNK> running around pants less silly <UNK> invention of a time helmet reminiscent of a flash gordon idea of what the future would be cheap <UNK> like 1 95 for ladies hats or 17 cents a pound for <UNK> seem outrageously high to buster even the world of <UNK> is too much for buster <UNK> how shocking when he is <UNK> transported to the modern world of 1960 buster was trying to go backwards the scientist of that time wants to return to a <UNK> world the <UNK> that he has studied and admired they go back together and buster <UNK> is now happy and the scientist regrets not having electronic equipment modern <UNK> or an electric <UNK> so buster sends him back with the crazy helmet br br this twilight zone doesn't have a heavy message since buster keaton died in 1966 it is one of his last efforts that's enough br br one other cute thing longtime <UNK> <UNK> man jesse white is a <UNK> who <UNK> the time helmet <UNK> his <UNK> machine career
<START> this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a <UNK> fighting scenes are very good there's a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but it's only my opinion to watch and it's fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too <UNK> at least for me hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's so five <UNK> or other its versions is great choice
<START> god i love this movie if you grew up in the 80's and love heavy metal this is the movie for you they really don't get much better than this the <UNK> soundtrack is one of the best <UNK> ever i put on the record when it first came out and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie kid's favorite singer dies kid plays record backwards hero comes back in demonic form and rocks the town what more could you ask for br br if you haven't seen it yet rush out and buy it you will not be disappointed metal rules
<START> i've seen this movie more than once it was on par with a lot of the spooky stuff that was being shown in television movies back then the only problem i had was with the title for the obvious reasons one immediately thinks of the famous <UNK> cake by <UNK> leaving off the first part <UNK> of <UNK> would have <UNK> br br richard crenna always manages to bring a sense of seriousness to anything he does anyway whether the plot is good or bad but this was an enjoyable halloween fare offered by the cbs network i loved the part where crenna takes a flight to some obscure country to find the <UNK> who would help him <UNK> the evil beast he asks the cab driver how to find this guy great dialogue between the native cab driver and crenna in terms of the <UNK> <UNK> his own people's ethnic beliefs <UNK> mr barry i left that stuff behind when i came down from the mountains ' referring to the <UNK> who rarely sees or <UNK> people and nobody knows how to really contact him br br as far as supernatural fare goes this movie is still enjoyable
<START> okay if you've seen the ring you've basically seen the grudge it's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that <UNK> didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and it's not really clear what bill <UNK> character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was <UNK> alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
<START> every time i see nicole i like her more i love a movie like this a woman you just won't give up on but she keeps breaking your heart first movie i remember seeing like this was of human bondage the kim novak laurence harvey version the <UNK> about the correctness of the russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can't speak russian i'm sure funny how people miss the point the no <UNK> russian guys were well cast too finally i have to tip my hat to ben chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a <UNK> with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and nicole to think guys get paid for that mind blowing

<START> i got to see this on the plane to <UNK> last week and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book i have to say i was <UNK> impressed if anything the <UNK> <UNK> to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to <UNK> <UNK> who have had success through the years as a brit i was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what's going on one question springs to mind was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the <UNK> or was another team in the frame as a red sox fan myself weird i know a brit who understands baseball i have to say that it added to the enjoyment
<START> i'd completely forgotten about this film until now this was the most blatant and worst attempt to <UNK> a <UNK> that i have ever seen it's message seemed to be don't teenagers use their imagination they might take games seriously go mad and hurt people i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that d d style games are form of evil ritual or <UNK> worship
<START> unfortunately the director <UNK> <UNK> died from aids related <UNK> the year after making this film so we don't know how many more gay related films we might have had from him i found this used dvd from <UNK> on amazon but it looks like none of his other works are still available <UNK> <UNK> amazing grace contains full frontal male nudity at least in magazines which turn into a <UNK> dream sequence and some drug use this is the story of two families getting by or trying to but the mothers the daughters and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out jonathan played by gal <UNK> meets up with the next door neighbor thomas who has his own problems of course either the <UNK> are a little weak or maybe <UNK> kept the conversation sparse on purpose for a little mystery watching this i get the feeling we're not getting the whole story but that's ok throw in a cute gay roommate ex lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who went on to do many projects mostly <UNK> tv lots of smoking lots of worrying by the mothers a great blues song all night long blues done by an unknown female artist if she is listed in the credits sadly it was not translated to english nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect like any other relationship but then usa always has been years behind other countries in this way a good way to spend 98 minutes i wanted to see even more of it won awards at several film festivals <UNK> to imdb and the film jacket
<START> i have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical <UNK> even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their <UNK> are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90's setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are <UNK> spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation
<START> this movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings <UNK> had tried to make other <UNK> efforts like his work in <UNK> fu for the <UNK> and his <UNK> of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film making that is steel br br there's not a single good thing to be said about this movie i saw it a bunch of times when i was very young but i must've been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart it's fun to mock i saw it on the disney channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its <UNK> br br if you see it on tv try this consider as your watching the film <UNK> from it all the scenes in which <UNK> uses his magical genie powers if you do that it becomes like a film about a <UNK> chasing a kid and <UNK> to seduce him that's kinda funny and disturbing br br a horrible example of film do not unless looking to mock it see this movie

<START> after reading the reviews it became obvious that everyone <UNK> this work how utterly boring oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other br br i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the saturday afternoon <UNK> this was an <UNK> movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> monsters like myself or was self and it was a movie theatre filler at the time almost as big as the wizard of oz br br imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot problem is was that it was rather a <UNK> here goes randolph scott cowboy hero <UNK> friends and goes <UNK> those evil people <UNK> br br all of us kids figured out that plot before we <UNK> our quarter down to watch it that was just about the plot line of every scott john wayne roy rogers film ever made if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie just don't ask for surprises br br one must remember the context of the times there was no or little tv none for kids there was school there was the great <UNK> there were toy guns no <UNK> time and the steam age had just <UNK> but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the <UNK> of young <UNK> even the girls got into it br br this movie was the entertainment and it is just as mindless as anything produced today it had a purpose originally of being propaganda but quickly came to be kids movies br br our fathers had experienced the real thing and it wouldn't be until sam <UNK> a decade later who finally <UNK> the red <UNK> of imitation blood in realistic and <UNK> <UNK> not until his <UNK> did anyone die slowly with great pain and miserably until <UNK> war and gun fights were a rather <UNK> affair thanks sam br br to see a movie had little or no blood the adults didn't mind they wouldn't have <UNK> it i think no guts <UNK> the shattering plant life so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory <UNK> ho was suitable for kids then br br you will see that i assigned a four to this rating why would i do that well it is a terrible movie no matter how i love it i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms basically <UNK> ho <UNK> to become a romance novel for children br br should people watch it of course i am not saying to stay away realistically however the plot is simple the characters shallow they are <UNK> you can love a bad movie
<START> guy <UNK> noble effort is beat up knocked down raped kicked around shot stabbed spit upon <UNK> <UNK> and abused and left for dead by <UNK> dreadful performance her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the al gore school of <UNK> and public speaking guy ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this and if you <UNK> all of the scenes that his wife was in it's a fair movie at best i think that the best acting job ever had to be guy <UNK> his wife that her performance was good enough not to re shoot if you have an opportunity of watching swept away or <UNK> your <UNK> for <UNK> minutes go for the extended <UNK>
<START> this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself i first saw the trailer in 1991 it looked great since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it until today yes 14 years later br br lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal ok i knew it wouldn't be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no brain film in the <UNK> mold unfortunately it was not it's <UNK> br br whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening br br the fight scenes were rubbish and look fake br br this dvd only cost me <UNK> and i believe i was <UNK> by <UNK> br br now i'm sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back
<START> bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the <UNK> bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly <UNK> field <UNK> in black and white with color <UNK> when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this made for tv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is it's emotionally rather flat it's difficult to form an <UNK> to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the self serving government <UNK> are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but it's definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavy handed government <UNK> that was a characteristic of the fifties 7 10

<START> i thought this movie was excellent for the fact that <UNK> and sean are <UNK> to the business it was packed with action and a little romance but there were some points when <UNK> didn't speak very clearly when she threatened sean with the gun and she <UNK> her teeth maybe she was supposed to i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very well and there was an obvious contrast also because i watched next action star i am certain that <UNK> and sean did their own stunts which were performed very well i am looking forward to another movie by the pair as they make a great team or perhaps a sequel to bet your life possibly called <UNK> it big in the big <UNK> it could this time be about carmen bet your life is excellent
<START> can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful <UNK> <UNK> the plot is well hidden in several sub levels of <UNK> i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead
<START> this film is the worst film but it ranks very high for me it is how a slasher movie should be it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students the teachers are dumber than a sack of <UNK> it is filled with good catholic priest sexually repressed humor bad hair bad clothes the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes the <UNK> have some creativity and seem to <UNK> around stabbing people in the <UNK> a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad i recommend this film for a fun time get a case of cheap beer and some friends watch it and laugh
<START> i absolutely love this game to death ever since i was 9 years old i am now 15 it has great graphics characters magic weapons <UNK> and don't forget the ultimately awesome <UNK> forms i am still waiting for a remake prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game br br you play as <UNK> a young <UNK> who has the potential to be quite the hero on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element such as fire darkness water ice thunder lightning earth light and wind there are also items known as <UNK> spirits which allow you to <UNK> into magical creatures of legend dragons <UNK> creatures called <UNK> and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action packed thrills and excitement one of my all time favorite games the legend of <UNK>
<START> i could not believe the low 5 6 rating on imdb about johnny dangerously at the moment i wrote this review and i thought i had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as i can seriously to get a rating so low the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor not to mention a very shallow opened mind if you don't like humorous flicks don't watch them combining absurd humour a very good storytelling and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags this movie has made its way into my dvd collection and that is without mentioning the visual <UNK> <UNK> here and there and of course the use of <UNK> <UNK> and clichés based on our favorite organized crime movies br br i showed this movie to a lot of people and being introduced to it without any specific expectations except maybe watching a comedy the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion they all liked it very much it goes well it's not long to watch and there are absolutely no <UNK> downs in the evolution of the story which i think is really straightforward sure it's not perfect some gags fall a bit short but no movie is perfect especially when considering other opinions that yours that is why i rated this movie 9 out of 10 this movie is in my opinion a <UNK> like top secret and <UNK> in the field of absurd but well thought comedies which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and <UNK> side sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly if at all as a final word i would like to say watch it for yourself do not follow average <UNK> saying and if you don't like it then you'll know for real it was not good for your tastes which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is billed as something special a crime drama that consists of a series of episodes each set on one particular day of a police <UNK> but in fact this element of the story turns out to be rather less significant than might at first be thought as the fact that the action in each episode is confined to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little <UNK> the program from countless other crime stories in fact one almost can't help drawing comparisons to the last <UNK> <UNK> as one of the sub plots focuses on a single cynical female cop approaching retirement and it's not just the absence of helen <UNK> that makes the comparisons <UNK> there's a lot of earnest over <UNK> manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly contrived so that each one is in some sense sympathetic in another suspicious and it's possible to guess the guilty party well before the end not because of the internal dynamic of the story but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole certain things must be true to justify the way that the series focuses on certain characters at certain times in spite of these <UNK> the series grew on me by the end i was quite <UNK> but it's a sad sign that the bbc which once made the likes of 'the singing <UNK> <UNK> of this of possibly the best drama of the year for there's little true originality on offer here and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadfully disappointing <UNK> <UNK> is in fact not rubbish but it is formulaic and one would hope that the very best the bbc had to offer would be something a little more innovative and fresh
<START> charles boyer is supposed to be spanish and he's come to london to buy coal in <UNK> agent a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall <UNK> <UNK> peter lorre dan seymour and <UNK> <UNK> boyer is luis <UNK> and everyone is out to stop him except bacall his papers are stolen he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the <UNK> br br this film has its good and not so good points it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense and it is highly entertaining bacall is incredibly beautiful boyer is passionate <UNK> is mean lorre is slimy <UNK> appropriately pathetic and seymour outrageously wonderful br br the not so good points bacall is supposed to be english and boyer spanish uh no boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent but bacall is 100 american not of the british upper class the two have no chemistry conclusion bacall is somewhat miscast her acting isn't up to snuff either she's better in other films but she's an astonishing looking woman and much can be forgiven br br <UNK> is nearly over the top and hateful dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature it's a great part and his performance is perfect while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good this was definitely a case of no small parts only small actors seymour wasn't a small actor br br definitely worth seeing even with its flaws
<START> with a bo derek movie the audience get just what they expect a paper thin plot and a few shots of mrs derek in no clothes <UNK> can't do <UNK> is just that the first fifteen minutes is ordinary tv drama as long as scott anthony quinn is still alive he is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes bo derek is the opposite always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes the movie is a complete waste of time if you want to see quinn rent lawrence of <UNK> or la <UNK> if you want to see nude women or bad acting rent any porno movie
<START> unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you an attempt was made to <UNK> a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it doesn't work br br when <UNK> <UNK> does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her br br the documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much <UNK> view of that period of our history br br no one with the exception of <UNK> myers could be accused of acting however he does an incredible job
<START> exquisite comedy starring <UNK> davies with the <UNK> william haines young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom cameo performances showcase all the stars in <UNK> heaven in the famous <UNK> scene plus lots of vintage film making detail for the <UNK> <UNK> also captures for <UNK> <UNK> famous <UNK> sarcastic <UNK> of the top stars of the day her <UNK> is a <UNK> br br peggy even catches herself as she encounters the famous star <UNK> davies at <UNK> turns up her nose and comments <UNK> i don't like her br br my print was perfect story direction acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent <UNK>
<START> as a long time fan of superman from the comics through the 1950s series the first two of the chris reeves films and lois clark and finally <UNK> i was really hoping for something clever with superman returns br br instead we got lex luthor making another attempt at real estate <UNK> another superman beaten up while wearing <UNK> sequence and internal inconsistencies he couldn't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 of <UNK> but when lois breaks off 3 of it leaving the rest <UNK> in him he can lift a continent into space really the only hero in the story was <UNK> partner i can't remember his name off hand he did all kinds of life saving heroic things with nothing but guts and skill no <UNK> no <UNK> just a normal human br br they keep making superman so small why can't we have superman battling <UNK> or fighting to save the universe from general <UNK> instead of <UNK> petty schemes oh i forgot they're doing that in <UNK> br br yeah i think i'll stick to <UNK> br br you probably should too
<START> <UNK> is not for all in fact <UNK> maybe in for nobody except lynch and that's what make it funny and a collective cartoon violent yes profanity yes absurd yes a piece of garbage never <UNK> is a wonderful picture of some americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun from <UNK> i can say i love it my favorite episodes are 1 my <UNK> are bleeding all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed 2 get the stick yeah baby get it and learn a lesson some people never be thankful for your actions 3 ants the more lynch episode of all music <UNK> and a very sweet revenge
<START> a worn out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case the equally worn out plot of an <UNK> on the inside who eventually is shut out br br with such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene <UNK> by with no change in intensity no character <UNK> and inexplicable behavior br br the homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely <UNK> it seemed to be included only to <UNK> the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture br br a <UNK> dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and <UNK> scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss
<START> for years madonna has tried to prove not only herself but the public eye that she can act unfortunately trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well br br she seems to fare better when she's not the star of any movie if you watch her in supporting performances in desperately seeking susan 1985 or a league of their own 1992 she actually comes off looking good since the story revolves on other actors the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by <UNK> br br the trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie regardless the genre being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way whether it be good mediocre or plain awful she has to <UNK> in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance this is the crucial difference between madonna and let's say bette davis or meryl streep the latter two even if the movie were to fail because the visual storytelling lacked some <UNK> in having us relate to it or because the script fell short or because the actress per se was just not at her moment there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb both davis and streep have had their share bette having a longer career than streep in such fare as bunny <UNK> 1971 and wicked stepmother 1989 streep in she devil 1989 but at least there's been that <UNK> in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the <UNK> of the movie and watch the performance br br madonna on the other hand not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself <UNK> much worse and even in the hands of someone as woody allen in shadows and fog 1992 an inferior classic she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff maybe even nervous as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go br br so here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two character movie guy ritchie more known for action movies filled in <UNK> energy seems as <UNK> telling a story closer to someone of the likes of <UNK> antonioni or <UNK> bergman who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease and at <UNK> minutes the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn it doesn't feel sincere from being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love this has to be the most unconvincing <UNK> degree turn since fay <UNK> laura suddenly discovered her passion for tommy lee jones in the eyes of laura mars 1978 equally unconvincing is <UNK> <UNK> nasty turn around the middle of the movie it lacks any humor and feels genuinely <UNK> and when he gives in to <UNK> love it's too quick to be believed filming this in slow music and a visual montage of <UNK> and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this transformation from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other br br trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well it only makes it drag <UNK> it down and when madonna has to be filmed going from hope to <UNK> in a tight close up it feels she's trying too hard many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late <UNK> early 30s where <UNK> <UNK> as acting a part or an emotion br br could the movie have been better of course there are a <UNK> of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again it's been done before in overboard 1987 for example it could have had an existential <UNK> in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change to ensure a moral tone much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been <UNK> for a more silent film look as in persona 1966 it could have even been something of a thriller providing that the <UNK> character have a mean streak as billy zane had in dead calm 1989 even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for madonna as the over the top uber control freak getting her <UNK> but with its mean <UNK> humor without at least a glimpse of her character having a <UNK> side that hides behind a mask of <UNK> and without really defining <UNK> own character this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the <UNK>
<START> this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life and i've seen some pretty bad movies i didn't like the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but it's absolutely horrible i've never seen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no plot it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming the story is too weird i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no point in even filming this movie if you're considering watching this movie don't you're just wasting your time
<START> i'd never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the <UNK> i thought i'd give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight not how i'd imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional <UNK> yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees <UNK> from <UNK> to <UNK> br br oh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey <UNK> was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good br br probably not the best movie to introduce tarzan 4 10

<START> first of all br br what the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch br br what the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked off a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth br br but from what i hear its not even offensive so they promise comedy through demented <UNK> of sick garbage and they cant even pull that off
<START> i went to see this a few days ago and it's hard to forget that film for the wrong reasons this film is supposed to be funny it's not not a single laugh in the theatre perhaps for <UNK> garcia and <UNK> depardieu and it's boring boring boring it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand i was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny what what did he say and i'm french i hate to say that given the fact that i think good films are made here but i <UNK> in advance for all <UNK> who will go see the film if ever shown outside of france br br we're deeply sorry for that <UNK> p 2 10
<START> i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the <UNK> <UNK> movie i've ever seen br br i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions br br 1 while being <UNK> stoned out of their minds 2 they've received hard cash for the votes 3 under <UNK> br br i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie
<START> ok i'm biased i live near <UNK> in england where this wonderful movie was filmed it still looks the same now i remember them filming here quite vividly and the fake snow on the streets for days on end often when i'm walking through <UNK> i see a street or a house and it will remind me of this film br br george c scott's scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions his physical appearance isn't the typical <UNK> scott's is big and <UNK> a man who finds those smaller than himself to be inferior br br we all know the story and the quotes the book is one of the most <UNK> works in the english language and i don't believe there are many <UNK> who would say that people aren't capable of change and redemption this film version portrays all of that quite beautifully george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english <UNK> with wonderful skill br br i love this movie if you haven't seen this version i would strongly urge that you do it's usually available for a very small amount of money or are you too mean
<START> if you were to judge based on the movie alone the <UNK> that gave the stage musical a chorus line a <UNK> prize and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years were all on heavy <UNK> because one <UNK> sensation this film certainly is not br br what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly <UNK> me but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a <UNK> of clay br br not content with the original score the way it was originally written someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some <UNK> thus we are <UNK> with the oscar nominated surprise surprise well surprise surprise the song stinks and so does the movie br br grade d
<START> this episode is a bit confusing some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but i have to say i was a bit confused from the beginning br br clark gets a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of <UNK> mental institution and is made fun of for believing that he's a superhero clark is told that the life that he knew was all in his head <UNK> he also find some things that are unusual <UNK> married to lionel lex is bound to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge and <UNK> is devoted to clark but he finds one <UNK> someone else who's devoted to clark chloe he also finds that a mental patient is also from the known world of <UNK> and the doctor is an <UNK> from the phantom zone br br this episode reminds me right back to a buffy episode called normal again where buffy begins to have vivid <UNK> about a mental asylum the doctor tried to convince her that all that she knew was a <UNK> of her imagination and that she was in fact crazy her parents were still married they still lived in la her friends didn't exist angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called dawn demons and vampires also didn't exist both episodes are a bit sad because doctors aren't just telling the characters that it's all a <UNK> of her imagination but it tells us what it really is fiction and it brings us back to reality it's nice though to have a sense of reality every once in a while but we watch these shows to escape from reality it's again nice because the characters have to overcome new challenges
<START> this is definitely not one of lucio <UNK> better flicks by any stretch of the imagination the plot is pretty bad a millionaire is murdered and his <UNK> calls upon his daughter to find out who did it but the biggest problem i have with this besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie was wondering why anyone should even care the father comes off as being a really big jerk to everyone he came across including the daughter who he asks to help him which made it quite hard for anyone to care who killed him but no one really watches a fulci flick for a good storyline to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting typically his movies try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of gore but even that is lacking in this movie if you're looking for a good fulci flick check out the beyond
<START> while i am not a big fan of musicals i have loved the films of fred astaire and ginger rogers because they are just so much fun sure they can be a bit formulaic but even though you know what is going to happen they still are very pleasing to watch however despite this i was a bit disappointed in this outing part of it was because this film doesn't have the wonderful supporting cast like you saw in top hat or shall we dance without edward everett <UNK> or eric <UNK> the film seems to be a bit lacking especially in the fun department the silly antics of these supporting actors gave the other films charm that you just don't get with follow the fleet in addition unlike the usual character played by astaire this one is more of a jerk as his fat head gets rogers into trouble again and again and as a result it's a lot harder to like him or want to see them get together in the end of the film plus although the music is by irving berlin the songs just don't seem as memorable in fact none of the songs were all that special and i can't recall any of them even though i just saw the movie while this is still a cute and worthwhile film it just lacks the <UNK> and magic of some of their other films good but far from great
<START> i just saw <UNK> i can remember the <UNK> for the movie from 1968 so i was interested in finally seeing it it may be the perspective of an american who never went to a british public school and misses some of the social references but i thought the movie was awful for one thing as others have pointed out it takes almost the entire movie for the much <UNK> at the time revolt to break out for another whether the last scene is real or imagined what occurs isn't a revolt but a shooting rampage there's quite a difference br br i know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events but one cannot avoid doing it here one person wrote a message board <UNK> asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at <UNK> high school and virginia tech but if there's a <UNK> of difference between <UNK> harris and <UNK> on the one hand and travis <UNK> mcdowell on the other i simply can't see it all four of them were under the <UNK> that their <UNK> is going to <UNK> a f ed up world that they <UNK> take no responsibility for br br which brings me to why the hell are travis and his <UNK> even in a school they so despise they are adults or close to it they're not in a military prison like the inmates in the hill a much better british film from about the same time no one is forcing them to go to college and take <UNK> from the the <UNK> except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake up about the nature of their sons i had the opportunity in college to join a frat except i couldn't stand to be given silly cruel orders by <UNK> claiming to be my <UNK> brothers i took the consequences of not having the in with the establishment that <UNK> provide and i can't say i <UNK> it br br if travis <UNK> himself the second coming of <UNK> whose <UNK> picture hangs <UNK> in his room he's free to go out and <UNK> a <UNK> union or work for michael foot in the next election if he wants to be jack <UNK> then get on the road and start writing what possible benefit is he giving the world in <UNK> a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room br br sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who <UNK> to the scene in last tango in paris where brando <UNK> about having had to go on a date with cow <UNK> on his shoes in the real world the person said a <UNK> would say why didn't you <UNK> it off change your shoes don't allow fictional characters to lay a self pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common sense alternative course of action for them so it is here
<START> as a fan of eric <UNK> studies of the contemporary war between the <UNK> i was very eager to see the lady and the duke <UNK> et le <UNK> for how he would treat men and women during a real war the french revolution br br the film looks beautiful with each scene designed as a period painting like a <UNK> <UNK> and i expected much talking as that's <UNK> style but maybe rohmer was restrained by <UNK> the screenplay on a real woman's <UNK> is why this mostly felt like a <UNK> version of the scarlet <UNK> br br as awful as the <UNK> of <UNK> et al how about some recognition that the french <UNK> were spoiled <UNK> i kept <UNK> to myself <UNK> we're poor and the poor stay poor you could also pick a tune from les <UNK> br br i wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country <UNK> to stay ahead of the revolution at one point her maid claims the <UNK> is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine <UNK> i simply didn't understand her an english <UNK> who alternately rejects and <UNK> her former lover and <UNK> as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus i think i was supposed to sympathize with her <UNK> more than their political <UNK> like a character out of the scarlet <UNK> hey the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the prince of <UNK> or somebody br br usually in a revolutionary period there's some <UNK> of change going on in relations between men and women but i saw none here i once went to a herbert <UNK> lecture that <UNK> with a lengthy q a the last question from an audience member far older than the rest of us <UNK> heck she had gray hair was why are <UNK> so grim she was <UNK> at and <UNK> didn't <UNK> to respond to it seriously but it's the only thing of substance i remember from the whole evening rohmer demonstrates that counter <UNK> are also grim and <UNK> br br originally written 8 11 2002
<START> i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief br br i would love to <UNK> this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed br br although this was released before alien and a <UNK> of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 s and the political climate of the 70 s when i think of it this was a real sci fi a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them
<START> of all the film <UNK> of the 1940s and 1950s this has to rank as one of the strangest and most fun to watch i say that because of the four main actors orson welles rita hayworth everett sloane and glenn <UNK> br br the first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me especially <UNK> his character george <UNK> is one of the strangest people i've ever seen on film his voice and some of the things he said have to be heard to be believed <UNK> isn't far behind in the strange category hayworth is not as glamorous with short blonde hair but still is hayworth which means a lot to <UNK> if you are a guy welles' is as fascinating as always one tip if you have the dvd turn on the english subtitles his character in this movie is an <UNK> and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says br br welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups you also have a unique ending visually with a shootout in a house of mirrors great stuff as bizarre as this film is i still thought the <UNK> like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene other than that no complaints br br this is great entertainment which is the name of the game
<START> a group of us watched this film are were really disgusted we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo wasn't on it's not like the writers producers could do anything about that the writing was poor the script was sub par what really annoyed us 1 when the two guys realized they were both dating natalie they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid and ultimately <UNK> contest but only because they were macho competing guys not because they really wanted natalie 2 despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him and there was no <UNK> that he was really a better guy it's as if the writers <UNK> a <UNK> and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film 3 blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children she <UNK> agrees with him
<START> every now and again you hear radio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> movies that the <UNK> can't stand or never watched all the way through this is the movie that i think of days later br br it's got something to do with a play by shakespeare not sure but i think i <UNK> on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it think i realised that my <UNK> wouldn't clip themselves and they were looking at me <UNK> to get cut br br this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me br br even though this is the first movie i've given such a low score to which i've actually attempted to watch i wouldn't want to put you off other movies by it's english director peter <UNK> i remember thinking that his the cook the thief his wife and her lover was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach <UNK> a brilliant movie but i can understand why people would <UNK> at seeing it br br another good film by <UNK> was a <UNK> and two <UNK> again it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste but was intriguing nonetheless br br the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is brazil never managed to watch that all the way through either kept falling asleep br br unless you have a taste for self important movies which are off <UNK> highly <UNK> <UNK> paced and difficult to follow then steer clear of <UNK> books
<START> i'm <UNK> sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a <UNK> heap br br who knows <UNK> may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like blair and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> likes of <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> some woman br br but on film it just falls apart faster than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern <UNK> and one of them a woman i'd guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are <UNK> in grotesque <UNK> ways br br okay right there you have a cross section of plots from the exorcist the omen ten little indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic <UNK> run amok line none of it is very entertaining and for the most part you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over br br no not even linda blair and david <UNK> help matters much they're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all br br from the looks of it <UNK> probably wishes he were back on the <UNK> with pam anderson and who can blame him and linda well who knows a celebrity <UNK> benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays br br and the torture scenes <UNK> you'll see people get their mouths <UNK> shut <UNK> up inside roaring <UNK> strung up in trees during a violent storm <UNK> <UNK> out of their <UNK> etc etc <UNK> and i thought mark of the devil was the most sadistic movie i'd seen br br don't bother it's not worth your time i can't believe i told you as much as i did if you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches and yes blair gets possessed as if you didn't see that coming down main street followed by a <UNK> band br br no stars <UNK> these witches will give you <UNK>
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this flick i am of the firm belief that matt stone and <UNK> parker are comic geniuses of our time they have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it <UNK> but in a realistic way if that makes any sense this is mainly what makes south park <UNK> funny once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and <UNK> cartoon ever you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed that is apparent in baseketball although it is directed by david <UNK> and is utterly <UNK> it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace that is major league sports i am also a fan of sports so i find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love the opening prologue is brilliant tears from laughter form <UNK> i see those football players begin <UNK> some may not like this movie because it's just not everyone's cup of tea but just like south park once you look past the absurdity it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius i gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars
<START> <UNK> is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who <UNK> through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange see saw between oblivion and continuous <UNK> by others which is fairly typical in italy one may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though <UNK> and <UNK> were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well rounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year
<START> there are numerous films relating to ww2 but mother night is quite distinctive among them in this film we are introduced to howard campbell nolte an american living in berlin and married to a german <UNK> <UNK> lee who decides to accept the role of a spy more specifically a cia agent major <UNK> goodman <UNK> campbell who becomes a nazi <UNK> in order to enter the highest <UNK> of the hitler regime however the deal is that the us government will never acknowledge <UNK> role in the war for national security reasons and so campbell becomes a hated figure across the us after the war he tries to <UNK> his identity but the past comes back and <UNK> him his only friend is <UNK> but even he cannot do much for the <UNK> of events that fall upon poor campbell br br the story is deeply touching as we watch the tragedy of campbell who although a great <UNK> is treated by disdain by everybody who <UNK> him not only that but he also gradually realizes that even the persons who are most close to him have many secrets of their own <UNK> provides us with a moving atmosphere with <UNK> despair building up and almost <UNK> the viewer br br nolte plays the role of his life in my opinion he is even better than in <UNK> although in both roles he plays tragic figures who are destined to self destruction <UNK> lee is also excellent and the same can be said for the whole cast in general br br i haven't read the book so i cannot <UNK> how the film <UNK> to it in any case this is something of no importance here my critique is upon the film per se and the film <UNK> deserves a 9 10
<START> i just wanna say that amongst all the so called classic <UNK> films <UNK> seen like wild style <UNK> <UNK> style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others whenever i ask other people about which is their <UNK> then it seems that beat street pops out the most but still its the lowest <UNK> of all 4 3 is just a punch under the belt if say 5 points is the belt i love the music performances the <UNK> makes me wanna spin <UNK> makes me wanna throw a piece c'mon its a classic
<START> anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast script and director can put together a comedy masterpiece by the same token it's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid hollywood bore a <UNK> this movie was pathetic had it not been for john <UNK> a comic genius i would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid br br neil simon wouldn't write another screenplay for this version he said that he couldn't improve on the first and i'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he wouldn't sue for <UNK> of humor br br jack lemmon and sandy dennis did such a wonderful job in the original what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one how could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny i don't know but one thing i do know it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular
<START> having read the novel before seeing this film i was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot i feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of <UNK> work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story in the <UNK> of the film to a short <UNK> the film lost many of the key features which make the book <UNK> and <UNK> thus resulting in a somewhat <UNK> plot with little <UNK> there is no build up to the romance between rochester and jane eyre so this appears rather abrupt and <UNK> since the two characters have such <UNK> interaction you cannot help but imagine their <UNK> is superficial this is such an injustice to <UNK> novel you are given no impression of jane's quirky cheek and <UNK> which <UNK> rochester to her and his arrogance which <UNK> jane to him br br despite to poor scripting i think that a few of the characters were portrayed very <UNK> namely mrs <UNK> and grace <UNK> however overall the production was poor given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful see jane eyre 1970 with zelah clarke and timothy dalton for an outstanding production
<START> i really do fail to see the actual <UNK> value of this movie it's not bad enough to be hilarious there's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity although there was plenty of opportunity there's no gore there's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky <UNK> music that last part was actually funny on many occasions you see these natives hitting <UNK> and <UNK> and that's indeed what you hear badly <UNK> on the soundtrack but they also added this funky bass line on the soundtrack so where was the bass player at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists why all of the sudden it's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex which according to their myth <UNK> the wrath of the river alligator god i actually missed the explanation for that one but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex so why the sudden <UNK> and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water it's all silly and pointless this movie also features the <UNK> <UNK> american model i've ever seen br br at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird crazy old man lives the only point to that scene is that they make the shocking discovery that the killer crocodile is actually an alligator crocodile or alligator what's the difference it's big it's made out of plastic and it eats people all the same to me the alligator is a rather silly creation it's very stiff <UNK> and doesn't even <UNK> its feet when it <UNK> the eyes don't even move when they're shot in close up i guess they didn't know <UNK> back then in italy during 1979 there's also a lot of pointless inter cut shots of the local <UNK> i suspect it's stock footage br br like i said the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn't want to wake the sweet thing but the last half hour of the movie did get better we finally get to see some action when the alligator <UNK> through a <UNK> of <UNK> people <UNK> its teeth and <UNK> on them the most entertaining and at the same time funny scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it <UNK> we're looking at a <UNK> version of the van falling in the river here funny but nicely shot in fact there are several other nice traveling camera moves surprisingly for this type of flick i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie but i don't wanna spoil it completely in case you do decide to watch this movie my advice is to stay away from it if you wanna see a decent alligator movie then see lewis <UNK> alligator i admit that one isn't italian and isn't a jaws rip off but it certainly is more fun and if you're interested in other movies made by director sergio martino then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining <UNK> after the fall of new york that one's an over the top rip off of every possible existing post apocalyptic future of doom movie italians and rip offs two words that go together very well
<START> i've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting considering medical facts that can be learned but this is totally <UNK> and <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> relationships of the show's characters everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone even during office hours which is ridiculously unrealistic there doesn't seem to be one solid lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show everyone is broken up and on the <UNK> hardly a true reflection of all americans indeed there is a total lack of respect for marriage or <UNK> and it's truly <UNK> br br then we are presented with endless little moral <UNK> and they're generally solved in such a way that <UNK> anyone who doesn't agree with the all knowing <UNK> management and staff of the private practice for instance in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and <UNK> absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on anyone who <UNK> with this is portrayed as immature and stupid br br and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro <UNK> <UNK> made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for <UNK> abortion on moral grounds the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion you're a freak hardly the popular sentiment in the us two of the main characters in the show <UNK> mention that they had <UNK> when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets in spite of the fact that research has shown women can <UNK> intense depression what's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to <UNK> in the script could have been written by planned <UNK> br br all in all this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far fetched medical situations throughout the whole show
<START> this so called documentary tries to tell that usa <UNK> the moon landing year right br br all those who have actually studied the case knows different br br first of all there is definitely proof when the <UNK> was on the moon they brought back many pounds of rock from the moon for <UNK> studies these where spread around the world to hundreds of <UNK> who tested them and they all <UNK> that they came from the same planet not earth because the inner <UNK> of the basic elements are different from those found on earth but similar to those <UNK> to be on the moon i e the conspiracy <UNK> never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest br br another <UNK> claim from them is that their was wind in the <UNK> where they shot the moon landing i e the flag moves there is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand so it moved and what proves this well if the conspiracy <UNK> even studied the footage they would see that the flag never moves after the astronaut have let it be i e the conspiracy <UNK> are bad scientists they cant study a subject properly or only studies it until they have what they came for so that they can make a lie from that and make a profit i e this so called documentary br br a claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources the artificial lighting from the studio once again the conspiracy <UNK> are wrong as usual the same would happen in an earth desert at night with no light sources but i doubt that any conspiracy <UNK> have ever been outside their <UNK> basement for more than how many days a star <UNK> convention is held over br br the conspiracy <UNK> are in denial big time they only see what they want to see so they make up all these lies to seem important that is a fact
<START> i guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point and that's exactly what embarrassed <UNK> resident jack <UNK> robin williams <UNK> to do in the best of times yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in good morning vietnam is playing football in this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a <UNK> title but ex <UNK> reno <UNK> kurt russell isn't just going to go along with it so easily br br granted it's not the best movie for either man but williams and russell are actually a pretty good comedy team and some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the <UNK> to say the least check it out
<START> <UNK> this one up in the win <UNK> this was a superb movie the acting performances were great and the script was equally great br br helen hunt was magnificent as the <UNK> police officer gina <UNK> gina was a complex character she was a rookie cop with the <UNK> police <UNK> she ended up in an affair with a <UNK> that she knew had a wife and kids all the while she took on the dangerous task of going undercover to catch a serial killer br br jeff <UNK> the ray liotta look alike did a bang up job as the confused often <UNK> police officer that had an affair with gina he was stoic as an officer but he was quite the opposite when it came to dealing with his feelings and his extra marital affair br br steven <UNK> most notably from the sitcom wings did a nice job as the quiet meek <UNK> <UNK> on the surface he was an innocent loser but beneath the surface <UNK> a cold hearted killer <UNK> really took on the persona of a <UNK> young adult with an <UNK> <UNK> to kill young boys br br the entire movie was spectacular each scene each verbal exchange let us know more and more about the characters the production team did a phenomenal job with <UNK> days if not weeks worth of events into a 90 minute movie this movie was a good example of doing a lot with little
<START> last christmas i was lucky enough to receive one of the <UNK> ultimate bourne <UNK> sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday given how many recent <UNK> have stumbled over the finishing line instead of <UNK> <UNK> through it i was somewhat <UNK> of approaching the bourne ultimatum but i really shouldn't have been worried the electric actions sequences and <UNK> fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series br br jason bourne matt damon returns after an apparent <UNK> about operation <UNK> a new program based on the old <UNK> project to the journalist simon ross <UNK> <UNK> at the guardian determined to <UNK> more about his half remembered past bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> believe that bourne himself is the <UNK> and start to pursue the rogue agent with <UNK> <UNK> can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old <UNK> silence him for good br br personally i felt slightly disappointed with the bourne supremacy as it <UNK> the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic bourne identity it seemed more like a slow burning spy novel rather than an action thriller no such <UNK> here every car crash punch kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully it still <UNK> a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films providing a suitable <UNK> to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed performances throughout are nearly <UNK> even julia styles begins to offer something more than book <UNK> eye candy the only real <UNK> is that this like the other bourne films has little to do with the original novel but unless you're a die hard <UNK> fan this isn't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest <UNK> br br nothing <UNK> me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears the bourne <UNK> is a cracking movie filled with enough bone <UNK> action to satisfy the meat heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute even at the final reel you're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not and if not what more do you want this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty odd years of movie history in order to start again bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until casino <UNK> gave the bond series the <UNK> it desperately needed missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition go and get yourself a copy of the dvd not the ultimate bourne collection though limited edition i'm afraid
<START> i really don't want to compare martin <UNK> cape fear to the classic <UNK> cape fear film but i can't help it not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film <UNK> taking the keys out of the <UNK> dog dying and even using bernard <UNK> score throughout the entire film he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can't help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene when comparing <UNK> version of cape fear to the classic version the remake comes out destroyed by the classic but even when taking the film by itself it's still bad br br now scorsese and screenwriter wesley <UNK> didn't just remake the <UNK> cape fear scene for scene they tried to do things differently unfortunately this is one of the film's problems gone is the original crazy and animal like max <UNK> who is out for personal revenge the max <UNK> in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to save sam <UNK> and who is in touch with his feminine side his words not mine also gone is the stand up and strong sam <UNK> seen in the classic cape fear film the sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy <UNK> <UNK> and very unlikable even mrs <UNK> is a completely different character she's <UNK> than max <UNK> is the overall story has also been changed around sam didn't <UNK> against <UNK> in court to put him in jail like in the classic version sam is now <UNK> ex lawyer who <UNK> suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him br br the overall story has been changed and i don't hold too much against it but the overall script is also weak all around other sub plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture they are also just poorly written the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with <UNK> and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have but they have some help in this department as well br br now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a <UNK> effective suggestive subtlety combined with a <UNK> brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety however scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear giving the film a cookie cutter early 1990s look no sense of danger no suspenseful scenes and little style unless you count <UNK> fire and the <UNK> style yeah there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe br br if all that wasn't enough the acting isn't great either robert de niro being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance starts off alright as max <UNK> but he gets <UNK> worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs <UNK> going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end as sam <UNK> nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film <UNK> juliette lewis who also <UNK> in an academy award nomination is decent enough in her role as <UNK> <UNK> but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her br br this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes and i can't figure out why i wanted to like it i really did i mean if there's going to be a remake of cape fear i'd rather like that one too but i just couldn't containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the <UNK> comparison to the original cape fear i found martin <UNK> cape fear to be a very bad film indeed the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles go figure
<START> this has to be one the best movies about serial killers that i've ever seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved silence of the <UNK> hbo has hit the <UNK> here this film is compelling from the first moment until the last br br this film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about it chronicles the decade long search for the russian serial killer <UNK> <UNK> stephen rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced <UNK> expert who is put in charge of the investigation and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the russian government willing to help him both of their performances are subtle masterpieces rea begins naive and unwilling to compromise while sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation towards the end rea becomes more world weary and beaten by the system while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic br br in any other movie i would have said that <UNK> performance stands out above the rest but here even it is <UNK> by jeffrey <UNK> as the serial killer himself <UNK> brilliantly creates a character here who <UNK> empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find he is a monster but he doesn't want to be and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are he is tortured ashamed but vicious as well br br if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter and it is very disturbing then you should see this movie
<START> i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear i completely disagree i'm going to give a simple review for the normal <UNK> out there i thought the casting was perfect i thought this was one of ed <UNK> best performances what an evil psychopath i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie i was <UNK> throughout this movie if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see i also noticed a young scarlett <UNK> in this movie this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it
<START> okay this wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting etc etc well that's my <UNK> anyway br br at any rate the movie kind of bored me i've watched a lot of really long movies but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on basically because i just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters i just kept thinking who cares i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained i understand that this was the <UNK> and all but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events br br the romance in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than i'm a guy and you're a girl which i don't consider much of a romance and yet i felt i was being <UNK> to the belief that these people were in love oh well i guess it's the whole all this horror around us we have each other to <UNK> to type thing or whatever i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl but that was just sort of dropped maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle i don't know br br oh well daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked and sue lee was all right i didn't exactly dislike jake but he seemed a bit too <UNK> i guess jack bull i did not care for at all and i'm pretty sure you're supposed to hate just about everyone else with the exception of the poor normal people who just get <UNK> down left and right it was pretty graphic and had that whole the horrors of war thing down but i've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme done better i enjoyed the <UNK> a lot for instance even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative but as i've already stated i'm a <UNK> what can i say
<START> the only real highlight in the movie is the death of the <UNK> guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it br br in every other way this film is a very lame rip off of jaws lake <UNK> and alligator with a little bit of godzilla 1998 thrown in br br as is standard for a 1990's style horror movie the two non starring females each take their clothes off at least once the female lead doesn't since she obviously has a better agent br br the whole movie <UNK> the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark <UNK> waters in this film a giant salt water crocodile also happens to be in the area people get eaten the movie ends br br i don't mind a bad horror movie but i really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is
<START> a may day 1938 when happen a huge <UNK> celebrating hitler's visit to rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between <UNK> sophia loren married to fascist john <UNK> and gabriel <UNK> mastroianni she's a boring housewife with several sons and he's a unhappy <UNK> homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the <UNK> she's left alone in her home when her <UNK> must to attend the historical celebration then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences the film is set on the historic meeting <UNK> hitler and <UNK> <UNK> along with others authorities as count <UNK> and king victor <UNK> iii describing the events by a radio voice in off which sometimes is irritating br br it's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility an <UNK> passionate romance between two <UNK> characters magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing of course <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sensible screenplay results in ever interesting elaborate and sentimental colorful and atmospheric cinematography by <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> musical score by <UNK> <UNK> with sensitive <UNK> the film won deservedly golden <UNK> 1978 to best foreign film br br director <UNK> imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi theatrical for example <UNK> <UNK> 1982 uses a french dance hall to illustrate the changes in society 2 <UNK> of <UNK> 1983 a <UNK> is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as thomas <UNK> luis <UNK> and marie <UNK> who <UNK> from revolutionary paris 3 <UNK> <UNK> 1987 all take place in the family's grand old roman flat and of course 4 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> special <UNK> where loren and mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof
<START> this is the best of shelley <UNK> high quality <UNK> tale theatre series the ugly <UNK> are broadway quality comedy relief and eve <UNK> is the <UNK> of wicked <UNK> jennifer <UNK> does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew <UNK> prince charming jean <UNK> plays the fairy <UNK> well although i'm not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve <UNK> comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the show's flow br br as is <UNK> with the series there are several <UNK> comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small <UNK> the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much
<START> we all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office right well this neil simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office sometimes it's just not worth going know what i mean and sometimes it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before in 1970 with jack lemmon and sandy dennis and much better also br br it's not that steve martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the <UNK> and <UNK> advertising <UNK> quite to the contrary on both counts and it's not that goldie hawn is equally inept either her work has been consistently good if not great ever since i first saw her in tv's <UNK> and <UNK> laugh in of the 1960s br br the problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all it's really about new york and why everybody should come to new york to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world that's if you're a new <UNK> br br look the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment this 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous <UNK> specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess for example not content with the star appeal of the main players there is a cameo relatively long also from <UNK> <UNK> then mayor of new york as we all know what  <UNK> <UNK> for president even then worse  a walking talking <UNK> for the <UNK> face of new york br br and then we have john <UNK> <UNK> his role as basil <UNK>  but this time as a <UNK> cross <UNK> also  once again <UNK> hotel staff <UNK> sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is in this role and in the process doing great damage to the memory of <UNK> towers arguably the best british comedy series bar none br br why was this 1999 movie made in the 1970s new york was a dying city in many ways it was almost literally <UNK> so when made in 1970 that was the city you saw grim dark moody unsettling and not the place that the <UNK> couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke as it was then <UNK> and all by 1999 things had gotten better <UNK> was back new york was <UNK> it was the big apple ready for you to bite into if you had the <UNK> br br so naturally the couple in this second coming find that <UNK> within themselves and finally join the fabulous <UNK> to continue the american dream of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hence this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps <UNK> as much as i like steve martin and goldie hawn in comedy this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great jack lemmon if you've seen the latter then definitely don't bother with this one
<START> evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are <UNK> one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members one's own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that <UNK> one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan <UNK> book and read it the <UNK> island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period <UNK> needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it
<START> the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the late 20th century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally <UNK> two of director richard <UNK> favorite enemies <UNK> and germans to make us believe that very arab looking men would be free to <UNK> around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both <UNK> are were run by locals and involve d much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are <UNK> in today's child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst <UNK> according to <UNK> international so why only point out <UNK> and then choose a german as the only european <UNK> it's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish director br br the acting is above average especially by peter ustinov <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> michael caine dr <UNK> is good as always
<START> this film is to the f b i 's history as <UNK> <UNK> farm is to the old west shamelessly <UNK> version of the federal <UNK> of investigation fight against crime <UNK> heavy hand did he have any other kind shows throughout with <UNK> quality script reading actors cheesy sets cheap sound effects and lighting 101 with jimmy stewart at 20 of dramatic capacity vera miles chewing the scenery the film features every c <UNK> known in the mid fifties with <UNK> a hint of irony or humor from the <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> yard <UNK> everything <UNK> of sound stages and back lots even the <UNK> are <UNK> and familiar i imagine <UNK> <UNK> got drunk every night except for a few very few interesting exterior establishing shots nothing here of note beyond a <UNK>
<START> i really felt cheated after seeing this picture it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing i don't understand what they were thinking when they made this it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos it ends suddenly and you know there's going to be another episode next week it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie there are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didn't know the rest of the story they wanted to make a dahmer 2 after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods all of a sudden i hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow <UNK> and killed at the age of <UNK> wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail how about showing how he got there how about showing <UNK> trial how about showing some more detail i can't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place i actually found myself saying in disbelief that's it that's the end i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made to the filmmakers i'd like to say if you're going to do it do it right
