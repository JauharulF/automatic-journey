<START> this was one of the highlights of st <UNK> semi forgettable second season before they <UNK> <UNK> or grew into their own in the third season and beyond this was not only a showcase for up and <UNK> like bill campbell and <UNK> <UNK> but was also the <UNK> of <UNK> search for his <UNK> this time through the concept of comedy still one of my favorite episodes br br on a side note i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character <UNK> was about to have a <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> character before being <UNK> interrupted by lt <UNK> i remember watching this episode <UNK> <UNK> at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean grey marvel girl br br it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is
<START> my <UNK> friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl there's no kissing sex scenes hollywood should learn more from korean productions sex is not always required in a good romantic movie br br the movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes <UNK> into the movie i like the part when <UNK> <UNK> almost <UNK> <UNK> wan the funniest moment is when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first love because he dumped <UNK> wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon how he became a father was revealed in the next scene which brings smiles to the audience br br <UNK> points 8 10
<START> it's a poor film but i must give it to the lead actress in this one <UNK> forbes she appeared to be acting the least and i personally thought she was kind of cute too bad she only appears in one other film in the <UNK> besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and <UNK> death scenes people get stabbed and they <UNK> like 2 <UNK> of blood but if you like to watch poor horror films i recommend this one highly
<START> flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe inducing dialogue at places no twists they think they have one but if you didn't figure it out after about <UNK> you're not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll br br i don't mind <UNK> movies but they've got to be going somewhere this one doesn't br br the plot wasn't what made this a direct to dvd movie that's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy br br the as of writing <UNK> ten 10 ratings must be from people involved with the production
<START> it's the f b i starring reed hadley with an all star guest cast the film begins with an accidental convenient kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn't really indicate the main story which is a big house u s a prison break story the story is very improbable to say the least it's like a tv show only more violent for the times br br but the cast is a trip picture this ralph <UNK> is sent to prison his cell mates are the following criminals <UNK> crawford <UNK> <UNK> jr charles bronson reading a muscle magazine and william <UNK> reading a detective magazine honest you should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending <UNK> if you don't want to have that hanging don't miss the opening scenes between the <UNK> and the boy peter <UNK> doing well as a runaway <UNK> br br big house u s a 1955 howard w <UNK> <UNK> crawford ralph <UNK> reed hadley
<START> branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic branagh plays <UNK> better than i've seen the character played in film or on stage some might say this film is overly <UNK> <UNK> but i disagree fishburne the first black othello in film history ironically delivers a powerful performance fishburne has always been a good actor but this performance as the <UNK> of <UNK> may be one of his best br br the one problem i have with this film is the simple <UNK> of a number of important scenes <UNK> character is given far less depth than she has in the play in this film she might as well not be added at all one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film was the <UNK> of a conversation between <UNK> and <UNK> at the beginning of the second act this part of the play shows that <UNK> may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film there were a number of <UNK> that hurt the integrity of this film br br however if you have not read the play or seen a film version of othello before i recommend this movie the story cut or not is still incredibly enthralling the acting as stated previously is very good if some important scenes had been added and <UNK> character been <UNK> a bit further this would be a great movie as it stands it's still an admirable version of the original i give it a <UNK> recommendation
<START> i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r but i thought zelah clarke too <UNK> and short this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed i have seen 4 versions orson welles is still my favorite mr r though george c scott did very well and it's a toss up between joan fontaine and <UNK> york although they were both a bit too old for the role i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and <UNK> fox i would love to see those two do jane eyre by the time i got to watching the <UNK> <UNK> version i think i was jane <UNK> out but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan <UNK> voice <UNK> the opening of the first version i ever saw i always want to go back and read the book again
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is in general a well established <UNK> we know well from books and movies this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not <UNK> mistake the cast isn't good the actors are over <UNK> and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and <UNK> that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious <UNK> who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing <UNK> <UNK> is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 woman in the <UNK> desert the <UNK> is not likable
<START> wow i <UNK> <UNK> 50 to go see this movie at the cinema cant believe i wasted my time the acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude <UNK> the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life i swear to god <UNK> <UNK> is better than this madonna should of won and oscar compared to these guys an hour and a half of my life i want back honestly people don't see this even <UNK> would find this movie an insult to their intelligence i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden <UNK> guys here of the actual puppets <UNK> guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it
<START> that's what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film first off the computer effects are absolutely mind blowing those computer <UNK> really deserve a pat on the back the rest of the movie though br br none of the characters act in a realistic manner especially in the aforementioned despicable 3rd act i promise i won't give it away but trust me it's not worth keeping a secret a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally like when they try to explain that an invisible man's <UNK> don't work please give the viewers more credit than that br br some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting what would you do after all if you were invisible no one could catch you these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933 there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once later on if more attention had been paid it kevin <UNK> mad scientist might have made a little more sense br br the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner but this piece of work go see something else or don't and live with the consequences br br 3 10
<START> and if you're very very good it will resemble moon over <UNK> br br this film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spot on dreyfuss was perfect as the actor <UNK> full of all the little <UNK> and <UNK> you imagine actors to have you get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes br br this was one of <UNK> best roles just like his character has his best role <UNK> the dead dictator and the <UNK> scene like something out of casablanca indeed br br <UNK> julia was superb as the <UNK> chief of secret police he gets some really funny lines some of which are <UNK> to other films like round up the usual suspects br br and <UNK> <UNK> was excellent as the girl friend in addition to being a really hot number you should get an oscar for tonight br br let us not forget johnny winters as the cia agent and the several guest stars playing themselves sammy davis jr <UNK> <UNK> dick <UNK> all perfectly done br br all in all a memorable romp under the <UNK> moon br br r
<START> i was unlucky enough to have seen this at the sidewalk film festival sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin being a <UNK> fan of lewis <UNK> <UNK> books i was very excited about this movie's <UNK> which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch normally i'm enthusiastic about modern re <UNK> if they are treated well usually it's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture <UNK> the adaptation of the <UNK> characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying it probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either most performances were ridiculously over the top which i assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script i did not laugh once through out the duration of the film all of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their <UNK> as time goes by really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of danny <UNK> work also i'd have to say that the <UNK> of the <UNK> game into a rave dance off was awful it was with out a doubt the low point of the film br br what a joke don't see this movie after its conclusion i was genuinely angry
<START> the story is extremely unique it's about these 2 pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time friends and <UNK> br br the ending could have been fantastic it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad br br the animation is decent for <UNK> but can't compare to nowadays i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity i actually found it to be somewhat decent the nudity for the most part was <UNK> except in episode 2 where there was an excess br br overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
<START> ok its not the best film i've ever seen but at the same time i've been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way br br and <UNK> deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling br br overall the film was pretty <UNK> but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it
<START> they all laughed is one of those little movies i am always <UNK> to friends seeking something out of the ordinary it is firmly <UNK> in the screwball romance traditions of the past but seems more contemporary even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet that reality never brings it crashing down to earth but that said this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going and <UNK> is blessed with a dream cast who understand the <UNK> of this sort of tale it is a movie that wouldn't <UNK> so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast <UNK> <UNK> simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog <UNK> novak <UNK> all that hair from under his hat and especially the moment dorothy <UNK> falls for john ritter and says how weird it's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of <UNK> it but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face
<START> this movie changed it all for me i heard of <UNK> and <UNK> but had never seen it <UNK> done hey i was an 11 year old kid from holland when i saw this movie this all changed i got <UNK> involved in the <UNK> movement in our city started <UNK> and writing lyrics br br to this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wide shot was filmed badly or if you could see a <UNK> hanging above somebody it's what it does to you personally that counts
<START> <UNK> miyazaki's second feature film and his first one to be widely acclaimed both <UNK> and <UNK> though his debut <UNK> aka warriors of the wind is considered by many fans his best <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> in the <UNK> may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like <UNK> delivery <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the <UNK> of modern anime it's important to remember that <UNK> in the <UNK> was made two years before the revolutionary <UNK> and while it's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero heroine villain type characters and the story is quite predictable and obvious at least in today's standards miyazaki's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before while the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable if not as breathtaking as <UNK> <UNK> and if you'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low budget <UNK> and animation and the identical twin faces at this point miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of japanese <UNK> you'll see miyazaki's genius shine through as well as it does on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> while <UNK> in the <UNK> being a sci fi adventure and very suitable for children fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since his <UNK> and principles still show and play an important part to say much more would be to ruin the movie so i'll kindly shut up suffice to say that i'm giving it only nine stars because if i gave it ten i couldn't go any higher for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and that would be a crime br br as in most anime movies i recommend watching the japanese version with the english subtitles even if you don't speak a word of japanese the english <UNK> just don't tend to be very good and in this case it's just horrendous you might want to watch it in the english version once though just for the laughs and for the star filled cast the english dub was only recorded following the success of <UNK> <UNK> as it was for <UNK> delivery <UNK> anna <UNK> and james van der <UNK> yeah the dawson guy fill the lead roles mark <UNK> luke skywalker from <UNK> <UNK> in case you don't know plays the villain and other roles are filled by andy dick <UNK> <UNK> the simpsons <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from kevin <UNK> robin hood travesty and mandy <UNK> hello my name is <UNK> <UNK> good for a laugh or a few laughs really but watch the japanese one first
<START> the original <UNK> is not by any means a great movie it had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic however it was entertaining better done than most low budget b movies and could be surprisingly witty unfortunately <UNK> ii is none of these br br <UNK> ii suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels the plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid it seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn't bother with anything else not even veteran b grade actors like tim <UNK> and <UNK> combs were able to drag this film out of the <UNK> br br a brief plot <UNK> jack <UNK> <UNK> is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the <UNK> of members of his government <UNK> ii takes place six years after the events of the first <UNK> jack <UNK> is married to lena helen hunt the woman he met in the first movie and both live with <UNK> <UNK> the man <UNK> was sent into the past to protect it is discovered that the brother of <UNK> the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of <UNK> people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill <UNK> <UNK> jack's mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop <UNK> brother and now jack finds himself working with her br br i have two real problems with this movie one is that the method of creating <UNK> in this movie is <UNK> different from the methods used in the first movie what makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of soviet <UNK> they act like it was always the technique br br the other thing that <UNK> me is that the love triangle between <UNK> lena and alice <UNK> jack's first wife is given very little screen time this bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie it felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie <UNK> character in particular seems very <UNK> with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he's re married making her either very shallow or very poorly written br br the only reason i can think of for watching this movie is if you're interested in watching the entire <UNK> series currently <UNK> six movies otherwise even if you're a fan of the original <UNK> stay away from this tepid sequel
<START> ok i know that the wanna be john hughes movies of the 80s were all <UNK> flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty low br br still after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can't seem to get out of my head br br i just sat through an 80s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them br br the acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of <UNK> an absolute insult and the <UNK> scenes <UNK> <UNK> and inaccurate br br unless you've got some <UNK> ally <UNK> or amanda pays or i guess rob lowe fetish there's really no reason to see this one
<START> just once i'd like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing <UNK> with the original poem yet again after watching this sci fi presentation i'm disappointed br br i'm not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to <UNK> a story based on what actually <UNK> the story is exciting enough why add plot elements that are non existent and ruin the story what's wrong with being faithful to the text br br grendel is <UNK> to weapons of any kind why introduce some super <UNK> that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer the fight with grendel was beowulf vs grendel that's it no one else took part in the battle the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons the mistake made by all previous <UNK> yet in this version danes and <UNK> fight the beast and beowulf <UNK> off <UNK> arm with a sword again why couldn't they portray what really happened personally i think a one on one <UNK> match between the two would be much more exciting br br overall this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is <UNK> to the true tale why add in a <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> mother that includes <UNK> offering why create extra characters like <UNK> that add nothing to the story there was no love story in the poem they couldn't even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no <UNK> under the lake they fail to notice the metaphor that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  it's supposed to be underground to represent hell why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot then that would be a truly great movie
<START> i gotta say clive <UNK> <UNK> is by far the best horror game to have ever been made i've played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and <UNK> games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game <UNK> its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is <UNK> the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at <UNK> is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a <UNK> system but alas poor pc sales <UNK> that one in the bud
<START> oh god what an idiotic movie incredibly cheap with fake special effects the creature is played by one guy in lame costume and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors ha ha ha they're simply ludicrous for example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more all in all this is a great entertainment if you're drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk i don't think so
<START> <UNK> in mexico are as common as <UNK> giving me their phone numbers so if you're rich then you'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita at first their relationship is a tad <UNK> but after a while creasy <UNK> up to the girl and the two develop a father daughter relationship one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a <UNK> <UNK> that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice br br keep some <UNK> next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right the only problem is the annoying visual style which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the <UNK> for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it's been possessed by demons i wouldn't have mind if the crappy visuals were <UNK> to a few action scenes but when it's spread through out the whole movie then that's when we have some problems the same annoying style was recently used on domino and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie br br another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry <UNK> williams who had the impossible task of trying to <UNK> music out of the <UNK> images somehow williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better the sound is <UNK> used throughout the movie and instead of <UNK> the movie experience it rather makes you feel like you're being <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an <UNK> low end sound coming out of it i don't know why scott thought the audience needed to be <UNK> by the <UNK> but it really takes you away from the movie br br the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart if the end of the movie doesn't make anyone cry then they're dead on the inside denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily for him he gets to play a great character the whole idea of a man that's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold <UNK> of revenge <UNK> mitchell plays marc <UNK> wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i can't hate the movie too much j <UNK> husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn't really stand out much mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact br br one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie a little too late for that if you ask me let's hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this
<START> boring long pretentious repetitive self involved  this move felt like a bad date worse the tedious art school direction with a heavy handed use of the <UNK> shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up  is constantly screaming to be noticed add the <UNK> of plots and virtually no dialogue and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in it gets worse instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice overs and quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters really loud opera music too blame it all on the director br br the actors are all quite good the lead actor <UNK> angel <UNK> is particularly suited for film stardom he and the other actors have some tender erotic moments even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however and one wonders if the director is <UNK> for a <UNK> <UNK> porn job the stunning college campus architecture as a location in mexico city is inspiring how come <UNK> in the us are so bland <UNK> <UNK> etc but wait for the dvd on this film you'll want to use the fast <UNK> button  a lot
<START> walking with <UNK> <UNK> by alec baldwin is a look back at all the <UNK> that's us species of the past 5 million years who they were what they were like and how they died out along with being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species walking with <UNK> also <UNK> what it is that makes us human i waited several weeks to watch this and i was not disappointed
<START> i loved the real <UNK> <UNK> 1957 1963 it is too bad that <UNK> reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony <UNK> i loved it when he called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons 2 6 if only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared god bless all the <UNK> members of the cast and please <UNK> reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real <UNK> <UNK> will live forever
<START> it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex <UNK> in society which can be bitter was shown very <UNK> it had a bitter kind of <UNK> in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more <UNK> and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening <UNK> to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them <UNK> the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you'll still love it all the same
<START> the 60's is a great movie i saw it completely in one night about the <UNK> movement in the late 60's although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this film br br the main character of the movie is michael a political <UNK> who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam war there he meets his girlfriend sarah michael's brother brian goes to vietnam to fight what a surprise he comes back from the war and changes in a tom cruise born on the fourth of july look a like and then into a <UNK> his dad is a pro vietnam war type of guy what a surprise michael's sister kate gets pregnant from a rock roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love the ending is very poor father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy but i let this slip away from my vote the rest of the movie is very good br br the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant all the main events of the sixties are in the movie like the murders on <UNK> and martin <UNK> king <UNK> as the big <UNK> <UNK> the summer of love and <UNK> look closely for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400 000 as a first aid employee at the <UNK> festival br br in the end the 60's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade 10 10
<START> i'm really <UNK> this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb it's one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself it's setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the 1980's were as good as moonstruck and it's funny too out of
<START> for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure the story starts at the turn of the century <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> colours of old photographs which <UNK> to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times i e the 1960s br br the story focuses on a boy in a remote <UNK> village who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an <UNK> during the <UNK> era he later joins the <UNK> after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village his son by the local beauty fights the germans during the second world war when he returns to the village the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic <UNK> br br this film is long and slow but utterly logic and very well made it can be seen in three parts
<START> i did enjoy this film i thought it ended up being an old fashioned love story with a few twists i expected him to get the girl i won't tell you if he does or not you will need to watch the movie to find out overall if you are looking to watch a love story this one will suffice
<START> what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show br br i'm sure you've all seen the matrix by now the creators of the matrix say that it is <UNK> <UNK> just from watching the trailer to this classic you can see where they took the plot from br br the film is sort of set in 1980s japan and it really shows the costumes music and words in the recent english language version by ad vision are all like they've been directly lifted from the era i believe it was made in that time also but due to certain plot points this doesn't date the film br br as you probably guessed by my <UNK> to the matrix the world isn't real it's not really the 1980's in fact it's something more like the <UNK> after a nuclear war the earth or <UNK> prime 's <UNK> was destroyed the survivors we're forced to escape into space where the conflict continued once the planets or <UNK> were all abandoned people began to live in <UNK> cities inside of <UNK> where via <UNK> techniques and truman show <UNK> illusion they were made to believe they we're back on earth in the most peaceful time in recent memory the 1980s when young <UNK> <UNK> a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle it leads him to find out more than he's supposed to know the garland a bike which becomes a <UNK> a weapon from the <UNK> aids <UNK> in his escape from the pursuing military as more and more is discovered about the <UNK> the war comes closer to home and due to conflicts between the military and the computer the war comes to the <UNK> too i <UNK> if those points are seen as spoilers but the plot is <UNK> basically that way on the synopsis br br emotions run high in this movie <UNK> than the matrix you really do believe the war is going on and <UNK> really does become quite <UNK> by what he's discovering what starts off as an uber happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and <UNK> these characters are real people not the cardboard <UNK> we saw flipping around in bullet time in the matrix there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy and a war it may just choke you up towards the end i know it did me br br animation is pretty impressive for it's day and the picture quality on the <UNK> dvd is unbelievable for it's age the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime very cultural be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood there's also an erotic sex scene br br the ending can be seen as a <UNK> can be no <UNK> similar to the matrix or supposedly can be followed by the sequel which i haven't yet had the pleasure of watching br br i have to say that this is one of the best <UNK> i've seen in fact one of the best movies i've seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest <UNK> of all time br br i must recommend the <UNK> dvd as their take on the english language is incredible and does the movie justice and can be purchased with an <UNK> for holding the two sequels when they are released which will have the same vocal cast br br all in all <UNK> 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be held highly and should be an essential in any anime <UNK> collection heck even my mother enjoyed it
<START> i saw the film at the <UNK> film festival last week and i'm still working off the trauma essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising well acted too natural my problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that i spent most of this time <UNK> in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and <UNK> at drunken <UNK> bread chewing <UNK> it's rather with the fact that they never warned me the festival <UNK> synopsis described only the utterly intriguing sounding first half hour a whore piano <UNK> and meat <UNK> chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending <UNK> <UNK> to come serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews i looked at post fact um didn't at all stress the <UNK> and utter <UNK> of the greater part of the film br br the first hint should have been the <UNK> words by the director a <UNK> <UNK> haired russian youth who stepped in front of the <UNK> <UNK> the film seems to be doing incredibly well <UNK> and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as i was of the pain to come judging by the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that utterly <UNK> the theatre during the last half hour and many <UNK> comments on exit to say the following <UNK> i um thank you very much for coming to see this film and i just wanted to say well it's a very long film it took me four years to make it and it's i suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it it is very long thank you for coming ' this is what he said alarm <UNK> should have been <UNK> <UNK> he talking about ' i thought in happy confusion <UNK> is gonna be fun ' of course by the time his strangely <UNK> comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out all i could do is <UNK> in increasing agony until the lights came on again and in the end i can't say i feel in any way improved by the experience yes i absolutely loved the first half hour it was intelligent new and had a lot to say and yes russia is probably in a bad state yes every society has many hidden faces yes <UNK> life in <UNK> <UNK> is probably <UNK> hard yes yes yes i get all of this really i do but i see no <UNK> reason why art and meaning should be so <UNK> drawn out and so painful to bear if you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of <UNK> hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> try the korean chinese bin <UNK> 3 iron it's artsy and surprising but also to the point and fun
<START> superb i had initially thought that given amrita <UNK> communist <UNK> and dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reverse br br kudos to <UNK> <UNK> for not being pseudo <UNK> and to dr <UNK> to be objective this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way <UNK> of any war are women as some poet said and this movie <UNK> it it is also a sad commentary on <UNK> psyche as they can't stand up against <UNK> of their girls or the <UNK> brother who can only burn the fields of his <UNK> on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind <UNK> or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place i think <UNK> thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new <UNK> will not be able to ask them to return the houses this apart one has to <UNK> the courage of characters of <UNK> and her <UNK> they are two simple village girls <UNK> of outside world and risk <UNK> by trying to come back after being <UNK> because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in india br br no wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women
<START> a series of vignettes most of them <UNK> television of the 1970's but also with some <UNK> at the government and corporate america one of the longest segments the dealers is not that funny to me and i don't know what it is <UNK> some of the others though are absolutely side splitting i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment most of the foul words i know are used in the movie and if you object to full frontal nudity stay away
<START> over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is england <UNK> football factory <UNK> and from london to <UNK> br br bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really <UNK> for it like the pursuit of happiness br br i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but don't we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot isn't it time these talented producers and writers give <UNK> youth something to <UNK> to and show them a better life is just around the corner br br i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not <UNK> the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors like <UNK> football factory but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned
<START> this movie has its ups and downs but to me the good stuff in this movie very much <UNK> the <UNK> br br what's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue the sounds the lighting am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were <UNK> was amateur and the acting br br what is very good are the highly original storyline the very intense atmosphere the gore factor which is very high and the effects which are done <UNK> br br so definitely worth watching or maybe even a must see for all you horror and gore fans
<START> daniel day lewis is christy brown a victim of cerebral <UNK> who uses my left foot to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film the movie also stars brenda <UNK> as <UNK> mother ray <UNK> <UNK> shaw and hugh <UNK> their brilliant performances great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of <UNK> br br brown was born into a lower middle class catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant 22 children in total 13 of whom survived his father considered christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped but he would not <UNK> his son to go into a home the children in the family would <UNK> goodbye to him each day as they went off to school and then his mother would feed him and talk to him br br in the movie <UNK> conveys the sense of a woman who despite being surrounded by a huge family needs someone to talk to christy doesn't talk back eventually a <UNK> is found for him to ride in and the neighborhood kids all of whom have known him since he was a baby include him in all of their activities the only part of his body that works really well is his left foot and when the kids find out how well he kicks they put him into soccer games for just that purpose one of the <UNK> parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him br br there are many powerful scenes but none as powerful as christy writing mother on the floor holding a piece of <UNK> between his <UNK> he's a true brown his father declares <UNK> him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub walking into the pub he <UNK> my son's a genius things change when christy grows older because he has a young boy's desires and emotions he develops <UNK> is rejected and goes more into himself turning to painting eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shaw at home he falls in love with her when he finds out she's engaged he nearly goes crazy but he survives to live to paint to write three books in total and to love again br br because it's a film by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined brown wasn't actually <UNK> with cerebral <UNK> for some time which was left out of the movie the <UNK> <UNK> is actually a combination of three important <UNK> figures in <UNK> life and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind in truth she worked very hard with christy when he was a child teaching him the <UNK> etc also before mary christy had a 12 year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated my left foot and the typical hollywood ending 9 years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor doesn't finish the story br br despite all of that christy <UNK> biopic is incredibly powerful all the more so because of two performances hugh <UNK> as young christy and daniel day lewis as the adult christy <UNK> facial expression and the way he drags his <UNK> body is gut wrenching one is exhausted for him and <UNK> at the same time br br and what can be said about daniel day lewis one of the greatest actors in the world he brings christy totally to life a fully fleshed out intelligent human being capable of swearing becoming angry bitter drunk <UNK> <UNK> funny and loving a well deserved oscar won in the same year that tom cruise was nominated for born on the fourth of july i remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that cruise was so sensational what was wrong with the academy uh nothing for a change nothing at all br br brenda <UNK> is amazing as <UNK> mother who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times the wonderful thing about <UNK> performance is that the support love and work <UNK> seem to come naturally to the mother the character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary <UNK> shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother and no matter what even when her husband is out of work throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant whatever she manages she saves money for <UNK> wheelchair she receives photos of her daughter and the baby she starts building a room for christy in the back of the house all part of a day's work a performance worthy of the oscar she received br br <UNK> life was more complicated than this inspiring film but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must see
<START> a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his <UNK> causes a car crash he escapes <UNK> but she is decapitated he saves her head brings it to his house and keeps it alive he then proceeds to search out models and <UNK> for the perfect body for the head his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a <UNK> or <UNK> link to a <UNK> monster kept in the closet br br as you can see this is pretty stupid stuff but i had a certain <UNK> for it when i grew up in the late 1970s a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year no exaggeration they showed it always on saturday afternoon tv uncut seeing this on tv back then was great explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy <UNK> who cares if it was good seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is br br the acting is perfectly wretched the production values are nonexistent the script is pretty dumb and aside from the still pretty disgusting gore this is dull stuff there's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film on the other its utter trash either way it's not a good movie but is a must see for one time only for horror and gore fans br br also the <UNK> laugh is pretty creepy note the end credits which gets the title wrong calling it the head that wouldn't die
<START> i have to admit that tsui <UNK> is one of a kind you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence a chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of zu mountain and this is what he displayed br br the new legend of zu has truly improved from the one in 1983 from this new <UNK> update we could see tsui <UNK> vision of the zu mountains spectacular visual designs amazing action fantasy epic made beautifully well kept me glued through the entire picture great cast with just fine acting it's truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weird br br now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line <UNK> down into a 95 minute movie plot may not have much relation among characters but by <UNK> the movie you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself some can complain there isn't too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat <UNK> spirits fighting by hand to hand wouldn't really make sense at all br br i appreciated this nice stylish picture it may have a thin story but hey look at tsui <UNK> time tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome tsui <UNK> always <UNK> something different into h k cinema american audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ain't no <UNK> tiger hidden dragon this is a whole new genre although it may not be a masterpiece but it's special effects is truly better than storm riders this is really worth checking out
<START> police story is a stunning series of set pieces for jackie chan to show his unique talents and bravery some of the stunts here are among <UNK> best and most dangerous the whole mall fight finale is probably <UNK> greatest single fight sequence more brutal and less comedic then say project a or drunken master at the end of the fight you can almost feel the pain of the impact br br but unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't hold up to this quality as it is a rather formulaic cop thriller with some comedy elements i always prefer <UNK> in films such as project a where his natural comic talents shine through in the serious confines of some elements of police story it just doesn't work for me having said that though this is still up there with <UNK> best films due to the incredible stunt work and sheer spectacle br br as usual with hong kong films avoid the english dubbed dvd version as it is truly awful stick with the subtitles br br great stunts ok movie a fine starting point if you've not seen a <UNK> movie before and well worth a watch for any movie fan 7 10
<START> save your money i have been a fan of <UNK> productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie <UNK> seen <UNK> the 80's this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it
<START> does this film suck horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible nothing redeeming here for even the most die hard of horror fans a crazy killer stalks students at a college people are showing up dead in the <UNK> but still class carries on as normal after about the 4th body i would think that they could allow the students a few days break lol this about as bad as it gets folks this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals you have been warned
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tsui <UNK> a chinese ghost story aside from being one of the greatest <UNK> <UNK> films ever made is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an <UNK> choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film <UNK> collection the sorely missed hong kong superstar leslie cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple while staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the <UNK> <UNK> wu ma and <UNK> <UNK> the tree devil and the beautiful ghost lit sin seen played by the lovely joey wong br br to free her from the <UNK> of the evil tree devil he must <UNK> her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon br br enough good things can't be said about this film the pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the <UNK> paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe the chemistry between the wonderfully tragic joey wong and leslie cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them indeed the acting on the whole is so <UNK> and full of life i would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences i've ever had much of the credit goes to wu ma in his portrayal of the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> his over the top persona of a <UNK> <UNK> hell bent on <UNK> evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional hk drama a wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> round out this wonderful film find a copy anywhere you can 10 10
<START> this book based movie is truly awful and a big disappointment we've been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in <UNK> and tv it made big sense when <UNK> april comes many people <UNK> noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so <UNK> it has been many <UNK> scenes sometimes it's hard to realize what's going on the actresses out of <UNK> <UNK> weren't <UNK> with their roles especially <UNK> <UNK> she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldn't <UNK> of her previous role and finally movie is too short just <UNK> minutes
<START> here let me wave my hands over the keyboard i'll tell you what <UNK> she's going to order over and over works like a charm he's such a genius <UNK> how does he do it my <UNK> <UNK> freaks if i even pass this show when i'm <UNK> channels i have to be very careful these days it's useful far too often so i don't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this careful with that remote is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of <UNK> control and <UNK> or what why does it exist br br this is the most inane show completely unbelievable and contrived and i cannot understand why it's still on the air so may <UNK> give so much better shows such a hard time sarah connor chronicles true blood but give this nonsensical drivel a pass shows like <UNK> if there were any like that fall away after a season but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps <UNK> on <UNK>
<START> if i sit down i will never stand up again that's what the mother the one of the title says to his son when he tells her to get some rest she's just widowed he means that <UNK> is what a woman of his age and in her situation has to do to rest in peace to neglect herself but she's not in the mood for <UNK> not yet she also has a daughter who <UNK> her for each and every disasters in her life suddenly the revelation comes sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her daniel craig the brand new james bond when she thought nobody would ever touch her again it is a story that makes you reflect on many things specially on what's a 60 something woman is supposed to do with her life when his husband dies it doesn't look that we've advanced that such in those aspects i mean <UNK> surprised when sean connery has a love affair in a movie with catherine zeta jones but what would you think if it was otherwise an old woman a young guy <UNK> you ain't ready for that are you br br the movie has <UNK> tones all along its length except for 2 or 3 sequences in which that tones breaks and out comes some explicit and foul mouthed dialogs those vulgar touches and the way the son and the daughter find out their mother's love affair pretty absurd you'll know what i mean when you watch it are the only <UNK> elements in the mother br br my rate 7 10
<START> the acting wasn't great the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters it's about the <UNK> of the struggle between right wing <UNK> block voters on the one side and the <UNK> people living in the <UNK> city <UNK> on the other side is it a political analysis is it some kind of <UNK> west side story or modern romeo and juliet the film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions <UNK> those were the director's questions too still some of the scenes could function as a kind of ken <UNK> film set in <UNK> after all this city has been the starting point of the <UNK> right wing <UNK> block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different <UNK> and cultures it's very difficult to make a film about this situation and this one isn't successful unfortunately still it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present day <UNK> the few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social <UNK> lines behind it that haunt <UNK> a 10 million people country in the <UNK> br br <UNK> van <UNK>
<START> i read this <UNK> wilder play last year in <UNK> grade i was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen let me tell you it's not a terrific play it is easily <UNK> but man it deserves a much better shot the acting was really lacking the scenery honest to god looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three year olds as if it couldn't get worse the sound quality is lousy there is this mind numbing <UNK> whenever an actor speaks and i also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between george and emily well is non <UNK> the actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there there is no music it is in black and white which would be ok but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more in any case i think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie which i don't really <UNK> then don't aim your hopes to high the play as <UNK> as it is is probably better
<START> if john <UNK> had never played morse <UNK> or starred in the <UNK> and other productions he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in <UNK> mr tom br br superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co star young nick robinson in his first role and an <UNK> cast this adaptation of michelle <UNK> charming novel is a fitting <UNK> to his art br br when i read this story of an old widowed <UNK> <UNK> having to <UNK> a young boy from london before and during the <UNK> i found a rather obvious time line error in it and credit must go to the makers of this film for <UNK> this error they also must be <UNK> for not over <UNK> the tale and <UNK> what could have been turned quite easily into a <UNK> mess br br if you keep a cd or video library then this feel good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> have provided us with a serious <UNK> and painful analysis of the social spiritual economic and political crisis that <UNK> years of <UNK> have <UNK> in puerto rico a beautiful island with the most <UNK> people i have met and yet because our nation refuses to faces its <UNK> <UNK> puerto <UNK> are allowed to <UNK> and die br br the spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of puerto rico has created if <UNK> families and the basic <UNK> that sustain any society corruption is rampant to the extent that people are not paying <UNK> which has led a <UNK> crisis for this nation and a sense of cynicism and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> culture br br fortunately a grant allowed this painful yet powerful film to be produced br br a must see
<START> it's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing but an ordinary sex drama so it's a <UNK> sexual thriller in which nothing is what it seems it features <UNK> <UNK> no stranger to the genre and to nudity in which her husband polanski had directed her and a creepy performance did i say creepy yes creepy from <UNK> bernard <UNK> actor it looks like a <UNK> <UNK> meets roman polanski better than bitter moon like a <UNK> gone <UNK> or <UNK> thriller i have seen someone mentioning les <UNK> but closer to georges <UNK> les <UNK> sans <UNK> eyes without a face the godfather of dr <UNK> and more a gem i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with <UNK> and the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinema br br this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make a <UNK> <UNK> br br in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh <UNK> voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illness br br still the movie <UNK> had proper character development plus cinematography <UNK> good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a high budget the script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the movie br br the new <UNK> shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography br br a talented actor like <UNK> <UNK> has been wasted in the movie as well as <UNK> <UNK> br br but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad film br br so watch it only if you are a fan of multi <UNK> flop movies
<START> i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful especially since it was based on a true man pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl the photography was beautiful br br this movie made me do more research into this character <UNK> <UNK> known simple as grey owl i want to read as much as i can about him at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it but i am not surprised i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing i gave it the highest rating however i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house br br you can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes
<START> my wife and i found this film to be highly unsatisfying while the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on when you leave the theater there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all spoilers ahead christopher plummer enormously wealthy head of a ny bank has a terrible hidden secret <UNK> from <UNK> ii deals with the nazis and hiding <UNK> stolen from jews he keeps the evidence including <UNK> and documents with the nazi <UNK> in a safety <UNK> box in his bank why if he wants this never to be revealed why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago and the <UNK> obviously he does not need them why keep them rather than <UNK> of them how did the bank robbers find out his secret how did they know to zero in on this very safety <UNK> box <UNK> ace detective denzel washington also discovers bank records show <UNK> boxes <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but no <UNK> curious he <UNK> found time somehow to do an <UNK> search of bank records to <UNK> this one curious fact all the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start <UNK> them <UNK> wow talk about super powers for a detective br br the bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose <UNK> in the vault they have opened they take only the <UNK> of <UNK> box <UNK> ostensibly for the purpose of <UNK> the bank president this defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind or for his henchmen with lesser brains br br jodie foster using her political connections with the mayor of nyc <UNK> <UNK> to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many <UNK> she offers the chief bank <UNK> a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand but he ain't interested so what's his point if any br br my wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players christopher plummer bank president denzel washington ace detective and jodie foster crack trouble <UNK> for high powered problems br br the last jodie foster movie i saw flight plan was also <UNK> with holes that made no sense at all i thought i liked jodie foster but i will probably avoid her future films br br now my problem is that i can rarely <UNK> my wife to go to the movies i cannot disagree with her on this one a waste of money and a waste of time be <UNK> a well crafted film fine actors lousy script writing
<START> this was the worst film i have seen for a long time br br not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies the story is obvious flat and absolutely not funny br br the girls are nice though but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film br br this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad made for an audience that is not older than 12 br br i never visited an american college but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes br br save your time do something else
<START> i don't often give one star reviews but the computer won't let me do negative numbers br br the opening titles tell us we're in deep water already although this is a low budget exploitation film there are 17 producers credited no no br br at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an <UNK> <UNK> community the house is a <UNK> his wife della kim basinger has let the children run amok all day br br ok we're already in deep water ms basinger was <UNK> years old when the film came out uh are these her children or <UNK> it's christmas eve della drives to the mall a lengthy scene that could have been cut to <UNK> home the idea of <UNK> male <UNK> rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in <UNK> rain on christmas eve sure for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it br br we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes though it's <UNK> and traffic is bad first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time at one point turning completely around to check the <UNK> back seat for the <UNK> for the phone br br she wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is <UNK> gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke but that's too complicated for the script to follow br br in the parking lot she runs <UNK> of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films one white boy lukas <UNK> watching his career go down the toilet one black one asian and one hispanic imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you'll have the idea br br although they have a gun she gives them attitude a mall cop comes to investigate the <UNK> and they shoot him in the head firing more than once the parking lot is crowded as can be people everywhere and nobody notices br br della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well <UNK> safe area she drives to a construction site where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools literally at hand br br major spoiler ahead br br she drives back home the car <UNK> out so she walks through the <UNK> rain <UNK> on the children goes <UNK> and when her husband <UNK> asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range br br the experience with the four <UNK> was supposed to result in personal <UNK> for della instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges the four <UNK> can be classified as <UNK> homicide in self defense the husband different story br br i'm so glad i saw this on cable if i'd seen it in a theater did it get any release i'd have been furious as is i'm just sad seeing talents like ms basinger and mr <UNK> waste themselves on garbage like this br br one very good thing though this was written and directed by susan <UNK> ms <UNK> has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd there is justice in the world
<START> when it comes to the erotic genre i'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis i love you don't touch me directed two very strong lead actors <UNK> reed and doug <UNK> in this enthralling thriller <UNK> is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug <UNK> the man a handsome stranger <UNK> loses control of her <UNK> in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie <UNK> direction is a great gift to <UNK>
<START> in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the <UNK> spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you <UNK> we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that <UNK> and courage will get us through that's what this film did for me and i hope it will for you
<START> i read the book 7 years in <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> and was fascinated of it then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie i remember the first time i saw it back in 98 i kinda liked it well now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on and soon i realized how wrong it all was told br br when they enter <UNK> the people start to stick their <UNK> out of their mouths and <UNK> and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in <UNK> so they <UNK> back in the book <UNK> explains that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute <UNK> and loyalty in <UNK> and they may do it in front of the <UNK> <UNK> but certainly not for these two europeans not only the mother but even the <UNK> <UNK> himself was wearing glasses in the public in the book <UNK> mentions that no one in <UNK> wore glasses to that time sorry forgot the reason but its explained in the book too the young <UNK> <UNK> did but only when he was alone and nobody could see him and what about that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> destroying the <UNK> in front of the young living <UNK> childish and the <UNK> made <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> clothes not european designer suits why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story just to fill the time with a fictional love interest the female <UNK> that is completely <UNK> just like the whole story about <UNK> son <UNK> not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of <UNK> in the book but that was ok for me because 7 years in <UNK> is not a book about <UNK> person its about <UNK> i'm very disappointed by this adaption of the famous book and i bet <UNK> <UNK> was too 3 stars just for the cinematography
<START> first i want to <UNK> that the average <UNK> inability to appreciate imagination is appalling what makes this show so unique is the hyper reality it creates you don't need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute where has the <UNK> of childhood whimsical tales gone much like a <UNK> in time br br i say it is <UNK> original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay it all out television that leaves no room for imagination or wonder br br it's nice to add a bit of <UNK> to the television experience br br the hyper reality is my favorite aspect of the show the 1950's <UNK> setting the innocent and rare characters and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure reality br br this show masks the morbid nature of death while others embrace it while entertaining other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series it truly has restored a sense of curiosity imagination and wonder to television br br pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list
<START> i must admit that i was very <UNK> about this documentary i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much i was wrong this is not propaganda in fact it is hardly political at all br br it depicts the events of 9 11 through the eyes of the <UNK> called to the scene just after the planes crashed it is an amazing <UNK> that this documentary was filmed at all this film was initially shot as a <UNK> about a rookie ny <UNK> becoming a man we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them br br a great piece of work absolutely stunning material highly recommended br br regards
<START> about a year and a half ago my dad told me about the french doors i thought it sounded interesting enough but i didn't try to find it anywhere then about a year ago i remembered that film and thought hey why not and tried finding it on the internet eventually after about a week of looking i found it on <UNK> films i called my dad over to the computer and said to him hey dad i've found that creepy film you told me about ages ago he <UNK> at me turned round turned off the lights so it was pitch black apart from the computer screen and told me to watch it i started off fine then when he started getting worried about whatever was there i found it very unnerving at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up it made me jump p if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend you do because it is well worth it even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling br br great film
<START> it surprises me that i actually got the courage to watch the bio flick or flicks che parts 1 2 why because if my cuban <UNK> parents would ever found out i saw this movie about this despicable mass murderer of the cuban revolution i would be grounded for life hey wait i am an adult they can't ground me no <UNK> director steven soderbergh and <UNK> <UNK> sorry steven but i had to take <UNK> shots here <UNK> the movie in two <UNK> on commander <UNK> che <UNK> revolutionary life che part 1 presents how che in the mid 1950's joined <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crew in their revolutionary quest to <UNK> cuban president <UNK> <UNK> regime which as we all know was a revolutionary success for them but a <UNK> <UNK> disaster to many <UNK> as it <UNK> into communism che part 2 presents che trying to <UNK> the t shirt industry by <UNK> t shirts with his appalling <UNK> face to t shirt <UNK> ok i am che <UNK> a lot of crap towards your way i meant to say the <UNK> part 2 focuses on che in the late 60's trying to bring back the revolution this time to a poverty stricken bolivia but with far different results in fact che ended up being dead meat <UNK> when he was captured and killed by the <UNK> <UNK> in 1967 soderbergh does not include the in between time of those two instances in che's life when he <UNK> the despicable la <UNK> <UNK> prison in cuba where he mass murdered many <UNK> who opposed communism that is where i think soderbergh executed a cinematic injustice by not showing the viewers how atrocious guevara really was i did decide to see che in hopes that soderbergh would not <UNK> him but instead present how disturbed he really was unfortunately soderbergh did not do the latter and sadly decided to present guevara as a revolutionary hero which he was not he was a sick man who thank god is now probably at the bottom of the devil barrel now i do have to be an <UNK> reviewer and must admit that <UNK> del <UNK> performance as che was extremely commanding and worthy of merit and that <UNK> <UNK> was a haunting dead <UNK> as <UNK> castro in his <UNK> performance but the rest of the cast of che was primarily comprised of mediocre performances of actors portraying <UNK> soldiers and as much as i do admire matt damon why did <UNK> throw him in the revolutionary mix in a spanish speaking cameo performance portraying a <UNK> <UNK> soderbergh did not have to present this biopic which is mostly too much talk and not enough action in 4 hours and 30 minutes we have had too much of che already even <UNK> with those ridiculous t shirts so why give us too much more of him but i guess when you have the del toro by the <UNK> as you did here steven i guess it is your saving grace for not totally <UNK> che parts 1 2 average
<START> the concept for <UNK> appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the <UNK> of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never <UNK> such rapid shifts between <UNK> and terror had it simply been a drama <UNK> these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs br br aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a disappointment br br 3 10
<START> if a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed you need not look for it you will find all and more in this near perfect presentation of charlotte <UNK> masterpiece br br rarely have i seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based but i admit to that here although i have not read jane eyre i am convinced that i have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion i only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has <UNK> within me br br i need not <UNK> anything in the way of plot here let me just say this if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is jane eyre i <UNK> you to doubt no more every <UNK> of might and magic that has <UNK> jane eyre as a popular classic of english literature has successfully been captured in this film br br what <UNK> did not bring herself clarke and dalton managed to translate in the <UNK> with <UNK> intensity the movie's success is no doubt due in no small part to their acting <UNK> br br love jane eyre or hate her but appreciate the <UNK> the <UNK> the truth of the story love the characters love the actors all just as you would love what is great in cinema
<START> this isn't the best bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the sci fi channel this is quality stuff it has some action some humor decent f x and bigfoot cg is used but so are some practical f x which i like br br overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of b horror sci fi and need a fix it's better than the movie sasquatch and not a sequel to it so don't be fooled br br the acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate expect a bit of a <UNK> as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up if you are watching a dvd you may want to skip a chapter or two
<START> here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel poverty <UNK> existence robin <UNK> <UNK> out by the police for <UNK> because they were a <UNK> wild at times <UNK> according to this crap bonnie was the <UNK> little thing west of the <UNK> who was taught to be a <UNK> murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt anybody he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them badly acted poorly filmed unbelievable dialogue unrealistic use of <UNK> gore that looked more like <UNK> <UNK> than the real thing avoid this <UNK> thumbs down 5 stars
<START> <UNK> <UNK> beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a <UNK> <UNK> on a rich man's land spirited bold she captures the heart of the <UNK> son but violence terror sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness br br mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid heart wrenching film she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the <UNK> joy enthusiasm which made her for years the world's most popular movie star the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale with mary the lovely <UNK> heroine <UNK> by all manner of dangerous <UNK> situations the <UNK> are first rate with the <UNK> fishing village sets being particularly well conceived br br in the supporting cast jean <UNK> stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him <UNK> a very gentle soul off screen manages brilliantly to depict his character's complete moral corruption br br this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess a <UNK> version had been one of her first important films but its production values were a bit <UNK> by the standards of the <UNK> no close ups for instance and mary producing her own films powerful enough by <UNK> to make whatever film she wanted decided for the only time in her career to remake a film the end result certainly lived up to her expectations both films were very popular at the box office br br a fascinating study for some future film <UNK> would be the influence of christianity in mary <UNK> life it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced although the <UNK> inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today we are compelled to accept them as sincere <UNK> by their very <UNK> of <UNK> heartfelt beliefs in tess one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible she <UNK> to lloyd hughes who plays her sweetheart a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand he <UNK> it for her the word is obviously <UNK> and eyes turned <UNK> as the full meaning of the sacrifice <UNK> upon her <UNK> face becomes positively <UNK> br br a splendid new <UNK> score for tess has been <UNK> by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly <UNK> the beauty pathos of this wonderful film
<START> this movie has great fight scenes now its true that the acting is a little rough but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of <UNK> and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix then watch this now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li p s his pants and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire
<START> tedious girls at <UNK> school flick which plays somewhat like a prison movie chris linda blair is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father once in the de <UNK> jail she is gang raped by her fellow female inmates br br overlong even at 98 minutes with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless br br 15 year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when <UNK> but lets a <UNK> shot slip during a shower scene br br 1 2 out of
<START> if you're a t rex marc <UNK> fan i recommend you check this out it shows a whimsical side of marc <UNK> as well as <UNK> <UNK> apparently having a pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren't part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with a sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown a talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls watching him in concert you would never know that being a rock star is a job but just having a great time playing some great songs with some good friends like <UNK> john and <UNK> <UNK> appearing in some of the live performances true there are a few songs missing that i would like to have seen on there but like any album it can't have everything i just bought this in 2006 but if i would have know it came out in 1972 i would have definitely bought it years ago sad and strange that a man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in a car crash
<START> i sat with my children as we watched this film we all found it to be a very entertaining movie br br when billy goes to a new school a fifth grade bully starts stuff with him and this is what leads to the eating of worms br br a bet is made and billy has only so much time to eat 10 worms or else from this point the bully and his friends try to come up with nasty ways to cook <UNK> or <UNK> the worms to try and get billy sick so that he will lose the bet br br billy stays strong and eats his way into becoming liked more and more by everyone even the bullies friends br br i wont tell you if he wins the bet or not you will just need to watch it to find out but i will think that if you like good family movies you will like this one br br p s let me add that this movie is not just for boys i have all daughters and they really liked it a lot
<START> take your basic frankenstein flick <UNK> some <UNK> but not the good parts and you have doctor <UNK> certainly this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never <UNK> as anything special on its own br br a scientist accidentally kills his wife so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife to revive his wife he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and <UNK> decide to stay the night at his place br br i can't really say the acting is bad nor is the directing everything here is just way too standard what little attempts there are at humor actually work check out the scene when <UNK> keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him <UNK> a woman and a <UNK> but that's hardly enough to recommend this film the music is decent what blood that's there is decent and the cast looks quite good and for half of the time i was even entertained by this film but i never felt like this was anything more than a time <UNK> <UNK> br br try <UNK> instead
<START> well tremors i the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch however they <UNK> to make tremors ii and iii trust me those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one i mean ass <UNK> now only god himself is capable of answering the question why in gods name would they create another one of these <UNK> <UNK> of a movie tremors iv cannot be considered a bad movie in fact it cannot be even considered an epitome of a bad movie for it lives up to more than that as i attempted to sit though it i noticed that my eyes started to bleed and i hoped <UNK> that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the tv and kill me did they really think that dressing the people who had <UNK> in the other movies up as though they we're from the wild west would make the movie with the exact same <UNK> any better honestly i would never suggest buying this movie i mean there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well
<START> you know you're in for something different when a movie has christopher walken playing the part of a professional hit man and he isn't even one of the bad guys although it could do with some <UNK> <UNK> here and there man on fire is a generally effective crime drama that <UNK> in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal and just about every tone imaginable in between br br denzel washington stars as creasy a former cia assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed so far he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the bible and not doing all that well with either as the movie opens mexico city has been <UNK> by a series of <UNK> aimed at the powerful and well to do possibly <UNK> by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety the first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between creasy and his charge pita a sweet little girl who slowly but surely works her way into <UNK> initially hardened heart and affections the last two thirds of the film turns into an <UNK> angel melodrama as creasy <UNK> seeks out and <UNK> all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story br br based on the novel by a j <UNK> man on fire <UNK> written by brian <UNK> and <UNK> directed by tony scott is a <UNK> efficient action picture that never <UNK> away from the raw brutality of its subject matter it takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is for all <UNK> and purposes achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering admittedly <UNK> people these scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful even if they do at times border on the exploitative even better are the quiet intimate moments between creasy and pita in the early parts of the movie washington and the wonderful <UNK> fanning establish an natural <UNK> <UNK> that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow br br washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic <UNK> making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing <UNK> us intellectually in addition to the two leads there are solid performances from walken marc anthony <UNK> mitchell mickey rourke rachel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but it is washington and the delightful ms fanning who steal the show br br man on fire would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time but this is still a better than average crime thriller
<START> after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting all in all don't plan on <UNK> your friends by picking this one as a <UNK> for a movie night
<START> possible plot spoilers br br i adore dennis hopper i question why he accepted the role of a police detective in <UNK> the <UNK> ground this movie flat out sucks and i'm about to tell you why br br this is about a small town which is about to get a contract for a sports <UNK> one <UNK> there's a killer on the loose and that is bad for business the mayor makes a deal with the irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court <UNK> ed <UNK> has other plans he wants this guy caught too but he's on the level and believes in the system he wants to see the system do it's job br br that could have been pretty good it could have been riveting it was horrible first they label this guy a serial killer <UNK> no there are specific <UNK> and none of it fits here the bad guy has killed 5 kids the first day and i think it was 2 the second day this entire movie <UNK> like a 48 hour time period hardly serial killer action i don't care what <UNK> motives they give him in the end serial killers do their deed over a long time span they do not just all of a sudden kill 7 kids in two days that's a spree br br ok that <UNK> aside the acting was atrocious the only name here was hopper and he's the only one who came even close to pulling off his part unfortunately he's kinda type cast to me and i think he does psycho parts much much better this just wasn't a good vehicle for hopper it didn't allow him to do what he does best which is to act all creepy it's not that he did bad it's that i've seen him do so much better br br the irish mob guy johnny <UNK> tom <UNK> long day's journey into night who is in charge of their investigation is just over the top stiff <UNK> not really he is trying to play the cold hard kinda guy and he does that to the point that the character is just wooden boring to the max he didn't scare me he didn't inspire any emotion at all except boredom i cannot tell you how many times i checked to see how much longer it was <UNK> the end of this movie br br the other thing about this is that it had the feel of a made for tv movie you know what i mean the poor production values low budget re use of scenes to save costs just eh <UNK> but i feel like comparing this to those is an insult to those br br derek <UNK> was both the director and cinematographer on this project he bit off more than he could chew i can't help feeling that hopper must have took this role as a personal favor to a friend that's the only rational i can come up with this was <UNK> first job as director third as cinematographer hopefully this was a learning experience for him br br i won't ruin the ending in case you do decide to torture yourself with this one but i do want to say that they all dropped the ball here even hopper in a scene that should have been emotionally gut wrenching for the detective it was just well blah i didn't see any of the angst at all that would <UNK> the total gear change this guy made very disappointing br br this 100 <UNK> minutes long and rated r for violence and language no kid under 13 is going to have any interest whatsoever in watching this so no <UNK> there it's not suitable for anyone anyway <UNK> br br skip this one you'll thank me later
<START> this film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it it was sort of a remake but then again not really i was very disappointed considering the tools that tim burton has at his <UNK> he had great make up and cgi available and lots of money 100 million but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than 6 million heck no so in that regard the film fails br br at least in the original film the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming and by the way if you give it some thought and i did you can figure out how the ending could come about i just wish i had back the time that i wasted thinking about it br br this film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of beneath the planet of the apes here's how i would have written it br br an astronaut it really should have been more than <UNK> mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so i would have put in three guys that would land on what they would think would be another planet encounter humans not <UNK> a city ruled by apes were hunted made friends with some good apes discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes and then well let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it br br but my point is that there could have been so much more to this film sadly tim burton really knows how to wreck a good thing consider what he did with the batman series he's a rotten director <UNK> what of people think he's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking sorry but no if anyone else had done this film it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying
<START> this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene incoherent would be a compliment even the end made no sense but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over i watched it with a kind of <UNK> fascination to see if it could continue to <UNK> and it did by the end of this mess i was sorry any of the characters survived and i wasn't feeling too <UNK> about the actors either if you want to watch a train wreck i recommend hanging out at a train station even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess apparently i haven't <UNK> enough to fill up my <UNK> ten lines so at the risk of <UNK> i will say it one more time this movie is a zero and it would be less if i had a word for an even lower rating how about minus zero
<START> the marriage of maria <UNK> <UNK> is about a german girl maria getting married to a german soldier herman <UNK> just at the ending of the war after being married for half a day and a night herman is send to the front again to make ends meet maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier she got word that herman died at the front and things develop between her and the american soldier herman walks in on them in bed and after a confrontation between him and the american maria killed the american herman admits to the murder ends up in jail and maria <UNK> to wait for him the country is in <UNK> one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette there are food <UNK> it is in short a time of survival of the <UNK> br br basically this film projects <UNK> attitudes those attitudes she <UNK> herself under the mentioned circumstances as a metaphor for <UNK> loss of soul after they lost the war and how it proceeds to <UNK> itself for example maria has the following conversation with a <UNK> played by fassbinder himself the <UNK> tries to sell her an excellent copy of <UNK> and she remarks that <UNK> burns out to quickly it does not provide enough heat for the cold the <UNK> answers that's another way to look at it right now it's probably the correct way br br maria meets a french german business man karl <UNK> after she <UNK> her way into the first class train <UNK> she decides to get involve with karl you're not having an affair with me i'm having an affair with you she also takes responsibility in the company and after a while has the complete trust of the firm when karl says i suppose we'll just have to wait for a miracle she replies i prefer making <UNK>  then wait for them in her own words she has become the <UNK> <UNK> of the economic miracle br br in a lot of <UNK> films he tried to expose the psychological <UNK> which lie behind social <UNK> see <UNK> in other words he liked pointing his camera at the <UNK> t the false social <UNK> the pretending the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology for example she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point i need someone to sleep with as fassbinder said the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly <UNK> members of society he also <UNK> that his films are anti emotional br br i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the <UNK> restaurant apparently frequently visited by hitler himself maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side as if <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wears him out as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore karl says i have to tell myself over and over that i love life maria replies that's life isn't it as if we signed a contract to enjoy life and then we go out to eat and talk about food i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships to never submit completely to anyone and why would you if the central matter of most of his films is about what love becomes in this society  a <UNK> an <UNK> of power a weapon br br it was <UNK> that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and <UNK> walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war with these clothing essentially the wrong period what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great but fassbinder was not interested in perfection any mistakes made in a film could just be <UNK> in the next project since he completed films approximately 4 a year the way other people rolled <UNK> it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes peter <UNK> who wrote most of the script mentioned that fassbinder likely <UNK> up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park overnight br br <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant as maria mostly she just stares <UNK> into the camera in <UNK> own words it is a bad time for emotions but i like it like that br br there are different opinions about the end after karl died of a hart attack herman finally shows up herman left for australia after he got out of prison to become human again after the testament is delivered made out to her and herman in half maria forgets to close the gas on the <UNK> when she lights her cigarette and blow her and herman up for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident at the same time she must have been <UNK> when her dreams finally seem about to come true she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore she felt as if she had <UNK> herself
<START> this was the best documentary i've ever seen i just saw <UNK> of <UNK> and wanted to know more about <UNK> <UNK> and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well great job <UNK> i was kicking back at work last week bored o less and this movie came on growing up in orange county in the 80's i <UNK> up and down the local <UNK> and so did my dad when he was a teenager i grew up at the beach my parents took me every weekend i body <UNK> <UNK> then moved up from there this movie just captivated me it was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went through true <UNK> this movie is a <UNK> item
<START> worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible <UNK> violent overlong mess scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone <UNK> and door <UNK> gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master <UNK> the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced nick <UNK> plays the <UNK> lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone de <UNK> psychotic <UNK> is nothing more than the typical 90's movie psycho killer the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies one of my most horrible movie experiences rent the original it's 100 times better br br
<START> this is almost certainly the worst western i've ever seen the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films hero learns that family friends have been murdered so hero sets out to exact revenge <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the kidnapped loving damsel and murders the expert arch nemesis in a brutal duel this formula has often been successful otherwise it wouldn't be a formula but <UNK> is the most <UNK> execution of it you'll ever see the scripting is <UNK> simple minded and insulting it sounds like a high <UNK> wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth maturity and realism the sound is bad it sometimes looks dubbed the cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just <UNK> the acting is pitiful sure some of the performers could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse i hope i never see chris <UNK> in a speaking role ever again every time he says a line that should be angry or mean he does nothing more than lower the <UNK> of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho and speaking of chris <UNK> who plays <UNK> check out his <UNK> if you dare to watch this film he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working down and dirty cowboy if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined <UNK> of <UNK> cassidy then get this but if you have more than two <UNK> watch something else
<START> this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen i love the backwoods feel of this movie the movie is very realistic and believable this seems to take place in another era maybe the late 60's or early 70's henry thomas works well with the young baby very moving story and worth a look
<START> spoiler br br i saw this <UNK> film a few years back its a lovely story about a young <UNK> who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it he ends up <UNK> after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who <UNK> her throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get <UNK> and you have a <UNK> yet warm story about love friendship and lovely <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br its brilliant br br dont be put off by sub <UNK> les <UNK>
<START> to put it simply the fan was a disappointment it felt like as if i was watching taxi driver except taxi driver was much better than this it seemed like the filmmakers wanted us to root for robert <UNK> character 100 percent this approach didn't work
<START> <UNK> grant <UNK> who would go on to star in the great b movie killer <UNK> from outer space agrees to help three middle aged guys learn how to <UNK> the ladies in this bad <UNK> comedy not bad as in <UNK> <UNK> which meant good bad as in bad with no likable characters including but not limited to a kid who's the <UNK> looking guy since friday the 13th part 2 ' a girl who leads men on and then goes into <UNK> fits when they want to touch her and the token fat <UNK> because after all what would an <UNK> sex comedy be without a fat <UNK> well this one has two this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of <UNK> sex comedies and then came the sequel thus <UNK> said proverbial barrel br br my grade d br br eye candy too numerous to count you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point think <UNK> party but not as funny and very disturbing br br where i saw it <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this show has a great storyline it's very believable a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show such as <UNK> <UNK> the lovable yet strong dog <UNK> <UNK> and alex who you can find out for yourself i don't want to spoil it for you and of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the sidekick of dj but the kids are wonderful too this is mary kate and ashley first took off and also you may know <UNK> cameron <UNK> from shows like st <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and that's so <UNK> jodie <UNK> plays <UNK> the love able middle child who feels left out really this is a very good show
<START> a terrible movie as everyone has said what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott <UNK> giving an award to one of the murdered <UNK> in front of a wall of sun <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> of sun <UNK> a company that practically <UNK> itself by its hatred of <UNK> they have been <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> complaints against <UNK> so were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that fire br br there's no public record i see of <UNK> involvement but clearly the makers of this movie know scott <UNK> an interesting mystery
<START> the movie only enter the cinema in <UNK> this year 2007 two years after it's official release and after many illegal dvd's had found its way to the public apparently the popularity of the illegal dvd's lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watch br br the movie is a great epic bringing japanese culture into your house in an <UNK> way in a sometimes <UNK> way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular <UNK> theater plays is something he finds boring br br at first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new <UNK> theater piece br br the audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in japanese traditions and mythology but that doesn't matter br br the way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the roller coaster of japanese cinema as well as theater br br let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home br br one critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that i think they should have chosen some more dramatic music but maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well
<START> but i expected better from caroline <UNK> she's done some good films and i was hoping this would be just as good as a matter of fact she and this other blonde girl character the girl who got <UNK> i think were the only two out of the 8 11 actors who could act this film has the worst acting i've ever seen almost as bad as <UNK> 1998 the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty <UNK> it to pour <UNK> acid in there she starts screaming and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world she attempts to get out but accidentally falls back in i will admit the violence and story is good along with harry <UNK> music but the acting could've been a lot better there were two other characters frank and joe i don't know about you but they bare a strange resemblance to dan <UNK> also when they find that woman's fried corpse in the <UNK> you would think they'd be screaming and <UNK> no caroline <UNK> and the blonde woman are the only ones who react frank and joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust i don't know about you but i know that if i saw a fried <UNK> of one of my best friends i'd <UNK> also when joe starts saying stuff like what happened to marty was an accident it wasn't our fault he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions then the blonde girl starts crying and says i'm scared frank and she grabs joe i guess the actress really didn't know which guy was which the film's ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw more confusing than the climax of jaws the revenge all the eight friends end up dead marty kills them all but then you see something that looks like him being chased by their <UNK> corpses and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident and then when the film ends marty dresses up as a nurse trying to <UNK> him but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or <UNK> like that kills a doctor and the film ends with marty <UNK> skin off his face which leads me to this next question what was the writer on when he came up with that did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened the ending left me so confused were the characters still alive is marty still holding a grudge did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all i don't know overall this movie was pretty dumb the acting sucked the music was okay the story was pretty decent except for the ending basically this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks see it only for harry <UNK> and caroline <UNK> 2 10 br br p s simon <UNK> marty committed suicide shortly after the film's release from intentional drug abuse i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was a pile of sh
<START> look it's eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend it's <UNK> from desperate <UNK> and the guy who wore sex <UNK> <UNK> in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to <UNK> how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell he's as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i
<START> a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an <UNK> who has a long term girlfriend of course the <UNK> is very good looking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre <UNK> character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it's tragic and you know she's going to end up very hurt but there's nothing you can do <UNK> is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants br br the scene two hours in when <UNK> and <UNK> have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very <UNK> and <UNK> sings along to <UNK> her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that <UNK> back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come br br it's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
<START> american pie has gone a long distance from the first at first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts story sets out as two <UNK> college guys featuring the young <UNK> setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties sex and of course the booze the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie in fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film br br luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking i'm a teen myself and i believe even <UNK> almighty would've been a better choice instead
<START> actually this is a lie shrek 3 d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didn't bug's life also do that i think it was at <UNK> in that tree so i'm saying before they go and use that as there <UNK> also shrek 3d was a motion <UNK> at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little <UNK> were i liked iq i agree with <UNK> they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure i recommend it to families and kids
<START> where the sidewalk ends 1950 br br where one ends another begins br br this is a <UNK> film noir and as such pretty flawless from both style and content points of view the photography and night settings are first rate cinematographer joseph <UNK> lets the drama <UNK> in scene after scene and the close ups on faces pure <UNK> i can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks br br but the acting is first rate here and the plot features what i consider the core of most noir films the <UNK> male lead representing the many men returning home to a changed united states after the war and feeling lost themselves in fact not only is dana andrews really convincing as the troubled loner detective he has a small but important counterpart in the film the lead <UNK> first husband an <UNK> ex <UNK> fallen onto hard times and booze the fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance overall the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the <UNK> wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head the woman transitions from one to the other we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact we can still see the path of one man with some psychological <UNK> <UNK> through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with it br br this movie belongs to andrews he plays a far more restrained and moving type than kirk douglas plays in a similar role in william <UNK> detective story made just one year later and andrews certainly is less theatrical you could easily see both movies side by side for a <UNK> compare and contrast session the fact that andrews as detective dixon is morally struggling through it all and douglas as detective <UNK> is not might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesn't gene tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic <UNK> and ultimately conventional and pretty type of woman not just a cardboard <UNK> but someone you want dixon to actually marry br br the criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama but is effective enough in its play with types and clichés the bit parts are kept snappy the small details like the <UNK> <UNK> table nice touches far from the character actors or the <UNK> of gambling in casablanca but then <UNK> great movie is iconic even in the details it makes no effort to be subtle and real and <UNK> but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring they come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men bogart is beginning his active duty dixon and the man dixon has killed are all through through thoroughly but not washed up br br it's no accident that many possibly most film <UNK> have what you would call happy endings the man <UNK> his <UNK> and transforms his inner self and the <UNK> then and now understands just how beautiful that must feel
<START> first off i had my doubts just looking at the dvd box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably even as a slasher movie except for the first friday the 13th br br i wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times but i just kept thinking that it had to get a little better it didn't usually i think every movie has something that you can take from it this has nothing br br do yourself a favor and find something <UNK> to do for 80 minutes like give yourself <UNK> or eat dirt
<START> this started bad got worse and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the dvd to the person we borrowed it off and choke the c t to death with it avoid this film a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen jenna jameson naked a million times if anyone feels the need to watch this film i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately as an example i would say trying to <UNK> a <UNK> house into your bum with no <UNK> would be a good start i hear that this film was not the original version i would very much like to view the original as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot and apparently most of the nudity can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with christian <UNK> he owes me an hour of my life back
<START> overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch with plenty of laugh out loud moments br br but this movie is not for everyone that is why i created this quick question <UNK> if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick br br 1 do you enjoy crude sexual humor 2 do you enjoy alcohol related humor 2 do you enjoy amazingly hot girls 3 do you enjoy viewing boobs 4 do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs 5 did i mention all the nice <UNK> in this film br br if you noticed the spoiler alert that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie i myself have no idea what the plot was about not that it matters
<START> i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this <UNK> really doesn't have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the season br br the acting was good i don't know how he <UNK> it but we've got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full <UNK> mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the series br br i especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br really good effort like i've said in other reviews these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
<START> really i liked it the premise was good the story fit where both respective series left off and here's my favorite part mary and valerie aren't bitter they aren't like others who become <UNK> with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible <UNK> a prime example is susan <UNK> the <UNK> family in fact valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie and then mary said the same thing later so i would be on the look for another but if that doesn't quite work out then they can re run this one
<START> i just got through watching this dvd at home we love westerns so my husband rented it he started <UNK> to me half way through the <UNK> costumes accents everything was off the part that made me so mad is where the guy didn't shoot the collector with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul his only excuse was he only had 2 <UNK> left we watched it all the way through and as someone else said too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked i mean the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found what's the point of that and why were there a grave yard where everyone died on april 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around if you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers this may be your movie however if you want a real western you will hate this movie
<START> this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you can't the writing is so obvious and <UNK> it's sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so <UNK> it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this br br that said it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this <UNK> goes but that's only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this we'd be disgusted br br so it gets 2 stars for being at least <UNK> <UNK> bad and the incidental music as opposed to the trying too hard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby doo but not as good
<START> very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley <UNK> who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading man br br pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters but without a realistic backdrop such characters are pointless br br nothing to see here keep moving br br
<START> very light spoilers maybe br br normally a fan of diane keaton i tried to watch this tonight i had to switch it off before the second hour because i found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother both came across as self absorbed with little regard for others with the daughter also adding in rude <UNK> and reckless to the mix when the daughter died the only thing i thought was at least we won't have to watch her anymore keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the <UNK> but it was too far gone for me by then i simply wasn't enjoying it so i stopped watching if you want me to care for the protagonist you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner if it's nearly an hour in and i don't care it's too late br br the supporting cast was sincere and well played i felt for them and the gay best friend was wonderful but even combined that wasn't enough to carry the film for me
<START> alone in the dark is one of my favorite role playing games of all time i remember spending whole nights facing the pc screen trying to escape that mansion and actually being <UNK> at times when monsters came surprisingly <UNK> in now mind you i am weary of computer game generated movies i don't remember a single success story in this new hollywood genre although some are entertaining enough to be watchable and yet i am such a big fan of the game that i couldn't resist my <UNK> was that if the movie had a plot that so much as <UNK> the <UNK> it would be ok br br man those were 90 minutes which seemed like 300 of my life that i'll never get back if i had that chance i would have gladly spent them <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> instead this isn't even in the so bad it's funny category you would think even christian slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb now tara reid i'm not complaining about her presence however if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene which i totally understand and support hey i'm a guy i've seen more of her body on press <UNK> br br there is no plot to speak of won't waste your time <UNK> it to you the credibility of the story sinks below 'i did not have sex with ms <UNK> the acting is but a few <UNK> above <UNK> <UNK> which by the way being one of the worst movies i've seen i would recommend over this one br br kids i recommend the video game it has far better story acting and much more thrills as for the movie here's a spoiler it stinks wait for the porno version
<START> this <UNK> horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic much much better than 90 of the scream rip offs out there i even hope they come up with a sequel
<START> i thought this was a very clunky <UNK> version of a famous australian story heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some personality but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical br br the beginning could have been a lot more involving perhaps starting with a shootout and then flashing back for a <UNK> of how they got there or that sort of thing and i felt like every scene was <UNK> predictable and <UNK> like a very bad tv soap br br i was really looking forward to this movie and hoping for something a lot better the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version but not by much
<START> it has been said that deanna durbin invented <UNK> this first film was one of the best the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna a little beauty with a gorgeous voice as the miss <UNK> in a family split by divorce for plot summary see other imdb entries but quickly deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to america from switzerland to prevent their father from <UNK> with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and <UNK> grey as the sisters good direction and editing the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings of <UNK> three songs only <UNK> <UNK> is from the classical <UNK> but when she sings it in that police station scene the film's place in history is assured at least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music one of the many nice touches that occur throughout three smart girls is the brief glimpse of the drunk <UNK> his neck for a final glimpse of deanna as the cops <UNK> him by one unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for durbin vehicles became locked into the miss <UNK> theme which quickly became stale deanna herself never did her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma which she certainly had it seems to me that like many another film personality she <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> ability that she lacked the <UNK> worked well for 21 feature films
<START> i could not for the life of me follow figure out or understand the story as the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible i'm going to guess and say that there was a <UNK> story plot problem that never got <UNK> out the producers could never separate the many details that the novel or any novel has the time and space to create from the other idea which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer's pursuit by the police they ended up with too many things happening in a <UNK> feature film time limit too bad really because they had a solid cast a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography in fact a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours
<START> this is one of those film's pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps but isn't necessary what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this isn't something so far away in the future this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released <UNK> the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced quite talented actors eric <UNK> is superb as the father who will do anything to be re united w his daughter however real or not she is he'll do it no matter the cost paula <UNK> of <UNK> fame is terrific as his wife as well you are not sure completely of his motives whether it's love or money or both but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing i see a star in the making of <UNK> played by the relative unknown <UNK> <UNK> her performance <UNK> <UNK> is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral <UNK> i didn't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story it's great to see <UNK> as a child already being affected influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to <UNK> life at this stage i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the <UNK> <UNK> robots this is an almost perfect pilot i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen if you haven't gotten into bsg least try this i'll bet you become a fan will want to see how the bsg story came to be
<START> dracula ii <UNK> is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of dracula when a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students 30 million to <UNK> the body and steal its blood for <UNK> it's an offer they can hardly refuse soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the <UNK> dracula ii <UNK> is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws the characters are one dimensional and the acting is pretty average there are some good gore effects like really cool double <UNK> scene but there is not enough violence for my liking the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense so if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look i prefer atmospheric vampire <UNK> from 60's and early 70's like lips of blood the brides of dracula or <UNK> a child's tale of supernatural to name only a few 4 out of 10
<START> i didn't expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget <UNK> for any <UNK> movie starring antonio <UNK> jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a good bad film br br every scene was by <UNK> as if someone had cut and <UNK> scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business <UNK> into the script <UNK> back and said my work is done it's all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously even when the plot developments are laughable br br do yourself a favor watch the x files if you're in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that
<START> a short review but br br avoid at all costs a <UNK> waste of <UNK> at the end of the film i was none the <UNK> as to what had actually happened it's full of cameos stephen <UNK> <UNK> jack dee 30 <UNK> the philadelphia girls and some vaguely <UNK> people but it just doesn't make any sense whether the story just got lost in the edit i don't now but <UNK> br br put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest br br 2 out of 10 for the cameos and a morris minor car chase br br
<START> endearing tale voted ten against all <UNK> for my age and sex not all that much comedy compared to a i almost wet myself movie although funny enough not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me but they do give you time to grab a drink or <UNK> without missing anything important maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally <UNK> no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling reminding you of what romance could and should be like something to shoot for my summary describes it best in very few words quite charming
<START> visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui <UNK> the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced the special effects are beautiful and imaginative the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons if thinking is not your <UNK> however this may not be your movie maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood <UNK> no brain club but if you are looking for something more he's where you will find it
<START> oh dear yet another example of <UNK> and religion no doubt we'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some hunky and macho freedom fighters from the ira well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock what a superb movie br br the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean <UNK> and sheila kelly in the 1950s there is a slight problem since they're getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a <UNK> but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a <UNK> that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they're old enough the story which is set in the 1950s then jumps forward a few years when the <UNK> daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they'll be attending the local <UNK> school much to the disgust of local priest father <UNK> from there things <UNK> br br let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish <UNK> <UNK> i was brought up as <UNK> and have considered myself as an <UNK> throughout my adult life in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a <UNK> and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people a love divided shows what happens when self <UNK> moral <UNK> take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe may i have the <UNK> to state that if karl marx saw this movie he'd love it and call it a masterpiece perhaps i shouldn't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you br br in <UNK> to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i don't claim to know the exact details of what happened in county <UNK> and there's no denying that father <UNK> and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila isn't <UNK> herself think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a <UNK> to bring her children up as <UNK> then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this this is a warning against taking <UNK> and not keeping to them not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their <UNK> lives there's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy <UNK> who is shown as being <UNK> not because he was a former ira member that makes a change we're not talking about the devil's own here but simply because he is an <UNK> who has decided to think for himself br br a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself all of which i agree with if there's any sort of criticism it's that it feels too much like a <UNK> rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the <UNK> of the masses
<START> i feel much less generous with this film than others of its <UNK> the portrayal of <UNK> in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally <UNK> everyone is <UNK> or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with <UNK> they are on the make or beating each other up it's as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the <UNK> nest where the <UNK> are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didn't see any of these guys these are too smart and <UNK> to make them come to life
<START> i don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie <UNK> i didn't know whether to turn off the set or file a <UNK> with o j 's attorney for <UNK> damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the <UNK> was <UNK> i am thankful i didn't have to pay for this <UNK> experience
<START> panic delivers the goods ten <UNK> with oscar caliber performances from william h macy <UNK> campbell and donald sutherland in a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with <UNK> honest and thought provoking panic is easily one of the best film to come out of hollywood in years the impact stays with you right after you leave the theater
<START> a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon <UNK> to give him <UNK> to use his songs of course they rejected
<START> claire <UNK> <UNK> is a beautiful but frustrating film the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in <UNK> giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction however the development of these characters is often <UNK> <UNK> for example a central theme in the story is young <UNK> inability to form strong relationships with others although this portrayal is executed <UNK> notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from <UNK> return to her childhood home the girl's lack of <UNK> with the film's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to <UNK> much interest in her development or lack thereof as a protagonist the general <UNK> of the film's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot the film raises a great deal of tension between characters particularly between <UNK> and the men in her life but never fully <UNK> this social <UNK> leaving the viewer <UNK> the final few scenes are powerful but depressing <UNK> work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama <UNK> is definitely not the best choice
<START> i saw this important intense film tonight its richard gere and <UNK> <UNK> most important and best work gere deserves an oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced into early retirement as a sex <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> claire danes is riveting as the woman gere <UNK> to replace him a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating one final case in which <UNK> character is convinced one of those he is charged to <UNK> may be holding a young girl hostage the subject matter is shocking sex <UNK> and those who <UNK> them but this film will not soon be forgotten i know i will be haunted by <UNK> portrayal for a very long time not since anthony hopkins portrayal of a serial killer has a screen portrayal terrified and so engaged me the film opens with a shocking <UNK> so don't miss the opening credits intense and memorable richard <UNK> finest role proving the man can act danes can as well and both do extraordinarily well in this often challenging film br br this is a <UNK> film and gere gives a multi layered deeply felt performance just give him the oscar now he deserves it
<START> <UNK> episode justice is the best episode of <UNK> it's my favorite episode of <UNK>
<START> i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of <UNK> fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in <UNK> heights 40 or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the <UNK> he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end <UNK> the means <UNK> had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when <UNK> with adults he would do this sort of thing again without <UNK> lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do br br some people think his victim was a nazi but i don't think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him br br one interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that <UNK> lucas is a german while the anti german <UNK> of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were <UNK> similar to what happened in california with people of japanese <UNK> it was something of an act of bravery for <UNK> to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet <UNK> after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no <UNK> about killing innocent civilians i think however that the <UNK> bombing and <UNK> happened later after watch on the <UNK> was released br br the title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am <UNK> was a german army <UNK> song used in wwii but the nazis had their own <UNK> song that was used as well but <UNK> is a german and he is engaged in his own <UNK> am <UNK> br br all the other actors did an excellent job here although <UNK> was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his father's secret away in real life he may very well have done so
<START> this is the first must see film i've seen in the last year it's <UNK> funny incredibly original unbelievably great looking they went for this super cool wide screen technicolor look that's awesome to behold and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society it's really smart satire that nails everything from <UNK> security to race issues while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her she's sweet funny and sexy billy connolly is great as fido who can only <UNK> and <UNK> and dylan baker as the dad is priceless in fact the whole cast is perfect henry <UNK> as the bad guy tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend getting the idea now funny though provoking and just all round amazing go and see this movie it's like nothing you've ever seen before
<START> flame in flame out that seems to be <UNK> in a nutshell a <UNK> creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon i'm not a fan of japanese monster films but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film dvd sci fi collection put out by mill creek <UNK> films it's a great value at about twenty five bucks so at fifty cents per movie it really <UNK> down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings br br <UNK> is <UNK> from a centuries long <UNK> by a nuclear blast and he's not happy like godzilla he takes it out on tokyo setting the united nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet they arrive at <UNK> <UNK> the hope of the world and wouldn't you know it there's a scene where a huge shed is shown that's called the <UNK> <UNK> building that was a nice touch br br by the mid 1960's this country still wasn't quite politically correct one of the american military scenes at the <UNK> air defense <UNK> has general arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee i guess there weren't any <UNK> around br br good old <UNK> was quite the sight though walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged that's why it surprised me how plan z managed to capture turtle man in the nose <UNK> of a hidden space ship <UNK> him off to mars to save the world high <UNK> all around for the american and russian team that made the save now let's get back to the cold war br br like godzilla <UNK> <UNK> at least a good dozen films but having seen this one pretty much <UNK> my interest in flying <UNK> <UNK> especially since that dvd pack i mentioned earlier has attack of the monsters with a featured guest appearance by the big g it took all i had to make it through to the end of both films it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said <UNK> <UNK>
<START> considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while it's always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldn't turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in there's something about mary here it looks like he's just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet br br watch 50 first dates instead
<START> entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern <UNK> version of it's a wonderful life michael caine plays a sort of angel who lets <UNK> see what life would have been like if he had made it big jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton not an oscar <UNK> but good warm hearted fun
<START> the only good thing about people i know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in the first big turn off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot the supporting cast did an extremely <UNK> job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour i still saw no signs of a <UNK> plot the story overall is a real bore and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake br br this movie will surely bore you as well avoid at all costs
<START> probably <UNK> <UNK> finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze <UNK> and <UNK> the delicious <UNK> may who spent most of tobe <UNK> <UNK> in the buff is the object of young <UNK> <UNK> pre teen lust he can't get <UNK> breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to <UNK> them and <UNK> the breasts of his own mother too his pursuit of may is the film as in <UNK> works such as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the director brings a slightly <UNK> sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale the usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will enjoy this <UNK> erotic poem to the female breast <UNK> luis <UNK> images are gorgeous and <UNK> <UNK> score is sweet and rich a gorgeous cinematic <UNK> with a delightfully <UNK> sensibility that the spanish do so naturally
<START> this film is terrible the story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister the film struggles with its identity <UNK> from noir thriller to erotic with elements of horror thrown in for good measure the film has a very confused structure for example with frequent use of flashbacks without <UNK> these into the story the plot is poorly developed and the characterisation made it difficult to <UNK> between who was who and the part they were playing some <UNK> exist in many films but the scene where the main protagonist willingly <UNK> a virtual stranger to his home then agrees to go upstairs alone to where he says she will find a phone minus the gun she had brought with her to call the police was too hard to believe some of the cinematography is very poor we were watching on a <UNK> tv so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me overall a chaotic mess
<START> well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher film br br long story short a bunch of teenagers young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get <UNK> down by naked <UNK> demons br br this movie has all the <UNK> for this slasher <UNK> br br naked women teens or young adults being <UNK> in <UNK> spooky gory death scenes the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her <UNK> but never <UNK> less a creepy crazy man who knows about the evil lesbian kiss scene sex being a killer no plot br br even then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head <UNK> or a nasty head cold br br give the demonic 0 10
<START> this early version of the tale 'the student of <UNK> was made in germany in <UNK> starring paul <UNK> who was also in 'the <UNK> a few years later in this film he plays a <UNK> role technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a <UNK> with him for gold the gold he needs to woo a <UNK> he's previously saved from drowning br br moving at a fast pace the film runs just over an hour and fairly well written and <UNK> 'the student of <UNK> has echoes of the <UNK> legend as well as dr <UNK> and mr hyde starting as it does with a <UNK> with a mysterious figure of potential evil and developing into good and evil sides of the same person
<START> the movie starts little cute there are a number of revolting scenes people in <UNK> good actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here this did not need to be crude br br forget it find the tv show disney at new low
<START> louise brooks gives a wonderful performance in this well made french melodrama she plays a <UNK> named <UNK> who despite being in love with a man named andre dreams of rising above her position in life she sees opportunity in a beauty contest for miss europe but andre is furious when he discovers that she's entered then demands that she <UNK> she tries to take back her entry only to discover that she's already been chosen as miss france and will now go on to the main <UNK> br br this is a story of love loss and decision played out to its passionate end the movie is very <UNK> filmed by director <UNK> <UNK> and cinema <UNK> <UNK> mate and louis <UNK> the filming style is more like modern movies than the hollywood flicks of the <UNK> and shows the different style employed by europeans there are many fast cuts and traveling shots mostly done with great skill and <UNK> the high energy of the movie's first third <UNK> a bit in the middle but picks up again in the last 15 minutes br br the performances were very good by all the principals but that of louise brooks is especially memorable louise <UNK> heavily on her silent screen skills even though this is a <UNK> but because her silent style had a surprisingly contemporary understated feel she makes the transition to <UNK> very well the long early scene at the fair was especially poignant as louise used her remarkably <UNK> eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation of being trapped in a life she no longer wants i doubt it's ever been done better br br the film builds to a superb finale <UNK> shot powerful and stylish this is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film and the tragic storyline only <UNK> the greater tragedy that this is the final starring role for louise brooks she wasn't just a great beauty who looked fantastic in a <UNK> she really was a major acting talent who basically threw it all away we are all the <UNK> for that br br this movie is less well known than her german films with g w <UNK> but i think it's a better one i think this crew is just better at storytelling than <UNK> and while <UNK> de <UNK> may lack the deep moral complexity of the <UNK> films it's much easier to follow and is overall a more <UNK> focused piece of work and it doesn't hurt that <UNK> singing parts are done by edith <UNK> either br br bottom line this is a classic louise brooks film well worth looking for
<START> first saw this movie in about 1990 and absolutely died laughing through it it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends and we'd quote from it at the drop of a hat i'm going home in a bag needless to say the humor is still there 15 years later it's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film good thing you can still buy it off ebay i've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek and this movie provides it all pathos suspense <UNK> love <UNK> and the list goes on royal <UNK> provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man <UNK> i remember seeing him in the 7 faces of dr <UNK> as a bad guy who met a bad end here you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning br br if you aren't careful you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie the creators got real subtle in many ways with <UNK> comments little subtle costume <UNK> at other sci fi movies and even a scene ripped from the pages of <UNK> e <UNK> br br don't spend too much thought <UNK> trying to analyze a movie people this is fun fare without the need for <UNK> and shouldn't be offensive to anyone well maybe stupid people but they won't know they're being <UNK> br br now if you'll excuse me i'm gonna go get a <UNK> <UNK> bar br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dj entertainer
<START> what an empty and lack <UNK> rendition of the classic novel i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different i felt that the ralph <UNK> version is much worse though as the casting of juliette <UNK> as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever anyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is <UNK> throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe the direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> does a great turn as <UNK> and is in fact one of <UNK> wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although a more talented director would have made better use of the <UNK> he had its clear that he was a director for hire and didn't <UNK> the project with the passion that it deserved
<START> this is another gem of a stand up show from eddie izzard you cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about he even takes the <UNK> out of his american <UNK> at times and most of them didnt even realise it a must see for anybody who likes comedians 9 out of 10
<START> surviving christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released ben affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that <UNK> his childhood home to be his family for christmas he then drives the family crazy with <UNK> for christmas cheer i have not been a ben affleck fan in the past though i did like <UNK> and paycheck but here he is well cast in this role i also like christina <UNK> as the daughter in the family who can't stand <UNK> character at first sure you can see where this movie is going but you don't care ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of christmas movies
<START> you all know the story of hamlet i do br br well the to be or not to be phrase not the speech itself has been beaten into the ground so many times that it's not very interesting in fact it wasn't that great to begin with in fact i find hamlet a good but vastly overrated play it's not even shakespeare's best <UNK> <UNK> and romeo juliet are ten times better with a <UNK> <UNK> dream and othello not too far behind <UNK> knock your table off his <UNK> <UNK> will make <UNK> <UNK> isn't that bad either there are lots of others that are better than this by shakespeare br br i won't really comment too much on the movie rather i will <UNK> the utterly horrible mst3k episode br br okay mike and the <UNK> win a card game get to pick the movie they ask for hamlet pearl sends them this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and prepare for the most boring sci fi episode of mst3k ever admittedly i haven't seen any of the <UNK> ones br br while blood waters of dr z makes the viewing of that episode horrible since it is not really a movie rather random spliced together scenes i'm reminded of <UNK> line from future war maybe this is an anthology of short <UNK> movies the <UNK> crew a lot got off a good many good cracks can't say the same for here br br the <UNK> fall flat the host segments par usual are at best mediocre and when the movie itself which isn't that bad is actually better i mean as a quality movie not as camp like prince of space than the mst3k version of it you know the show must be bad i laughed the last time i saw it was several months ago oh maybe eight or nine times throughout i tried and tried and tried to be entertained but i just couldn't only the occasional line like <UNK> queen <UNK> boss and when that's the funniest line of the episode well <UNK> and by occasional i mean every ten minutes or so maybe me even chuckle the second time i tried to watch it i didn't even laugh at the few jokes i'd found funny before and simply gave up forty minutes before br br the movie isn't horrible it's just a german version of hamlet the actors are good enough and though the dubbing isn't the greatest that's not in itself a reason to hate this film br br four stars for hamlet three yes three for the mst3k version br br ps why why why mst3k
<START> in a <UNK> of sholay ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape the <UNK> goes south <UNK> as <UNK> the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance <UNK> style the accent is totally south indian in contrast to <UNK> from the north the <UNK> of the hands of <UNK> by <UNK> is also cut down to the fingers in <UNK> so make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long <UNK> <UNK> covers up for the cut fingers <UNK> in the climax where the <UNK> uses his legs and says <UNK> <UNK> to mere <UNK> hi <UNK> <UNK> here <UNK> uses his finger <UNK> to fire a gun and kill the villain <UNK> the new <UNK> of <UNK> is also different he is not from <UNK> or up he is <UNK> <UNK> infamous laugh is also in two <UNK> this time and is more subdued <UNK> asks for <UNK> instead of <UNK> and romances <UNK> the replacement of helen in <UNK> he also dances and enjoys dancing with <UNK> who plays <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> is more intelligent this time he <UNK> the apple and asks the question that made <UNK> <UNK> discover laws of <UNK> <UNK> is more <UNK> than the auto driver <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cannot play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with gay abandon <UNK> was fun whereas ajay <UNK> is a <UNK> for the role the god speaks to <UNK> incident and the shooting lessons and the <UNK> <UNK> song and the water tank sequences are painful the water tank turns into a well and the drunk <UNK> is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide <UNK> was composed and serious <UNK> raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him but he also <UNK> on the <UNK> sequence he is not as romantic as <UNK> with the mouth <UNK> <UNK> role played by <UNK> changes careers a pure housewife turns into a doctor this time <UNK> into full time social service after her husband is killed she too lacks the pain that <UNK> displayed her <UNK> with <UNK> are more open this time <UNK> gets a bigger role this time as <UNK> he does not have to point guns and answer questions of <UNK> this time he follows <UNK> wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more <UNK> outside the <UNK> horses give way to <UNK> and auto the <UNK> <UNK> here keeps changing and <UNK> becomes <UNK> all in all it is more of a spoof than anything else <UNK> comes up with his own interpretation of the classic but we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues so we call it a spoof so mr <UNK> sholay and <UNK> <UNK> don and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stop making <UNK> and start making originals
<START> it's impossible for me to <UNK> consider this movie not that i haven't tried mind you but i sit down and i pop in the aged vhs and i watch the opening and suddenly i'm five years old again and <UNK> my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart br br i can see <UNK> that this movie is a bizarre combination of <UNK> baby <UNK> <UNK> and creepy <UNK> children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation but my inner five year old goes <UNK> care bears every time i think about it so i'd only <UNK> reluctantly recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it like me or those <UNK> cynical gen x y <UNK> who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad strange a category in which this movie definitely belongs to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment you might want to keep looking
<START> didn't <UNK> pizza win the oscar for that year this movie never had a chance due to the casting but perhaps by now people can see why i felt that way upon leaving the theater only <UNK> left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater with the feeling i was getting a glimpse of our future history has shown that this is exactly what happened br br the casting is a pop culture <UNK> of the 1980s you get arnold as ben richards the framed fugitive offered a chance to run for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie richard dawson as damon <UNK> treating his role as if he were the host of family <UNK> with the contestants using real guns jesse <UNK> as captain freedom and co wrestler professor <UNK> as <UNK> both <UNK> who kill the running men even mick <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> show up while the dancers of the future are none other than the <UNK> girls this movie screams 80s the plot is a good excuse for the action ben richards is determined to prove his innocence but agrees to be the running man when he is told that his buddies would be set free instead they join him as contestants maria <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> is the standard by which one can properly judge <UNK> <UNK> in the 1990s br br the production value on the film was a bit poor the lines were cheesy and at the time the plot seemed a bit far fetched i remember thinking when i was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast if the running man were listed in tv guide most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the <UNK> today the government influences on the media have only gotten worse and the <UNK> down american public of the future that <UNK> all of its <UNK> for national security is downright chilling ben richards is played brilliantly by arnold as one of the few remaining <UNK> against a government <UNK> that the rest of america is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some <UNK> gifts for the audience br br the movie was way over the top maybe even off the cliff for its time but as with back to the future iii the <UNK> it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond and this movie will <UNK> into the future as one of the more <UNK> films of our time it is tragic that as with <UNK> the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved serious actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more oscars but that doesn't make them better films than their common man counterparts such as this one br br an absolute must see
<START> i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday 13th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the <UNK> hair that kept <UNK> around the <UNK> and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty <UNK> looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by <UNK> george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester when not just plain old acting angry <UNK> york has the most dated 1970's <UNK> i have ever seen in a victorian movie the characters hardly speak to each other so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and <UNK> love is gone the ending is ludicrous br br please rent the timothy dalton version instead it is so true to the book it's like having the novel read <UNK> to you dalton is superb as rochester g c scott is laughable
<START> how good is gwyneth paltrow this is the right movie for her too bad she's completely out role i haven't read the book by jane austen but i can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures it wasn't probably that easy to <UNK> in 2 hours of show about <UNK> pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea <UNK> i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didn't <UNK> the mark of overacting a couple of times
<START> i can't believe i waste my time watching this garbage i did because leonard <UNK> gave it an <UNK> rating and for tv movies this is usually a reliable <UNK> of some quality entertainment br br the acting was ok but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication the plot is ludicrous the motivations of the bad guys totally absent and the various family interactions silly and shallow for example dad <UNK> that violent reaction to <UNK> is bad but he turns out to be an admirable person not because of his ignore the idiots philosophy but because he's pretty good with his <UNK> br br the only message i was able to <UNK> from this <UNK> was that the nuclear family is good and alternate living <UNK> are bad oh and bad people happen to good people
<START> i was deeply moved by this movie in many respects first of all i just want to say that clara <UNK> was the most precious little thing such a pretty little girl her acting was superb as well true to life and very human though i don't like the part where she had to smoke i hope it was only a fake prop either way she was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving i found myself immersed in the story and her character br br it's quite interesting how i came to discover this movie actually i was walking in blockbuster and i just happened to notice her pretty smile on the cover as i was walking by luckily i <UNK> in the <UNK> direction that this movie was in i thought to myself <UNK> look at her ' so i picked it up and saw that this movie was described as such wonderful things as a little gem i read the plot on the back and then thought that well maybe i'd look it up on imdb first and then come back and rent it at a later time i'm glad i didn't because i certainly would have been missing out after searching for a movie with my friend i knew that i would end up <UNK> not renting this film so i went back to the spot in which i originally found it and <UNK> it up br br it had been on my <UNK> for a week since school started for me this week and i really hadn't any time to watch it but tonight was the perfect opportunity i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography delightful score and moving plot from beginning to end i was so captivated and must say some parts nearly moved me to tears br br i would also like to make a special mention for the young boy in this film juan jose <UNK> he was remarkable also the actor who played <UNK> father who's name is unfortunately not listed on the site his voice was just so loving and gentle that i could really sense his love for carol even though his appearance is not prominent i really felt his character's presence br br this is truly a wonderful movie if you are a person who is moved by light but emotional films then this is definitely one for you
<START> i watched an episode yes i sat through the entire miserable experience and i have to say this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get imagine peter <UNK> of family guy fame now imagine peter <UNK> as a admittedly slim and minus the glasses woman except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious peter <UNK> is an idiot but he doesn't know he's an idiot sarah has none of the genuine character none of the acting ability to pull her character off maybe its the trite formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself maybe it's the lack of believable <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> persona may appeal to <UNK> <UNK> people unlike the mass appeal that stephen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character has like bill <UNK> sarah creates an annoying unfunny character she lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire let alone for the entire world of comedy what sarah silverman lacks its noticeable and when you don't believe it and identify with it it's not funny anymore
<START> the story and music george gershwin are wonderful as are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and of course kelly one <UNK> missing and that thing is a good leading lady i'm sorry leslie caron bothers me anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous and deservedly so ballet oh the colours the dazzling <UNK> blues <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> forget the <UNK> as well i just adore the contrast between the <UNK> arts ball completely black and white costumes and the ever so brilliant ballet br br so i suppose what i'm trying to say is this please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isn't the best it is marvelous but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was <UNK> to stardom just afterward
<START> the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in it is well made and very powerful the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the <UNK> <UNK> perspective i believe it give great insight into a sub culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it some parts were difficult to watch as most reality is but it is not over done its good the first time you watch it but it becomes even better the second or third time around because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge
<START> the writers and producers of this little outing have <UNK> new depths of <UNK> did writer's block set in so badly or had ideas <UNK> up so much that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman <UNK> in the back seat of a van and then promptly throws the <UNK> at the car behind mind you at least this <UNK> what this film is worth we had already been treated to one of the other women <UNK> over one of her friends at <UNK> as well as numerous episodes of graphic <UNK> once would have <UNK> we got the message this really is taking toilet humour to another level had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video this was a fairly original storyline with a clever the only piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van thus making it feel much more real we never got to see inside any other locations such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared and this could have added much needed tension br br the script was dire lines like 'i don't feel too good i want to go <UNK> after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath subjected to rape by a <UNK> and shot at seem a little <UNK> br br the acting was diabolical apart from the maniac did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a <UNK> course during a long <UNK> strike the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on br br the director seemed to have an easy job in this it seems that the only direction he must have given was <UNK> girls' br br and as for the screaming if you watch this please be sure to have some <UNK> at the ready
<START> the plot of this movie hangs on one important point that this murderer was also a responsible loving caring father not that being a father and a murderer is impossible but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without <UNK> or reason and without emotion this girl was someone's daughter i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold blooded to someone else's daughter or alternately could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his <UNK> parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief br br that said the characters were acted with conviction by the actors i thought changing scott <UNK> eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is you couldn't see into his eyes at all
<START> without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s <UNK> seems to really really want to be something important the tragic truth is that it's so entirely <UNK> on every level that one can't help but laugh reaching in desperation for the <UNK> elements of <UNK> <UNK> films it follows a city <UNK> day in the wilderness they walk along a shady path <UNK> <UNK> like a u c berkeley coffee <UNK> almost every line of <UNK> dialog delivered here is <UNK> bad i feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny <UNK> as this <UNK> but is it as beautiful after what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening well ok we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene there is finally a very <UNK> confrontation involving a pair <UNK> vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk <UNK> with an <UNK> guitar br br nothing at all <UNK> or interesting happens in this entire film i thought the larry <UNK> picture <UNK> need rain was a weak example of a bergman homage golden <UNK> is every bit as bad but the <UNK> random <UNK> it presents makes it <UNK> awful 1 10
<START> as a youth <UNK> i heard good things about this movie then i watched it the acting wasn't the best that's forgivable it's the message that's not give jesus your life and everything will change you'll tackle better make amazing catches stop <UNK> start making <UNK> passes and even make the <UNK> all because jesus magically turns horrible <UNK> <UNK> into all american <UNK> i laughed out loud when a coach <UNK> <UNK> to explain to the <UNK> why he was missing field goals but wait that's not all you'll get a brand new truck a <UNK> raise and you and your wife's struggle with <UNK> will suddenly end in <UNK> twice then you'll win the state championship because god helps a <UNK> kick the winning field goal 12 <UNK> further than he's ever kicked before and into the wind no less all because god wanted him to make it then you'll win the state championship again the next year none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts br br here's what i took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it and it's all about making our lives better easier and more enjoyable he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games which bible is this story based on i'll bet saint stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 <UNK> were killed for following jesus it would have saved them all a lot of trouble
<START> that '70s show is definitely the funniest show currently on tv i started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show i like all the characters but my personal favorites are <UNK> and <UNK> leo was also an awesome character while he was there i really hope he comes back because he's hilarious it's classic when <UNK> goes you son of a bitch and when <UNK> yells burn that always makes me laugh they are both great characters and always have something funny to say jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show she started out being really good looking but damn somewhere around season 5 6 she just got really hot i've seen most of the episodes more than once some like 10 times and there still hilarious this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it the cast is classic almost everyone is funny where with many shows there are only a few funny characters i will be sad to see this show end next year but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever
<START> this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best at the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die some scenes are shocking such as the <UNK> scene and others are not shocking like the girl being <UNK> 100 times because you see punches in nearly every movie this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older br br 9 10
<START> the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most <UNK> were stay at homes watching their new 7 <UNK> <UNK> almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to <UNK> <UNK> obviously today's 10 movies will dominate in 1951 it cost <UNK> to 1 60 at radio city <UNK> to <UNK> first run at <UNK> palace in washington <UNK> or <UNK> to <UNK> in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people <UNK> to the picture not <UNK> box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of <UNK> caruso really not a great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead 90 of the movie's focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer <UNK> caruso the result was a wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on <UNK> too fat to play the student prince edmund <UNK> took his place with <UNK> voice dubbed in and with the <UNK> handsome and not fat lanza <UNK> in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it's almost always on ebay for 2 00 or less don't be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy <UNK> of copies not the quality of the movie
<START> oh my bad clothing worse <UNK> music and the worst david <UNK> the 80's are back with vengeance in <UNK> an american italian co production <UNK> by infamous joe <UNK> on the production side and short <UNK> director thank heavens for small <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> directing <UNK> as a kind of sequel to sam <UNK> evil dead series in italy that was dubbed la <UNK> in there <UNK> delivers some modest gore <UNK> and bad acting br br a mix of ghost story <UNK> and witchcraft the film <UNK> clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it's progress to <UNK> ending topped with some serious wtf surprise climax i just love the look on her face surprisingly <UNK> manages to gather some suspense and air of <UNK> in few very few scenes <UNK> for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively br br the plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic <UNK> and red paint style of the 80's <UNK> gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow i could only watch with sadistic glee and few <UNK> all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got <UNK> and <UNK> one by one i only felt sorry for linda blair who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography br br well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror and speaking of hearts every movie that has david <UNK> getting <UNK> by a <UNK> metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors must have it's one on the right place br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> a wonderful early musical film from <UNK> <UNK> as fun and witty as his silent the italian straw hat using sound in a <UNK> way and not just for dialogue and effects <UNK> influenced early musicals in america the opera scene from a night at the opera is strongly influenced by le million for example should but won't be seen by all <UNK> and the dvd from <UNK> is exactly as good as you'd expect there's not a ton of extras but most dvd extras i've seen are useless fluff and the <UNK> interview on disc is one i hadn't ever seen get it while it's still around
<START> i just saw this movie mainly because brady <UNK> is in it and i must say that i was not pleased br br of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touch up also i think this movie would have done much better with more <UNK> and blood as well if it were rated pg 13 br br that would definitely attract more people to see it teens what would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of brady <UNK> on the thunderbirds poster br br even though the movie had it's down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
<START> we all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books while not particularly accurate adaptations these movies were nonetheless excellent films some great examples are the harry potter series the lord of the rings trilogy and to a lesser extent almost every disney film ever made however i must <UNK> <UNK> that a <UNK> in time is not one of those movies not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of madeleine <UNK> fan base it manages to defy the standards of <UNK> acting special effects and ultimately respect for the audience mind you i'm not trying to be mean on the contrary i went into this affair with an open mind i figured that a made for t v movie would make up for its lack of <UNK> <UNK> in its script after all the star wars spin off ewoks was decent if a little silly come to think of it the original star wars was made on a lunch money budget and look where it took george lucas however from the first scene <UNK> disappointment started <UNK> me as if i'd gotten too close to the black thing while <UNK> br br the same way <UNK> shooting first became the symbol of the star wars special edition of 1997 a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic mrs <UNK> has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is a <UNK> in time the reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting <UNK> <UNK> star trek first contact and radio as our favorite star turned mentor the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow that's right a crow moreover the heavenly <UNK> form of this greatly beloved character has been <UNK> at by what looks to be a demented eight year old the <UNK> half man half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle had i been five this would have psychologically traumatized me for life the worst part is the fact that when it spoke it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single <UNK> cheek thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than e t br br having gotten the most painful part out of the way i must go on to the tear inducing one the characters the acting and the story i personally had always imagined meg to look somewhat similar to <UNK> myrtle from the harry potter films plain hair glasses and a figure most <UNK> would find laughable she was always a slightly anxious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> in the film she is an unpleasant know it all for whom i have no sympathy whatsoever in fact she makes me feel sorry for poor mr <UNK> her school principal who continuously has to deal with her <UNK> the kind intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has <UNK> jock the irony is horrible as for the memorable happy medium they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is above gender and likes to look at funny things such as girls falling off of <UNK> the only three people i can think of who did a decent job are charles wallace mrs <UNK> and the man with red eyes <UNK> the dude with red eyes due to his complete <UNK> as a character br br the story is a mess a good comparison to this aspect of the movie is harry potter and the prisoner of <UNK> which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book yet kept the sole of the original work here the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with <UNK> down in the underworld apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed as the dark lord <UNK> the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen the flat <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> who replace the wondrous beings who hold aunt beast among their ranks tear the spine up as the god of the dead notes how subtle the terror of the earth like <UNK> was the torn pages are scattered in the <UNK> and lost in the darkness of the land of evil br br i am very sorry that this film exists i do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad it's the way the characters are written that ruins it a <UNK> in time deserved to be adapted by lawrence <UNK> directed by george lucas or steven spielberg enhanced at industrial light and magic scored by john williams given its sound at skywalker sound edited by <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> century fox in its current state the film is <UNK> to be shown to self <UNK> people even madeleine <UNK> thought it was bad the book was good the film was bad and mrs <UNK> was ugly br br score 0 1 10 if i could br br pros br br they got the names right br br cons br br it had horrible problems with the <UNK> notes level of adaptation script acting and special effects not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book oh and the main cover poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle some might say that this <UNK> high adventure i say it <UNK> the <UNK> of the cover artist who didn't even bother to <UNK> <UNK> arm on properly
<START> it could have been a marvelous story based on the ancient races of cat people but it wasn't br br this work could have been just that marvelous and <UNK> with <UNK> references which kept my fascination <UNK> the lead characters charles brady played by brian <UNK> and his mother mary played by alice <UNK> were <UNK> done had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing not even <UNK> <UNK> who played <UNK> robertson 's character fit into that description br br however as i've said many times before when you adapt a stephen king novel for tv you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for tv and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he <UNK> as a novelist br br this is another <UNK> attempt to take the <UNK> of stephen king writing whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay to simply cut and <UNK> his work onto the small screen his novels get completely <UNK> in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie nothing less but certainly nothing more his screenplays are hit and miss unfortunately this screenplay translation was a miss br br sorry sorry sorry movie br br this movie gets a 1 0 10 from br br the fiend
<START> rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions which could have kept away many film goers looking for a <UNK> similar plot fortunately von <UNK> a good screenwriter <UNK> for a feminist <UNK> to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior but too little <UNK> in terms of <UNK> and from the point of view of ordinary <UNK> german rather from a jewish standpoint <UNK> finds its strength in these <UNK> <UNK> of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims the pace of the film is <UNK> <UNK> slow <UNK> besides the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been <UNK> crafted rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece and some narrative flaws are well <UNK> another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters nevertheless this film is worth seeing finally rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa and recently the controversial downfall i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images
<START> a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy <UNK> who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight seeing her 3 month old baby being brutally taken from their family's <UNK> while camping on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does <UNK> justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate <UNK> on this <UNK> case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired
<START> there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese <UNK> that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed robert <UNK> has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best
<START> if you ever have the chance to see sandra <UNK> live in person you better move on it <UNK> i saw her last year in los angeles at the opening of her everything bad and beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show she is now in new york with the show and it <UNK> with the release of her groundbreaking <UNK> without you i'm nothing we have lost richard <UNK> <UNK> bruce nina <UNK> but sandra is still with us <UNK> smith is missing in action but not sandra barbara streisand continues to <UNK> her head out once in awhile but sandra more than makes up for where <UNK> leaves off okay i want it known ms <UNK> is a little of these influential <UNK> and more i really wanted to push this film because of its truth honesty humor <UNK> songs ranging from laura <UNK> <UNK> nina <UNK> prince and a script that <UNK> the <UNK> joy sadness ups and downs of the 70's and 80's it is my opinion that many and i mean many comics have lifted okay outright stolen so much from this show if not from sandra herself i won't name names but come on people you and i know who they are see the thing is <UNK> plays by her own rules this movie shows as does her live performances that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business as well as pushing forward her performances are reminiscent of <UNK> jazz <UNK> during the time of miles davis <UNK> monk 70's tv shows intimate <UNK> acts and <UNK> that are reminiscent of everyone from judy garland to joan <UNK> most comedians couldn't even touch where sandra is coming from or going to so here i was a year ago watching sandra at the silent movie theater in total awe and joy i wanted to meet her after the show give her something that meant something to me that hopefully would mean something to her but i listen to my copy of giving <UNK> it hurts and just thank her in a <UNK> of sorts for making me laugh making me think making me feel you can't deny this <UNK> presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage she's still here damn it even after the release of without you i'm nothing some 15 years ago and she looks great by the way i know this <UNK> walking from the theater one audience member said to another she is so funny and she still looks incredible if you can't experience her live yet please see this movie as for me i do hope that sandra will see this you've meant a heck of a lot to me gotten me through some tough crazy times if you can send me an email please do if not knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so is enough for me come on people give it up for the lady
<START> i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 it is the worst thing i've ever seen so bad in fact that by sheer <UNK> this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed br br whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten i mean really the devil vs santa visions of hell creepy laughing wind up <UNK> forced child labor with racial stereotypes it ain't <UNK> street that's for sure as crow <UNK> during the mst3k showing this is good ol' fashioned nightmare fuel br br there's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up <UNK> <UNK> presumably the <UNK> <UNK> hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds i e heaven santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to mr <UNK> for children who ask for siblings there are symbols around the castle that either look like <UNK> or <UNK> stars br br my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us
<START> this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing the film doesn't seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and <UNK> route i never saw the first film but this one doesn't stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
<START> anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by american international pictures a <UNK> that <UNK> 1980s giant cannon films wherever movie goers <UNK> <UNK> would be right there to supply the latest en <UNK> titles in the 50s came horror movies like <UNK> <UNK> and 'the undead ' in the 60s were frankie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beach comedies and biker flicks like 'the glory <UNK> ' and into the 70s <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> level trash like <UNK> girls' and <UNK> hill ' br br <UNK> ' released in 1973 is one of the more <UNK> <UNK> efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the <UNK> <UNK> for entertainment <UNK> and common sense be damned on the whole <UNK> is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact <UNK> was a fair effort by screenwriter director john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career br br the <UNK> minute <UNK> epic for <UNK> scope follows the quest of fbi <UNK> chief <UNK> <UNK> played by academy award winner ben johnson <UNK> was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city <UNK> that helped gangster frank <UNK> to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that <UNK> including expert <UNK> john dillinger warren <UNK> pretty boy <UNK> steve <UNK> and psychopath baby face nelson richard dreyfuss dillinger eventually joined forces with <UNK> and nelson taking along homer van <UNK> harry dean <UNK> and harry <UNK> geoffrey lewis he also hooked up with <UNK> <UNK> michelle phillips a prostitute of french and indian <UNK> while taking place over several months in 1933 4 <UNK> is basically a chase film with <UNK> <UNK> looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover br br <UNK> has a documentary feel listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as <UNK> <UNK> keeps an honest depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also <UNK> around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster <UNK> the film is never boring moving at a quick if <UNK> pace the action scenes are <UNK> <UNK> edited competently by fred <UNK> jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank <UNK> rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of <UNK> this film is certainly not for the <UNK> with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life br br this film never <UNK> its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn't there john <UNK> somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes mostly blood filled <UNK> are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including <UNK> <UNK> and clyde ' but we simply don't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and <UNK> is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and <UNK> as lovers just ten minutes afterward <UNK> <UNK> also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when <UNK> needs to keep the film from <UNK> all too often the film takes on a shoot 'em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail br br aside from this the <UNK> main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that <UNK> is just a film it's films such as this one that create <UNK> and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as <UNK> screenplay and the film's documentary style encourage us to believe in fact dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van <UNK> he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> while these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why <UNK> couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them br br warren <UNK> performance as dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing <UNK> is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however we never really feel the menace he <UNK> in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to <UNK> suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the <UNK> <UNK> character and it's really too bad that <UNK> screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with <UNK> dreyfuss <UNK> lewis and a briefly appearing <UNK> <UNK> are acceptable for such talent br br as a piece of 1970s exploitation <UNK> appears doomed to <UNK> bargain <UNK> which is exactly where i picked up <UNK> dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in french and spanish <UNK> theatrical trailer is <UNK> as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in <UNK> the film doesn't really call for much else in way of <UNK> material for fans of the genre it's certainly worth checking out br br out of 4 br br <UNK> reviewer www <UNK> com paul <UNK>
<START> man some of you people have got to chill this movie was artistic genius instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction a story entertainment for god's sake no pun intended it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie critics and they're not doing to well i'm so impressed by the movie and bill <UNK> job at directing that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film me and all of my friends did
<START> visually <UNK> plot less incredibly mind numbing rubbish not even close to <UNK> better work avoid at all costs br br the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> effects do nothing more than confuse the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the <UNK> <UNK> of images is pretentious in the extreme br br there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film even the nudity is incredibly <UNK> which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring br br plus how anyone can say that the acting of <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant is beyond me he showed more ability in the star wars series and that's saying something br br i've not been so <UNK> with a film since i saw <UNK> <UNK> and the little <UNK>
<START> you don't need to read this review br br an earlier review by <UNK> of seattle has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production i can only <UNK> its basic arguments br br bleak house was a relatively late dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work this is taken too literally by the director ross <UNK> who <UNK> on the <UNK> and fog too much when <UNK> rick and esther appear half an hour into the opening episode it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time in some of the <UNK> scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my tv screen i watched the whole thing in one day starting in mid afternoon as daylight faded this became less of an issue but i have a pretty good tv and i have never encountered this problem before at any time of day br br the pacing is very deliberate i e slow i am sure this was <UNK> but it is overdone there are numerous shots of people <UNK> though the <UNK> and <UNK> of victorian london that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere a good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty minute episode without losing a line of dialogue just by <UNK> each of these scenes slightly br br i don't want to <UNK> these two problems you soon <UNK> to the look and pace of this production the more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story very effectively earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house but are not nearly so <UNK> plotted for example i recently re read nicholas <UNK> because i was intrigued to see how douglas <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> page book into his two hour movie the answer is simple the book is full of padding <UNK> cut great <UNK> of the novel while still <UNK> all the essential story elements this would not be possible with bleak house br br this production needs its seven hours probably it needs even longer because many elements of its convoluted plot are not <UNK> clear or as well handled as they need to be a few random examples will illustrate the problems br br the maid <UNK> appears from nowhere with no background so lady <UNK> <UNK> to her is largely <UNK> br br sergeant <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> demand for a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> is somewhat <UNK> br br it is not made clear enough that esther is actually in love with <UNK> when she agrees to marry john <UNK> neither is it clear that they have agreed not to <UNK> their engagement or why br br <UNK> and <UNK> secret marriage is <UNK> in one episode they are merely lovers in the next people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife br br mrs <UNK> is only introduced at a late stage in the story and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from his family is left unexplained as is the means by which she is discovered br br <UNK> dedication to maintaining the honour and <UNK> of the <UNK> family is understated so his motive for <UNK> lady <UNK> is more obscure than it need be br br the involvement of the brick makers with both tom and later lady <UNK> is somewhat <UNK> br br it is not obvious that <UNK> <UNK> his offer to esther because her <UNK> <UNK> have all but <UNK> br br this is only a selection there are others they are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough nonetheless they are minor <UNK> that detract from its power you shouldn't have to puzzle over little plot points however there are more important <UNK> problems that do <UNK> the story in its later stages br br the whole business of <UNK> murder is somewhat thrown away bucket immediately <UNK> <UNK> as a suspect which <UNK> the suspense of sergeant <UNK> <UNK> and the importance of finding mrs <UNK> it also <UNK> the impact of the sub plot in which suspicion is thrown on lady <UNK> and <UNK> the scene in which <UNK> is <UNK> in front of sir lester br br a more serious problem is that the murder its investigation and the subsequent search for lady <UNK> dominate the story for over an hour during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot <UNK> the legal case and its effect on rick his failing <UNK> his <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> despair his <UNK> health and so on are all put on hold for an entire episode this may be how dickens wrote the book i haven't read it for years but a good screenplay should keep the different plot <UNK> moving forward together br br finally <UNK> role in the story is so <UNK> that he is almost superfluous his discovery of the new will that <UNK> the final phase of the story is also thrown away it happens off screen br br despite all of this it is still a very good production many of the performances are outstanding individual scenes are beautifully realised its <UNK> sense of tragedy is very powerful i would still be <UNK> it as a superb adaptation of a great book had it not been for the 2005 production in fact i probably wouldn't be fully aware of its <UNK> if i hadn't seen how andrew davies did it better i have been critical of <UNK> jane austen adaptations but i have to admit that he really knows how to tame <UNK> <UNK> books br br this is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of <UNK> time nonetheless its <UNK> fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross reference to the near definitive 2005 version
<START> how can this movie have a 5 5 this movie was a piece of <UNK> s t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he <UNK> his head into the wooden <UNK> that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw it second the person who did the set sucks as at <UNK> things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t v show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s t they call a movie br br rating 0 3
<START> after viewing the film i was truly shocked to see such a high rating on imdb br br 'the fantastic mr <UNK> is an adaption of a beloved children's classic portraying the story of the smooth slick protagonist mr fox or <UNK> as he attempts one <UNK> heist to steal from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bean that's right one short one fat one lean or however it goes br br i don't quite know where to start with my criticism br br well i'm in my late teens and was never a fan of <UNK> <UNK> but i like his material well enough having read a few of his books as a child and seen <UNK> and charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again this film however struggles for an audience is it aimed at children adults i'm still unsure many of the <UNK> would bore a child especially as mr fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor also an audience of i'm assuming children is expected to <UNK> with a character who steals and kills <UNK> i'm all for the food chain but you practically see mr fox biting down on their <UNK> surely that's a bit much and also the plot well it's kind of boring i stayed only with the hope of it getting better but instead i just got more and more annoyed at mr fox and his son ash for making stupid decisions br br the humour meanwhile falls flat i laughed only once or twice even though i specifically <UNK> attempts at jokes i think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and <UNK> the voice actors have no sense of comic timing instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain <UNK> george clooney aims to portray mr fox as charming and <UNK> but his voice has no character meryl streep shows no emotion i didn't even realise bill murray had a role until the end credits and ash twelve years old in fox years sounds like he's about 30 br br i love animation particularly stop motion but the visual style actually <UNK> me out a little bit characters are tall <UNK> and lacking any warmth of design they move with very little <UNK> and often the animation is jerky and strange there is also a distinctive <UNK> <UNK> feel as <UNK> <UNK> are added in <UNK> and <UNK> characters look straight at the camera and talked it was very awkward there was one or two moments when <UNK> looked straight at the camera didn't move and had <UNK> on his <UNK> it actually freaked me out br br fantastic mr fox had so much potential lots of people still seem to like it look at the reviews maybe it just wasn't for me
<START> i caught this movie by accident on cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it's entirety and i'm glad i did i was immediately drawn by the storyline and cared about the girls involved naive high school <UNK> best friends since childhood take a high school trip and are taken in by a con man named nick who get them into serious trouble they are used as <UNK> <UNK> in a heroin <UNK> ring taken in to custody the girls learn to cope with their <UNK> while trying to find a way out of their trouble everything that they try to help themselves falls short when the <UNK> criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the trust of their american lawyer <UNK> hank hank gives up trying to defend them after he feels betrayed by alice claire <UNK> however the <UNK> native wife of hank <UNK> a rat in the case and does some further foot work of investigation and finds out the girls really were <UNK> the end of the movie when alice does a <UNK> act to save <UNK> beckinsale had me in tears i really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it
<START> i've been a fan of all things bill <UNK> for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting of course i am catholic come from a well educated family and go to church of my own <UNK> which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of <UNK> opinions br br <UNK> problem is that he <UNK> that religion is uniformly negative he's correct to document the <UNK> aspects of it i e one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and <UNK> authority of god but that said he never looks at its positive side quite frankly i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the <UNK> of <UNK> where mother <UNK> spent her life working with the <UNK> of the poor she's dead now of course but he could easily visit the <UNK> priest in east la who runs <UNK> <UNK> which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their <UNK> removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit <UNK> <UNK> for advanced catholic studies which has brought together some of the world's finest <UNK> <UNK> and investment <UNK> to study ways in which to <UNK> <UNK> the world's <UNK> countries into global capital <UNK> and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than 1 a day of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his <UNK> beliefs about religion and it's so much easier to continue to make <UNK> superficial jokes br br that fits into the other large problem with <UNK> movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is in this movie you have <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a <UNK> christian truck stop service in a night club with a dutch guy who <UNK> pot all the time with the minister of a <UNK> church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ and with an actor playing jesus at a holy land theme park br br what you won't see in <UNK> film beyond some superficial <UNK> alongside a <UNK> d in grand central station that religion <UNK> <UNK> the brain like drugs do and that religion is the <UNK> of tradition <UNK> on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and <UNK> <UNK> from schools like <UNK> dame <UNK> or <UNK> college who could easily <UNK> <UNK> him in a debate on the matter you won't see any serious discussion of any of the <UNK> of c s lewis g k <UNK> or any <UNK> <UNK> and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non <UNK> <UNK> christianity and islam <UNK> whatsoever all you get at the end of the day is a <UNK> example of a condescending <UNK> <UNK> from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it br br i get a lot of what <UNK> saying but for someone <UNK> his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic anyone interested in the kind of intellectual <UNK> that indie documentaries typically bring could find more <UNK> in an old <UNK> of the <UNK>
<START> it is of course very nice to see <UNK> on turkish movie industry however i would have expected something more creative from <UNK> <UNK> starting from the script which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think especially the cheesiness of the dialogs which were putting the audience in a position that as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations which most of the times makes the movie unbearable it also has an obvious ending you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning the weakest part of the scenario is that the <UNK> of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people like professionals right away did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy <UNK> to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film and that scene was so suitable for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> title those are not the only weak parts of the movie there were also a lot of <UNK> in the film the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from <UNK> also appearance of <UNK> in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it gen is a total disappointment i would have wonder if <UNK> was not this famous would <UNK> be able to shoot this movie with this much of budget amount i hope <UNK> would realize that it is not <UNK> to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview it was hitchcock who did it wisely and night <UNK> continued it successfully he should be aware of the fact that he is not hitchcock nor <UNK> yet hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry
<START> a special day <UNK> <UNK> italy canada 1977 br br every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve this one offers a very simple premise almost <UNK> executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time it's surprising <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is relatively <UNK> even hated by some critics time out calls it <UNK> and leonard <UNK> somewhat <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> ' i disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist italy than most films i've seen the cinematography is distinctly <UNK> even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the film's relative <UNK> considering late '70s audiences weren't exactly spoiled with great italian films it's even stranger this one didn't really catch on with the critics br br the film begins with a ten minute <UNK> of archive footage from hitler's visit to italy on may <UNK> 1938 set against this background we first meet <UNK> loren a lonely love ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building one day when her <UNK> escapes she meets her <UNK> <UNK> mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the <UNK> he is well mannered <UNK> and soon she is attracted to him during the whole film we hear the fascist <UNK> from the radio of the <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings after the opening scene the camera <UNK> across the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we haven't met yet br br <UNK> <UNK> and sophia loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type canadian born john <UNK> plays <UNK> husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene i figure his voice must have been dubbed since he's not of italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so i cannot imagine he speaks italian if his voice has been dubbed i didn't notice at all on the contrary he's completely believable as an italian even more than the rest of the cast the story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesn't come off as overly pretentious but works completely don't miss out on this one br br camera <UNK> 9 10
<START> i usually comment only on movies that i like <UNK> everyone to his her own taste but here i want to make an exception the premise of this movie which somehow seems to get lost in the <UNK> is that these two self centered adults have a perfect right to go off to las vegas get drunk get married and <UNK> <UNK> suffering upon their respective <UNK> of children even allowing for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and <UNK> what they have set in motion after all love is all that's important isn't it to hell with everybody else whether or not things work out in the end is really not the point in fact it's quite irrelevant the point is that <UNK> for others especially if they are young persons and especially if they are in a position of <UNK> is made light of and thereby <UNK> by this movie there are far more <UNK> <UNK> these parents could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a <UNK>
<START> kenneth branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of shakespeare's most classic and well written tragedy kenneth plays the role of hamlet with such a distinct emotion that <UNK> tears kate <UNK> performance is also of great note
<START> thankfully he hasn't yet this is crude simplistic student politics made into drama it needs the viewer to buy into a series of <UNK> <UNK> 1 that a british <UNK> could be <UNK> from being basically right of centre to being <UNK> far left <UNK> 2 that all debate in the media and the general public is <UNK> ended and that the new prime <UNK> only critics are sinister civil servants <UNK> big business and the americans naturally <UNK> 3 that this radical <UNK> <UNK> can solve all union economic and social problems with <UNK> ease in a way that <UNK> the nation <UNK> 4 that <UNK> all ties with the us and <UNK> is a good thing <UNK> 5 that the soviet union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's and finally <UNK> 6 that the <UNK> forces of the us would <UNK> seek to launch a coup <UNK> against britain br br it's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti <UNK> feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its <UNK> when it was made television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience ray <UNK> performance was great which is one of the few plus points history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show
<START> i've seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films but i don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did br br the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would <UNK> us all and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris <UNK> and <UNK> had anything to do with this turkey <UNK> or <UNK> br br the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched what's worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable br br harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie ain't that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose <UNK> in the history of cinema
<START> a must for any punk rocker this is the movie that made the ramones a household name back in the early 1980's when it first appeared on <UNK> cable stations this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movies with a cult classic status up there with the rocky horror picture show originally the producers wanted cheap trick as the stars but the release of the live at <UNK> album had just made them <UNK> and too hot an item to be in a low budget movie very good luck for the ramones who were looking to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market which sadly never happened until after the bands demise the band dee dee especially always disliked the movie through the 80's but the fans always loved and could <UNK> most of the movie while waiting to get into ramones shows this movie like most classics is stupid fun with some classic ramones footage in their <UNK> don't expect more you won't find it it's great fun so enjoy it another allan <UNK> classic movie in a similar vein is get crazy featuring lee <UNK> from the legendary hardcore punk band fear
<START> what a boring film to sum it all up its was basically just <UNK> <UNK> beating up his daughter in law <UNK> kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasn't too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of it br br the best part of the whole movie was the song <UNK> <UNK> and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was a piece of crap
<START> i just saw this film last night at toronto film festival where it was playing under the midnight madness section to tell you the truth the only reason why i went for this movie was because it shared its name with the <UNK> song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so i really didn't have a choice d i went in expecting it to be something like the silence of the <UNK> but it turned out to be semi gore flick somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct i really couldn't care less if <UNK> character got her <UNK> ripped out by the creep i was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with <UNK> character getting her just <UNK> christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film however the story is rather weak but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively the score by a <UNK> band called the insects was top notch that more than anything else really scared the crap out of me br br the director was a really decent <UNK> and was quite entertaining during the q a session i really do hope he gets to make better films in the future br br this one is strictly for genre fans but i'd recommend non fans to give this a try anyway it was a fun ride
<START> this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an audience br br the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story and who could forget <UNK> the beautiful guide dog in the series br br whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings in new orleans the acting and the music i note the comment about the music score in other comments i remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even better br br well you never know one day paramount might just dig into its <UNK> and release it on dvd
<START> i was lucky enough to catch this movie while <UNK> at the <UNK> film festival i've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of william castle so this was definitely a must see for me br br this is about the life and work of william castle who in my opinion was an underrated director true he made some cheap budget <UNK> horror films but he added something to these films real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore for example he had <UNK> in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put <UNK> at the <UNK> of <UNK> in the <UNK> br br this is truly a well made documentary and brings this rather <UNK> director into the light and celebrated his <UNK> to horror cinema it also paints castle as a larger than life character who was very well liked and had a smile on his face br br unlike most film documentaries that mostly show <UNK> from film historians spine <UNK> shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work such as john waters john <UNK> and joe <UNK> a must see for classic horror and sci fi fans
<START> i was looking through the movie <UNK> in my area on <UNK> and seen a movie that had not been advertised i looked closer and noticed that peter falk and paul reiser were in it having watched mad about you once i was not a fan of paul reiser however i am a big fan of peter falk so the <UNK> and i took a chance we were both swept into this story the beautiful scenery the heartfelt acting and the sense of family and moral values that are seldom seen in movies and the world today not that sappy <UNK> junk but real life situations from real life like people i even have to say paul reiser was excellent although i still won't watch mad about you i don't know where this movie has gone i heard it was put out in limited release it should be shared with the world it is one of the finest movies i have seen m
<START> given the title this first follow up to <UNK> 1948 obviously <UNK> the number of w <UNK> <UNK> stories which <UNK> the film the author still turns up to introduce the episodes but <UNK> no <UNK> this time around by the way while the script of the original <UNK> gave sole credit to r c sheriff here <UNK> himself also <UNK> a hand in the adaptation as well as <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in <UNK> as can be expected much of the crew of <UNK> has been <UNK> for the second installment â though this also <UNK> to at least three cast members namely <UNK> wayne <UNK> hyde white and felix <UNK> the last two had bit parts in the episode from <UNK> entitled <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor slightly <UNK> by the third story which takes up more than half the running time <UNK> still done with the <UNK> care acted with <UNK> by a stellar cast and is <UNK> enjoyable into the bargain br br <UNK> <UNK> tells of a church <UNK> james <UNK> â for which the <UNK> title is another word â <UNK> <UNK> after 17 years of service by the new <UNK> priest michael <UNK> simply because <UNK> illiterate rather than rest on his <UNK> despite his age he not only takes a wife his <UNK> played by kathleen harrison but opens a <UNK> shop <UNK> placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered â and with business <UNK> this is developed into a whole chain the last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix <UNK> who not only is surprised to learn of <UNK> lack of education but is <UNK> to ask him what his other interests were â to which the wealthy and respected <UNK> replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a <UNK> br br the second episode <UNK> know <UNK> is the <UNK> but also perhaps the most engaging a voyage at sea is utterly <UNK> by the <UNK> presence of a pompous young man <UNK> patrick british despite his foreign sounding name of <UNK> who <UNK> to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun <UNK> wayne and <UNK> hyde white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most â the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of <UNK> <UNK> to his pretty wife anne crawford during a fancy dress party however the passengers decide to <UNK> their <UNK> on <UNK> by having one of them <UNK> him a <UNK> which he naturally <UNK> appreciate still <UNK> here that he <UNK> to show a decent side to his character â told by crawford that the <UNK> <UNK> wearing is an imitation wayne challenges patrick to name its <UNK> the latter realizes immediately that <UNK> the genuine article and that this would compromise <UNK> position if he were to tell so <UNK> allows himself to be <UNK> <UNK> rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer br br as can also be <UNK> from the title <UNK> deals with the <UNK> patients at such a place â run by <UNK> <UNK> the protagonist is a new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> the various goings on the narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate <UNK> of plot â one humorous the <UNK> between two aged <UNK> long resident at the <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> and john laurie one melodramatic the <UNK> relationship between disgruntled patient raymond <UNK> and long suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies and one bittersweet the romance between <UNK> but charming jean simmons and dashing <UNK> michael <UNK> which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that <UNK> has <UNK> simmons as a <UNK> while <UNK> only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the <UNK>
<START> about twenty minutes into this movie i was already bored quite simply these characters were fairly dull occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn't bad at all however it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes so i would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast i'd call this a disappointment
<START> the <UNK> code was a model of <UNK> <UNK> there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two <UNK> and <UNK> who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the year's best
<START> and possibly closest to the dickens story line although i find the young <UNK> hard to watch who's idea was that period hair surely they could have done better than that scott does an incredible job as scrooge his delivery of some of the lines from dickens finally brought it to life for me edward <UNK> is everything we expect and more of the ghost of christmas present i find g c scott's scrooge much more of a believable <UNK> than the more current version done by patrick stewart the scene christmas morning when scrooge realizes he hasn't <UNK> <UNK> is enough to convince one that scott knows how to act versus <UNK> he's phenomenal here nearly the entire cast is incredible the tiny tim in this version of the christmas carol is a little tough to look at almost too sweet still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday enjoy
<START> oh dear lord they've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a <UNK> <UNK> fest br br the original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero <UNK> he was a man trying to drive from denver to san <UNK> to win a bet why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of <UNK> we're not really sure br br we had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an <UNK> <UNK> and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the <UNK> point that point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together and the road itself <UNK> he lives only to be free and means no ill on anyone we saw several times when there were <UNK> he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on even the cops that were chasing him br br when he saw the <UNK> of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of <UNK> he died like he lived running wide open br br in the remake <UNK> has a whole history including a first name even he's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her <UNK> he is a devoted husband and excited <UNK> father he comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery but they even leave that in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the <UNK> they even gave the part of super soul the blind dj brilliantly portrayed by <UNK> little in the original to jason <UNK> give me a break
<START> i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i <UNK> from the excellent short history of nearly everything and what i was able to choke down in a brief history of time it sounded interesting at times however the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the <UNK> was ridiculous i really started questioning what was being <UNK> at that point but then the <UNK> was the revelation that one of the <UNK> was actually <UNK> some loony named <UNK> completely upset the <UNK> for me br br what a waste of two hours
<START> my name is julia ross is a mesmerizing 1945 b thriller from joseph h lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of hollywood noir films this <UNK> minute gothic <UNK> from columbia pictures came after <UNK> lengthy <UNK> as the <UNK> of a string of poverty row westerns east side kids comedies horror <UNK> including the incredibly bizarre bela lugosi shocker the invisible ghost and standard studio b product secrets of a co ed bombs over <UNK> the <UNK> in san francisco etc all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive mr lewis my name is julia ross as well as so dark the night from the following year introduced a director who had <UNK> the rare and delicate art telling a dark and <UNK> tale <UNK> and <UNK> on the most modest of budgets later lewis productions like gun crazy 1949 and the big <UNK> 1955 despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon <UNK> <UNK> camera work and effective low key lighting and very modest resources br br my name is julia ross probably owes more to the tradition of british mysteries it's set in a studio bound england than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and <UNK> a young woman nina <UNK> agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman dame mae witty two days after her arrival she <UNK> from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identity that of the old woman's daughter in law told that she's been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her <UNK> but before long she begins to piece together the strange and <UNK> truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing george <UNK> most probably murdered his real wife and that she's been <UNK> into <UNK> in a harrowing and sinister scheme much of what <UNK> this otherwise modest tale are the <UNK> touches that lewis brings to the production <UNK> it as the first of his truly serious <UNK> as a film director
<START> neil simon has quite a body of work but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame this film really works jack lemmon walter <UNK> have a great chemistry the supporting cast for this film is stellar as well br br it is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets the script <UNK> with humor from this situation this had been done in some forms previously this is the one that brings it all together in a very good package br br simon has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible it is hard to imagine simon ever <UNK> this
<START> so many educational films are nothing more than mind numbing <UNK> saved only by the fact that mst3k <UNK> them why study industrial arts comes to mind <UNK> the magnificent is actually quite well done it's all about blood the heart and the <UNK> system i admit that i don't remember everything from it but it does a good job explaining everything keeping it serious but entertaining i guess that you can always count on june <UNK> most <UNK> the voice of rocky the <UNK> she plays a deer here br br since <UNK> the magnificent itself may be hard to find probably the best place to see it is in <UNK> a class is watching it while a <UNK> is <UNK>
<START> i loved this episode it is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop <UNK> and save the world i also love this episode because kyle <UNK> bart allen <UNK> and justin hartley oliver queen green arrow are guest starring in it i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe it was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team as <UNK> that would be such a <UNK> thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers also i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for 33 1 i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have
<START> my ten year old liked it for me it was hard to get through it christopher lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny sorry to see jeff daniels in this
<START> the invisible mouse is a delightful and different tom <UNK> cartoon it features the usual cat mouse chases and battles but in a different way this time jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible <UNK> and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of surprises for tom scare him torment him and confuse him br br as much as it is weird it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see jerry invisible it's amusing to see things <UNK> up in the air without seeing who's doing it we know who right it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts it's equally amusing to see jerry eating some <UNK> and <UNK> while he's invisible i really like that <UNK> music which plays when he's not visible br br some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees <UNK> shadow and <UNK> him and even when tom tries to slam him with a <UNK> pan and jerry writes missed me i also like when jerry drinks <UNK> chocolate milk becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face br br overall this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon humor entertainment fun and some nice artwork too
<START> a <UNK> unfunny musical comedy that <UNK> tries to marry the then cutting edge rock <UNK> roll explosion with the middle class sensibilities of a suburban sitcom the result is a <UNK> dated <UNK> mash that will satisfy none of the audience that went for the music but will at least keep their parents <UNK> br br a quick glance at the <UNK> write up on the back of the video release should give some idea of the content tom <UNK> is a drunken agent <UNK> with so little comic ability you almost expect him to <UNK> hi honey i'm home the <UNK> sites him as so funny in 'the 7 year <UNK> it sounds almost like an excuse what other film would sell itself on the fact that a leading player was good in something else it reads like so funny in 'the 7 year <UNK> but he's rubbish in this br br <UNK> a beautiful girl with <UNK> 50 inch <UNK> is unfortunately a bargain basement monroe with all the acting ability and comic timing of a rotting <UNK> her wooden delivery combined with <UNK> <UNK> double takes make this a comedy <UNK> from hell for her part the sell gives us <UNK> <UNK> whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's biggest laughs as you can see a movie sold on the idea that it's lead has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things most of this humour is men literally falling over themselves their glasses cracking upon site of <UNK> etc only the <UNK> nightmare of a milk bottle <UNK> casts doubt upon its u <UNK> br br for the musical side the most <UNK> of players are chosen would you really care to see eddie fontaine offer i love your eyes i love your lips they taste even better than <UNK> <UNK> in a song called cool it baby only the <UNK> little richard breaks out of the <UNK> though is forced to sing some of his more dad friendly songs in a four minute sequence and how come all the acts sing without a single <UNK> attempted <UNK> on the industry are broad and <UNK> in their conception br br technically the picture was quite advanced with special effects including a ghost like julie london and <UNK> color which now looks flat and artificial in fact with its <UNK> that bleed and fake looking flesh tones it resembles a <UNK> movie direction though isn't outstanding and the sound quality is also quite poor br br perhaps it comes down to it being so old a time when men still <UNK> on screen <UNK> cute child actors made adult remarks and black servants only got to cook and dance all of which happen here yet some like it hot the african queen ben <UNK> and many many more stand as examples of films from the period that can still be enjoyed today so the good at the time argument doesn't really stand up at its heart the girl can't help it is a cynical and <UNK> venture that doesn't bear close <UNK> 4 10 br br
<START> i'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the <UNK> of the <UNK> made in 1948 the picture came out a decade after roy <UNK> earliest pictures in which he had a starring role <UNK> character comes off as a bit clueless in this one along with his female co star jane <UNK> who <UNK> her <UNK> between roy and robert <UNK> portraying chief bad guy bill <UNK> the whole story seems kind of muddled with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so like the legend of the <UNK> <UNK> for example which says the <UNK> man comes to life at midnight with andy <UNK> in the cast as cookie <UNK> you would think the story would get a little <UNK> out of that set up instead you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a <UNK> boys flick it was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old <UNK> who truth be told wound up getting more screen time than trigger who's contract as <UNK> horse in the <UNK> didn't have anything to say about getting <UNK> by a <UNK> and then you have <UNK> willing and his riders of the purple <UNK> replacing bob nolan and the sons of the <UNK> for your musical <UNK> i don't know about you but it was already half way into the picture and i was still looking for pat brady oh well br br yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough and that turned out to be <UNK> athletic <UNK> of trigger while still on the run from the bad guys ok it was probably a stunt double but i haven't seen that one before in a couple hundred westerns br br jane <UNK> does the <UNK> as the female lead in this picture as she would in four other films opposite roy in the <UNK> 1948 time frame in under california stars she appeared as andy <UNK> cousin appropriately named caroline <UNK> you're never quite convinced what side she'll come in on in this story though since she starts out pretending to be someone she's not and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident br br fans of the old laurel and hardy films might be as surprised as i was to see james <UNK> here as the sheriff of <UNK> i would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role but he played it pretty straight after all i had to wonder when it was all over why he and old <UNK> <UNK> coleman wound up in the mine <UNK> with cookie when there was no reason for that to be just a way to close it out i guess with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture i hate to be that harsh but if you've seen enough roy rogers flicks you've got to know that this was not one of his <UNK> efforts br br say <UNK> i wonder if that's the same place that grew up to be sin city
<START> firstly this is a very dated film non focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution honestly when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to <UNK> to be intellectual which in itself is quite nonsensical since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual it <UNK> me to despair as if we all should return to being apes in the name of <UNK> it is simply ridiculous our <UNK> is only one of many human qualities but this does not mean we should not <UNK> ourselves to the highest possible degree but no doubt this non educational message ties in with <UNK> use of rock music hence the rolling stones br br the song <UNK> for the <UNK> whose creation we witness and from which the film takes its name is in fact nothing special the <UNK> sequence which is not especially original was used to much better effect in led <UNK> <UNK> led <UNK> ii apart form that <UNK> mick jagger <UNK> in his usually <UNK> manner rather like bob dylan notice how the first <UNK> phrase is <UNK> repeated over again to form the <UNK> br br besides the fact that the black <UNK> depicted in this film don't seem to know what they are fighting for the most interesting scenes involve the <UNK> of <UNK> with pornography a message that in fact <UNK> the sexual <UNK> of the 1960s and today indeed a message that would <UNK> the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made br br no wonder the dvd came free with the sunday times for a truly profound historical exposition of left wing sympathy listen to <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> sole <UNK>
<START> if you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood let it be boy but prepare yourself by bringing your <UNK> if it comes with a radio br br after having watched such a good movie as <UNK> 2003 it is terrible to see what they come up with again in <UNK> it seems that the only idea is to make money but no one seems seriously to work on the image of <UNK> in the world of entertainment that it is a <UNK> world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in <UNK> and since the <UNK> public <UNK> everything that is presented to them as <UNK> in <UNK> with a flavor of the west they get away with it br br ok the story is nice to begin with and it could have developed into a nice flick but did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music or at least good <UNK> and secondly good choreography in this movie the <UNK> is so bad that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sing <UNK> and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie br br the choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning <UNK> but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical they only forgot to change the choreography it is hardly dancing you see they jump here and there throw their legs up in the air and that is about it br br well at least there's a happy ending but if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice <UNK> dinner is much more romantic do so
<START> this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the censors br br overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be <UNK> rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider a film that <UNK> to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter <UNK> a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies
<START> after a quasi gothic all <UNK> music video the movie starts with cassidy the lead singer killing herself in a perfect world that would be that and the end credits would roll we don't live n that world the insipid band members decide to go to some clown to contact her dead essence when i say clown i mean actual clown he tell them they're all going to die via <UNK> ghost the spirit possesses <UNK> one of the band mates we couldn't care less as the characters are all boring vapid and extremely horribly acted written by adam <UNK> an incredibly <UNK> <UNK> if there ever was one and directed by corbin <UNK> who after the attendant and tower of blood has to know that he keeps making crap for a living this movie s a constant battle between the film's incompetence and the viewer's need to stay awake not enough blood to <UNK> gore <UNK> nor enough nudity to satisfy <UNK> this movie in fact has absolutely nothing to recommend to absolutely anyone br br my grade f br br eye candy amanda <UNK> gets topless br br where i saw it <UNK> on demand
<START> those who are not familiar with <UNK> <UNK> alter ego elvira then this is a good place to start br br elvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity <UNK> boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money br br unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of <UNK> <UNK> having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things a house a dog and a <UNK> the town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral <UNK> of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan <UNK> because he wants her <UNK> seems that the <UNK> is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful <UNK> br br the film is actually pretty funny with peterson a k a elvira using her <UNK> and <UNK> as a joke and don't forget tomorrow we're showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the <UNK> scene is the perfect example deserves a <UNK> the film not her boobs of course
<START> so so special effects get in the way of <UNK> the interesting relationship between uncle martin and tim o'hara that we remember from the tv series and what was with the suit annoying
<START> the episodic version of robert <UNK> starship troopers plays out at a <UNK> slow pace following johnny rico leaving his parents the not very attractive girl he <UNK> for and joining the mobile <UNK> the aliens in the show are nothing like the <UNK> bugs from the film instead being <UNK> like monsters that shoot <UNK> out of their mouths br br throughout watching this version i was continually amazed at just how <UNK> they've managed to make the whole thing the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the <UNK> and the <UNK> prolonged <UNK> they give each other through their battle <UNK> <UNK> with 80s <UNK> pop sometimes arriving during the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes in terms of construction it owes a debt to top gun sharing much in terms of pacing and content and all that implies
<START> don't get me wrong i want to see marijuana <UNK> as much as the next guy i shall <UNK> now the writing though was unrealistic a <UNK> mom dealing drugs but <UNK> about her drugs getting into the hands of an <UNK> person give me a break the <UNK> of very pretty mary louise <UNK> character was an insult to my intelligence the characters were not at all likable basically the plot lines went nowhere i understand its only tv land the <UNK> was blatant mary louise parker is supposed to be a great mom and i am supposed to believe this why i just got the feeling i was being <UNK> by a show <UNK> of <UNK> its like saying its ok to cheat on your wife but with someone of legal age status ok not exactly the same thing but i think you people get my point that save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign <UNK> i guess but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a <UNK> mom as the local pot dealer
<START> very slick very pre <UNK> code and still very sassy i would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a fan of <UNK> she's funny she's sexy she's hard working and love that <UNK> she gets br br barbara <UNK> is fantastic as a <UNK> of a <UNK> who rises up in the world perfectly portrayed by a bank building john wayne in a suit plays one of her first <UNK> br br the last three minutes are a letdown but the sets the lines the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising <UNK> in the <UNK> position
<START> this has been put out on the dvd market by <UNK> and it's for die hard boris karloff fans like <UNK> only it's not a horror flick but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist <UNK> to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his <UNK> nothing all hell breaks loose br br it's <UNK> enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious especially from the leading lady <UNK> <UNK> who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double crossed wife br br but proceed with much caution
<START> given the people involved it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull the writer david ward wrote the amazing caper film the <UNK> two years later jane fonda had just won an academy award for <UNK> and donald sutherland had just done excellent work in films like <UNK> start the revolution without me and kelly's heroes <UNK> the movie is a caper tale with a small gang of bumbling <UNK> planning a big heist at the same time the movie wants to be hip satire a series of comedy sketches of the type that the nbc television show saturday night would do so well two years later the bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the <UNK> comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have it is quite literally a movie that keeps <UNK> into itself just as the cars in the cars in the <UNK> scenes run into each other br br the only real interest for me was watching jane fonda her <UNK> caine is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic <UNK> daniels prostitute character in <UNK> yet one doesn't believe her for a moment it is always jane fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching it is as terrible a performance as her performance in <UNK> was terrific it would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic it suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors
<START> i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such third rate <UNK> as <UNK> for starters the storyline is totally implausible  <UNK> son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self <UNK> so what does he do he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a <UNK> of judges i honestly am not joking here in the meantime his dad is dying of lung cancer but keeps it a secret from the son but he survives long enough to see his son become famous to see his new <UNK> and also make a new toy <UNK> with his own hands br br the acting is cringe worthy in its <UNK>  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film as usual for indian films the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively <UNK> by the concerns of the real world br br to be honest the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film the actors such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar will still be <UNK> as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood
<START> i thought this film would be a lot better then it was it sounded like a spoof off of the spy <UNK> and the start of it reminded me of <UNK> but this film came up short br br the plot is just to ridiculous the <UNK> and soviet union in russia have started up a spy school to teach their <UNK> how to act like americans but the town they set up in it for training is a bit dated so they grab two <UNK> from the us to spice things up i don't know but this seems just to out there it gets really odd when next to no one in this all russian town speaks in a russian accent someone screwed up in the casting job br br also for a comedy this is painfully dry there is one two funny spots tops and they are nothing to sing and dance about the film in the end will likely put you to sleep br br and as a twisted punch in the face this film is so pro the us it makes me sick the movie keeps on saying again and again the us is god and russia is the devil this is the kind of <UNK> campaign that was done against the japanese in world war 2 it's films like these that makes everyone think that the us is full of itself br br this gets a 4 out of 10 and i'm being kind it should really get a one but the dance scene was funny but then again it dragged far to long to be really funny
<START> it's difficult to not have a liking for israeli director <UNK> fox and for his movies which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these <UNK> besides he also gave voice to the young generations and to the remarkable part of them who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the <UNK> of people both in israel both in <UNK> these reasons in my opinion are sufficient to consider fox a noteworthy director even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control however the fans of his movies that he realized on team with gal <UNK> his producer co screenwriter and also life companion seem to not being <UNK> by this since his new feature the bubble ha <UNK> is having the same success of the previous <UNK> jagger and walk on the water announced as a contemporary gay version of romeo juliet set in the present day tel <UNK> instead of <UNK> and with two men one israeli and the other palestinian at the place of the two shakespearean young lovers the film actually is quite different from that or better it's also something else in fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man noam played by the fox regular <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> jagger but i must confess i miss jagger the astonishing <UNK> <UNK> and his two co <UNK> a guy and a girl chose to live around thirty years old restless witty and firm despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a <UNK> on the frontier with the <UNK> to live a life that won't be only made of war the two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they <UNK> love and support each other their lives are destined to change when noam falls in love with <UNK> the tv star <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a young palestinian who came to live in tel <UNK> the laws so far in force among the group are neglected but not the will to aid one friend still it won't be easy for noam and his friends 'cause <UNK> is <UNK> in israel and in the meantime his family who lives in <UNK> and doesn't know he's gay is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl who is a relative of <UNK> beloved sister <UNK> to be who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong <UNK> in the development of the plot with consequences not just for the two men because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace interesting <UNK> if not automatic are stubborn and so the tragedy is <UNK> even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between noam and <UNK> meets with it doesn't the overlook the other characters which turn out well written for example <UNK> the boyfriend of <UNK> <UNK> fellow tenant introduced as a lively <UNK> and then <UNK> as a <UNK> and more open minded person and <UNK> performed besides the two leads we <UNK> disregard the funny <UNK> <UNK> and the lovely <UNK> <UNK> the girl of the gang moreover late <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> appears as himself in a cameo it also <UNK> the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones even if the director can't do without a melodramatic conclusion i watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime i often thought about it proof that fox and his pal have a knack to strike home
<START> gunga din 1939 is based on <UNK> <UNK> poem the movie is directed by george stevens it's set in india during the 19th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments the three leading men are brilliant cary grant is sgt <UNK> cutter victor mclaglen is sgt <UNK> <UNK> and douglas fairbanks jr the son of the legendary you know who is sgt thomas <UNK> let's not forget the other fine players who include sam <UNK> playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is <UNK> <UNK> it's awfully fun to watch the difficulties of <UNK> and <UNK> wedding plans gunga din is awfully lot of fun it can be funny it can be thrilling it can be everything a good movie requires
<START> bell book and candle was shown recently on cable not having seen it for a while we decided to take another look at this comedy based on the james van <UNK> broadway hit which was a vehicle for rex harrison and <UNK> <UNK> in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by daniel <UNK> the film was directed by richard <UNK> who turned the play into a delightful comedy br br evidently judging by some of the comments <UNK> by imdb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had <UNK> on vertigo released the same year movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released in fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women br br the film set in manhattan during christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera <UNK> her no matter what was she playing as the witch that becomes human her gillian is charming james stewart who plays the <UNK> <UNK> henderson is also seen at his best mr stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top br br in supporting roles the wonderful elsa <UNK> playing <UNK> is a welcome addition to any movie as she proves here jack <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the brother of gillian is also good ernie <UNK> is also seen as the writer sidney <UNK> br br this is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching bell book and candle
<START> plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting nevertheless br br development is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed nothing shocking too much nothing <UNK> movie sitcom style br br i liked woody excellent performance had to fight the plot <UNK> and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows
<START> this one grew on me i love the r d <UNK> music and in spite of the <UNK> elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re watching the movie the brother sister plot line is powerful i thought there's also more probably obligatory stuff like bar fights a loony crime story etc that are just distracting though not unfunny from a certain point of view also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it br br like many of the bollywood movies i've seen this one is melodramatic and opera like including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has <UNK> to <UNK> seeking to re connect with this girl grown up and troubled she had been told her brother and mother were dead numbing her pain with drugs br br a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement which brought <UNK> of <UNK> to india from an indian point of view that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> of their own societies but nonetheless in india living only for the pleasures of the moment the hippie singing dancing <UNK> scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone i'm old enough to remember and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white <UNK> out kids are actual hippie extras as i remember hearing about kids on the <UNK> to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood br br it is not about the actual <UNK> <UNK> movement though the movie hippies sing a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as do a group of actual indian <UNK> unrelated to the hippies in the opening scene of the movie br br virginia
<START> <UNK> <UNK> i've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing man was he right on the nose this movie was acted by pure amateurs they had to have done one take maybe two on each scene the movie seemed <UNK> rushed the script was also poor they had lines that tried to be unique but failed miserably get your <UNK> off of me oh man i hate it when movies try to do that it happens all the time with comedies but with a horror movie and with below average actors the results are incredibly pathetic the lines and scenarios were all very predictable but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was again the damn acting it was awful besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth i thought he was great br br the movie is about 5 stupid <UNK> t tourist who are on a vacation in asia they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex <UNK> sounds like a cool story but watching someone with a bad case of <UNK> is probably more fun and intense to watch the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing there wasn't a trace of suspense br br i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little <UNK> on this but unfortunately with a huge capital u the movie was incredibly disappointing i did enjoy the <UNK> break and the blood effects the <UNK> chicks were also so so br br everything about this movie screams amateur this is ryan <UNK> first feature length and for the most part he failed there's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror i pray his next movie doesn't play out like another b horror flick unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be even after this disappointment i'm willing to give ryan another shot from what i've seen of him he's a true dedicated man to the genre good luck next time because this was bad news
<START> a very good movie a classic sci fi film with humor action and everything this movie offers a greater number of aliens we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the <UNK> forces the emperor is somewhat an original character i liked the ewoks representing somehow the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> excellent references i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga in return of the jedi the <UNK> of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls i also appreciated the victory celebration where it <UNK> <UNK> redemption and returns hi into <UNK> skywalker spirit along with <UNK> and <UNK> wan it gives a sadness and a tear the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor luke watches and finds comfort in seeing <UNK> wan <UNK> and his father 1997 version not hayden <UNK> the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending i felt there was much more than meets the eye and as always the john <UNK> music will bring the <UNK> into star wars universe
<START> i liked this movie it was pretty cool it has it all cars gun shooting fighting and even a token girl it does not <UNK> in any of this things with the exception of the cars a bit of shooting a bit of fighting a bit of <UNK> around and <UNK> of car with a great chase near the end the jump you may say is <UNK> but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible so the movie <UNK> as bad as people are painting it it has some quality and i liked to watch it in fact i loved the film and i <UNK> need to turn off my brains to watch it i <UNK> always thinking is this possible or tramp like that 9 in 10
<START> i honestly don't understand how tripe like this gets made the worst junior high talent show skit you've ever seen is more entertaining than this film will <UNK> wrestling fetish provides the only briefly humorous moments utterly horrible
<START> i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around 2 00 a m so i <UNK> <UNK> through the channels and happened upon h b o where this classic was playing initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as <UNK> at his <UNK> diner and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting but certainly not worth watching basically if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep <UNK> works much better however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound but even that can get annoying
<START> i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time i got into the series very late season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents <UNK> digital video <UNK> box while i was house sitting for the weekend it took that one episode for me to be hook line and <UNK> into the world of jack bauer and boy was i hooked i watched the next six episodes without <UNK> an eye the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an <UNK> month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i've ever spent i watched the first three seasons in three weeks that's <UNK> forty minute episodes i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week i find it mildly <UNK> and cruel but i'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america the <UNK> is set and you can bet i'll be <UNK> at the bit
<START> <UNK> palace is truly a one of a kind it's an amazing story showing two girl's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about br br alice <UNK> claire danes and <UNK> davis kate beckinsale are two best friends <UNK> out of high school they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand and are immediately captivated by a young man nick parks he <UNK> with them both and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend br br when the two arrive at the airport they are immediately searched for drugs someone <UNK> off customs and in an instant their life is changed forever in the mix of the confusion of <UNK> into their new life they learn about a highly respected lawyer named hank green bill <UNK> br br an american who knows the <UNK> justice system he fights for the girl to be free but they soon find out when they leave or go is all up to them br br if you're looking for a great movie that'll stay with you for years <UNK> palace is definitely the way to go
<START> then they will have a proper place to file this crap sorry not a mystery as claimed it is religious <UNK> <UNK> i kept waiting for the <UNK> evil that was promised me but the evil in this flick would only be <UNK> by a five year old with learning <UNK> br br i can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment unfortunately it has <UNK> changed my opinion of them and i will likely avoid anything they do in the future i'm also a little <UNK> off that i now have a writer's name and director's name to <UNK> as i'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too br br it's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics <UNK> on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 etc will get their reviews posted first this could lead to more people getting tricked as i was into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching br br well it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising too bad they can't give me back the <UNK> minutes i wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a hollywood horror supernatural film
<START> the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her she is beaten <UNK> <UNK> around in the chair endlessly has her finger nails pulled animal guts are thrown at her hot <UNK> water is <UNK> on her and finally her <UNK> is <UNK> with a <UNK> really sick and nasty scene the makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape of course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome i have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and sadistic but less disturbing anyway this one is a must see for horror fans
<START> a serious comedy ross hunter produced movie version of the french play les <UNK> de la <UNK> later <UNK> as a very rich woman is <UNK> well cast occasionally funny and unfortunately timeless a wealthy california widow who appears to be <UNK> away her money is <UNK> by her two grown greedy daughters both of whom are afraid mama <UNK> is <UNK> spending their inheritance the whole issue of a vital but aged woman sent to a rest home against her will and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing is <UNK> material for a comedy and to his credit director david <UNK> rich doesn't <UNK> the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment some of the humor is a little broad and doesn't work yet <UNK> russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note sandra dee is also good as <UNK> <UNK> and james <UNK> is very charming as a young lawyer the movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time that the seriousness of <UNK> 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending the picture leaves you smiling and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky from
<START> prior to this film i had only seen two films by director <UNK> <UNK> the trashy zombie flick le <UNK> del <UNK> 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man child peter <UNK> and the <UNK> sleazy giallo strip nude for your killer neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh br br the story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are <UNK> during their shoot is confusing and oh so boring when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters <UNK> among themselves and doing very little of note br br the only point of interest about the film is that its producer lucio fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega gory movie cat in the brain aka nightmare concert and if you've already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with massacre
<START> this is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning it will give you that warm fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face br br sure we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories but it does do the trick entertain br br being from sweden and living in the us for quite sometime it is funny how we react the <UNK> husband is going to kill him she <UNK> is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger than life ending we know how these things work everything comes together at the end and it did the characters were somewhat simple they were so elaborate that you didn't really think twice about it nothing was really left for your own imagination the closest would probably be <UNK> she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with daniel but that's about it br br but the movie is beautiful set in rural <UNK> the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable michael <UNK> is truly genius with his crazy unique look and <UNK> <UNK> is charming and <UNK> maybe a little too nice br br but most of all this movie makes you feel and that is the most important thing you cry you laugh you hate and you identify i don't know about you guys but that does not happen that often
<START> this one minute film is arguably the first movie ever made other <UNK> had previously filmed actions like <UNK> motion photography of a <UNK> but the <UNK> brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium at the time of course their <UNK> must have <UNK> their peers including their subjects in this first instance the brothers record employees leaving their factory some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera the <UNK> attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a <UNK> but la <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> doesn't nearly match the <UNK> of their later films the most interesting aspect of this short film is the <UNK> selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world's people a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today br br rating 8
<START> the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges curly <UNK> moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team br br one of my favorite stooges shorts with <UNK> is none other than husbands beware all appearing in this short are the beautiful christine <UNK> dee green doris <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> johnny <UNK> nancy <UNK> <UNK> leonard <UNK> gates and <UNK> <UNK> green and <UNK> provide great performances here there are so many funny parts here this is a very hilarious short there is another similar three stooges short like this one called <UNK> <UNK> and i recommend both
<START> americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial we tend to lose interest really fast br br i found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension <UNK> <UNK> and do it on a schedule and guess what they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelings br br surprisingly when i was bored watching late night <UNK> and decided to actually watch this film i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging br br i just don't usually watch that much late night tv so i can't recommend this film unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life
<START> i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new extremes br br it is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys <UNK> themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish br br a <UNK> on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs br br
<START> <UNK> tank police is an exercise in <UNK> film making the storyline across the 4 parts <UNK> mindless action slap stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions it's hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode a must see movie for anyone who likes anime
<START> last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made capote and infamous br br i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 a stark powerful and <UNK> brutal drama <UNK> to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks elmer <UNK> cat on a hot tin roof the professional <UNK> jungle br br it is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film br br this is a film that stays with you after viewing
<START> this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s 1960s that he sold with gimmicks in 13 ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in b w the <UNK> had theatre seats <UNK> with a <UNK> that <UNK> the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre <UNK> <UNK> a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people <UNK> to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is <UNK> very funny and absolutely riveting it's very short under 90 minutes and there's never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great
<START> i remember when i first saw this short i was really laughing so hard that like with a lot of other films that i have seen no sound came out curly is really great at singing opera in this one i am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer because he was really good br br if you noticed this was filmed near the end of <UNK> career as a <UNK> you could really tell he had changed because he had lost weight and was thinner his voice was <UNK> his face was getting <UNK> with <UNK> though he still could pull it off he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty this was because he was suffering many minor <UNK> before his big one that ended his career be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones br br if you don't mind the fact that curly was really getting very ill at this point this is actually one of their funniest shorts i know that i didn't mind the fact that curly was really changing because i still thought that he was great br br 10 10
<START> shakespeare behind bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> complex in <UNK> kentucky who have raped murdered <UNK> and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important popular and celebrated in acting there are <UNK> themes to <UNK> <UNK> with their <UNK> <UNK> and search for <UNK> and redemption for their past lives as we follow a generous non <UNK> director who gives up his time each year to direct certain inmates in a chosen play by william shakespeare this time around the <UNK> that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its <UNK> focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they <UNK> and relate to we are introduced to each actor in <UNK> interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them <UNK> each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with <UNK> music over each in a traditional documentary sense the strongest and most respected <UNK> it would seem is <UNK> the director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in <UNK> and later hal and allows a longer more in depth observation into the man and his personality his presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him hal is the same at the beginning of the film he has other things that he does to pass the time that's shown as a comfortable <UNK> as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme again through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by hal and nicely shot <UNK> of <UNK> body language not the close ups of his uncertain hand movement not only observed with him but others as well in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not accept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite <UNK> and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he <UNK> himself above all of them in particular to ron who already has a frustrating <UNK> in his acting the relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and <UNK> to achieve something great for themselves with nice if not clichéd motions of time passing by with titles <UNK> everything seems to go right in the first act and then on the build up to the public performance things predictably go wrong an <UNK> of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger newer <UNK> gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big but in the end disappoints all and does not live up to their expectation one <UNK> in particular big g <UNK> the new <UNK> actor rick with an evident will to <UNK> him into their beloved <UNK> and hopefully become a good role model the film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when rick is put in the <UNK> for getting new <UNK> something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random <UNK> in the yard and asks him when he got a <UNK> that's on his arm and we learn it's a <UNK> <UNK> in the facility and big <UNK> disappointment is understood deeply a happy ending it all looks great when they are performing successfully even being invited to perform elsewhere and a sense of real <UNK> echoes around them but in the end the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them it is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no matter what redemption they seek in acting these plays they won't be free men their proud performances and recognition is <UNK> by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long <UNK> that <UNK> with the lights turning off and doors <UNK> is a powerful image of their <UNK> the director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and what's happening to them now
<START> there is an excellent reason edison went straight to video it would have landed in theaters with a <UNK> <UNK> the movie lasted entirely too long and was <UNK> boring just a notch above <UNK> thanks to freeman and spacey who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non existent as justin <UNK> acting i hate to knock the guy but the sooner he realizes that pop is his <UNK> the better br br the movie isn't all bad just mostly i like the fact that ll cool j was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man he deserves it and unlike his fellow musician and co star he can act kevin spacey is almost always enjoyable as well you can see him <UNK> several times as he <UNK> the scenery and freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars out of ten he's not that good br br when all is said and done the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo action <UNK> that fails to keep anyone awake it also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters all in all <UNK> just plain boring that being said rent this when you are suffering from insomnia
<START> first of all the movie is an ingenious work of art movie the plot was filled with surprises a little kid pretends to be a grown up <UNK> one million dollars and how he spends it i mean how whacked out is this walt disney really <UNK> themselves this time the comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok it also teaches a lot about wise <UNK> and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants but also it sucks how the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free that's like let a killer get <UNK> free for ten years if i were to do that i'd get beaten with a <UNK> <UNK> a huge stick that <UNK> when used to <UNK> your <UNK> really hard that kid is really lucky back to the story the movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it's not perfect the acting was good and bad the kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were <UNK> the special effects on the other hand was lame plus this movie isn't based on reality i hated and loved it at the same time
<START> this film takes place in the 1950s according to this the dead called zombies have <UNK> to eat the living however a company has developed a collar that when put around the zombies neck makes them <UNK> and perfect servants the <UNK> mom helen carrie anne moss dad bill dylan baker and son timmy <UNK> ray hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one tim names the zombie fido billy connolly and becomes friends with him but his dad hates him and timmy <UNK> control of fido and things go wrong br br as you can see this is among many other things a <UNK> on the <UNK> series with fido being a stand in for <UNK> timmy was named that for a reason every single of the famous <UNK> episodes are <UNK> here my favorite is when timmy sends fido off to get help before the zombies eat him also it's a satire of those 1950s douglas sirk films where everything is bright and colorful but dark secrets are <UNK> people apart the characters wear very bright 1950s clothes moss is always in a dress the <UNK> settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors even when the script becomes <UNK> there's always something to look at the script is good but there are only so many <UNK> jokes you can make the <UNK> are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off everyone here is excellent and right on target even connolly as an <UNK> zombie does a good job moss is the best playing each line for all its worth but never going overboard br br this isn't for everybody of course the satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame the gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously so for some people this will really work i give it an 8
<START> i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison br br a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that <UNK> up a <UNK> <UNK> system to the point where they become <UNK> killers or something somehow seagal is supposed to stop the <UNK> or its the end of the world or something seagal also went through hit <UNK> like <UNK> every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know <UNK> <UNK> prevent him from yelling at the top of his <UNK> but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close like i said it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and <UNK> stabbing rather than straight up fighting the problem was it wasn't really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old <UNK> <UNK> seagal killed them all <UNK> i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new <UNK> ask seagal to come to the strip club with them br br 2 out of 10
<START> this is the first out of the guinea pig series and is one of the more infamous films out of the collection br br it took me a long time to finally man up and get my hands on a copy of this notorious group of films i bought the guinea pig box set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date so i popped this sucker in and sat down br br from what i had read on the internet and realizing the content involved in this film i was expecting to test my nerves in full force this ended up not being the case br br the film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point and how long a human can tolerate pain br br sounds like one sick flick right wrong the film fails to shock this may be because i have become <UNK> over the years do to my obsession with horror but i think it is safe to say that any true <UNK> could sit through this with ease br br on the other hand an individual who does not have a well knowledge of this type of film will most likely be overwhelmed and disgusted by the images they see on the screen though it failed to shock me the film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence including the ripping out of <UNK> intestines thrown at an unconscious woman and a <UNK> through the eye br br overall i think for majority of the <UNK> on this board that you should just get your hands on a copy of this film for the novelty of it but i suggest that for any new <UNK> to these type of films that you should work your way up to this one
<START> i thought this film was just about perfect the <UNK> <UNK> you'll read about this movie don't do it justice the plot just does not sound very interesting but it is just rent it and you will not be sorry
<START> <UNK> peterson originally created elvira as the television <UNK> of late night horror films and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson she reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s and the film elvira mistress of the dark was the result br br the plot is <UNK> television horror film <UNK> elvira dreams of success in las vegas when her great aunt dies she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show she is disappointed to find she has inherited a <UNK> house a <UNK> and an old book it happens that the town is <UNK> beyond all description and she <UNK> righteous <UNK> everywhere she goes it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil <UNK> and very intent on laying hands on the old book throw in a few teenagers a stud <UNK> and a hateful woman with <UNK> and there you go br br no one would <UNK> it of being a cinematic masterpiece and it does drag now and then but <UNK> peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish <UNK> sexy and mixing <UNK> humor with flashes of sharp comedy she dances through the film like a <UNK> in a circus of corny and often self mocking jokes from a <UNK> disaster to witchcraft <UNK> she is never less than wildly entertaining it's a tremendous amount of fun and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day well i don't want to give anything away so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out br br dvd quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge and if you've never seen <UNK> <UNK> you're in for a treat recommended br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> released on dvd in the uk as axe the choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department the story is almost non existent resulting in a film which <UNK> mostly of people wandering around a dark building with the exception of two characters who are quite obviously destined to be the film's survivors everyone is thoroughly <UNK> meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered the deaths aren't gory enough unless a brief shot of a pound of <UNK> <UNK> covered in fake blood turns your stomach and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick br br the <UNK> thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world's largest nightclub there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms unlike any club i've ever seen where they are picked off by an unseen <UNK> for a low budget effort the production values are okay and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors but with not nearly enough genuine scares a <UNK> to get really messy this is a slasher so where's the graphic splatter way too much dreadful dialogue particularly from the not dead soon enough drummer and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style the movie quickly becomes extremely boring
<START> the worlds largest inside joke the world's largest most <UNK> inside joke br br <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> humor of office space this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal <UNK> writing books the audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist br br the entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time listening to music and writing a novel while working these are his goals you can't imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those <UNK> but then gives it up the director and screenwriter <UNK> kornbluth and josh kornbluth completely remove the audience's motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof br br apart from that major stumbling block the legal secretary <UNK> humor fails because they must be explained <UNK> to the audience each time they happen without these <UNK> the audience wouldn't have noticed anything particularly strange humor is only effective if it doesn't need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny
<START> rex reed once said of a movie julia and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through <UNK> juice i was reminded of that as i <UNK> through purple <UNK> this one appeared to be shot through <UNK> br br the story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time br br also everyone looked the same so it was hard to <UNK> among the characters i call this the dead <UNK> society syndrome br br there was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances br br a total disappointment
<START> after watching many of the next action star reality tv <UNK> <UNK> taped this <UNK> awful tripe for me for some bizarre reason and i only have myself to blame i watched the whole thing hoping that there would be something unique in the entire movie after so much hype about joel <UNK> <UNK> touch with action flicks he might want to make sure he bones up on his <UNK> br br first the only redeeming value of the entire film was billy zane and even he couldn't lift the <UNK> writing out of the <UNK> having said that <UNK> performance <UNK> about 2 <UNK> of the way through as he doesn't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug br br can't blame him here though the writing quite frankly sucked let's take ideas from rat race enemy of the state terminator midnight run and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it and who's brilliant idea was it to have two bridge chase sequences in a row br br sean <UNK> the man of the hour of the next action star shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series a one note johnny sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well but struggles with <UNK> the weight of the film quite frankly we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid way through as <UNK> fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him his dumb but lucky routine gets old as there really isn't anything about the character to root for br br but <UNK> is a dream compared to the wooden rigid <UNK> van <UNK> de <UNK> did howard fine really tell her to pretend to be a terminator for the first half of the film i don't think so i kept expecting her to quote arnie her character performance can be compared only to the dramatic depths of freddy got <UNK> though not nearly as well developed the camera loves her in dark shadowy <UNK> but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen <UNK> bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than <UNK> showed at any part of her screen time br br ultimately sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast but shouldn't have been left to do this one solo it was simply too big of a task for him next action star colleague jared elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization but it's hard to tell given jeff <UNK> lame script someone should take <UNK> <UNK> away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else and finally van <UNK> de <UNK> simply was <UNK> and way out of her reach even for complete <UNK> like this br br joel silver should be ashamed
<START> there are a lot of highly talented filmmakers actors in germany now none of them are associated with this movie br br why in the world do producers actually <UNK> money in something like this this you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage it's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as <UNK> pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the film's producer who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest dwarf br br the film is filled with moments that scream for <UNK> saying you're supposed to laugh now it's hard to believe that this <UNK> supposed to be a comedy br br many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my time br br pain
<START> following the success of the awful <UNK> island tv movie reruns a number of tv movies were made in the 1980's <UNK> casts from classic shows most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as <UNK> the humor that made the shows so special the <UNK> revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series <UNK> de <UNK> a wonderful <UNK> and essential to the series is completely wasted she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos what was the point of making them younger and <UNK> them with very little <UNK> they could have used butch patrick and pat priest although seeing some of the <UNK> spooky relatives was a nice touch i didn't enjoy sid <UNK> as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused <UNK> ironically that very year 1981 <UNK> old partner in comedy <UNK> <UNK> was also <UNK> cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly <UNK> another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the <UNK> family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family not famous monsters this was the last <UNK> project featuring the original cast in their roles there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's tv movie which featured <UNK> lewis priest and patrick in cameo roles as a family <UNK>
<START> someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen age <UNK> ended thirty years ago br br this is one of the worst films released in years an <UNK> disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark <UNK> in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been <UNK> at birth br br i hope john <UNK> got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this <UNK> mess more or less <UNK> his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
<START> i really enjoyed this episode which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired from a pure writing perspective 'the <UNK> <UNK> is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of sterling in particular i really enjoyed the philosophical <UNK> of the episode <UNK> themes of existence and reality whilst <UNK> it with more psychological topics such as denial pride and desire 'the sixteen <UNK> <UNK> is an episode about how these ideas based around an <UNK> to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever changing world it is also a fantastic example of cerebral twilight zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it these elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes br br the episode is not without its faults however which mainly lay in <UNK> and <UNK> shoes ironically i felt <UNK> was unconvincing throughout with only a few scenes that could count as memorable this of course being an absolute shame considering how well sterling had written her character furthermore <UNK> didn't seem to know what to do with most of his characters sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from <UNK> half the time thankfully <UNK> does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least br br as i said previously however if you're a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction this shouldn't be as bad as it's sometimes made out to be in addition to the writing that i mentioned above the episode also features some fantastic photography it still <UNK> me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later and decent enough set design overall 'the sixteen <UNK> <UNK> is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think
<START> anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be <UNK> forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about <UNK> quest to avenge his mother's death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents <UNK> journey from <UNK> to <UNK> the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated you can tell it's a 70's movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star <UNK> episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesn't matter a must see for any animation fan
<START> sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales aren't anything as good as any from the original <UNK> br br by far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating <UNK> makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty <UNK> tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down br br watch the original <UNK> instead or if you already have done then be happy with that
<START> a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on the real <UNK> tv series i said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well acted with wonderful characterizations br br i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna kathy nolan and tony <UNK> as another writer here mentioned it is curious that <UNK> reed <UNK> and michael <UNK> little luke weren't <UNK> to but perhaps they can be <UNK> down via <UNK> or <UNK> br br the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan <UNK> <UNK> the show in an unpleasant contract <UNK> which left luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called <UNK> about women <UNK> in the pacific in <UNK> ii get it <UNK> no not funny br br unlike the sleazy <UNK> and violent trash on tv now that is so <UNK> our values the real <UNK> entertained with decent values and fine human beings and i thank all involved including the creator irving <UNK> for having brought it to my family we never missed it
<START> the legend of zu as i saw it was a very interesting story i think many of the people who didn't like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the film they were expecting something akin to star wars and it was not that joseph campbell i believe would have liked this film there were a number of <UNK> and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked we all have a mountain of swords within us we all have to go into our own cave of blood sometime in our lives we all have to face our own insomnia someday granted some of the narration was a bit confusing and some of the action got a little hokey at times but i think other points of the film easily made up for it i'd watch it again br br i don't know if there's a difference between the legend of zu which i saw in <UNK> with english subtitles and zu warriors the dubbed usa version it might have been <UNK> down for american audiences which really would have <UNK> from this film
<START> with films like wallace <UNK> and chicken run under their belt the good people from the other side of the pond <UNK> animation are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of creature <UNK> br br derived from a short done early in their careers creature <UNK> is a slice of life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort br br <UNK> animation went across the country <UNK> people with <UNK> questions such as are you a liar and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives br br the answers while seeming to be boring and mundane are actually quite funny when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later br br how many of these animals look like the person making the statements one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman i like them kind of thin is an <UNK> the walking stick br br there are two dogs discussing <UNK> and <UNK> while <UNK> the behind of a <UNK> as they talk about the different <UNK> of a woman br br there are two birds in a cage as the wife tells the <UNK> that is her health her long suffering husband stands by her saying nothing br br while it might take some time for creature <UNK> to find it's legs it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary while there are more reality shows than carter has <UNK> <UNK> creature <UNK> is one of a kind and definitely worth watching br br some of the humor might seem a little <UNK> it's the <UNK> that catches the attention of the children like the old batman series of the 60's the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them and it's the jokes that are there for the adults
<START> for every series that makes it to television a 100 ideas are formed 50 scripts are written 15 pilots are made and one just one actually makes it to production from such a selection process we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series br br and so it goes with true blood all the stars were in <UNK> and what started as a series of novels was transformed into an idea a screen play a pilot and finally a series unfortunately it can sometimes be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that ultimately change what was good and pure into and show that production people feel would be best for ratings oh how wrong they so often are br br true blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the <UNK> story lines worst acting and <UNK> subplots as anything in recent television history its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices but keep <UNK> over their fake southern accents alan <UNK> not so secret desires for ryan jason <UNK> gives us a fresh nude shot each week although it often has nothing to do with the storyline <UNK> angry black woman characterization fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping the <UNK> take her out quickly before she goes into another speech about white <UNK> while attend a ceremony for the glorious dead of the <UNK> sam finds <UNK> love for <UNK> and suddenly we are to believe he needs to watch over her morning <UNK> and night despite years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship br br as for bill the vampire his moral high ground is quickly <UNK> at the first chance to make love with <UNK> and has no issue with make a quick <UNK> of her although she remains somewhat <UNK> we find the other vampires not so mainstream as bill but greatly <UNK> to become accepted by a public as they look at the living as happy <UNK> with legs br br despite my best efforts of suffering through the first six episodes i have come to the realization that no matter how long you watch a bad show its still bad somethings die for a reason even vampires maybe this show should to
<START> a very ordinary made for tv product <UNK> attempts to be a serious biopic while <UNK> the moments of angst for effect fast <UNK> through the <UNK> of the corrupt sport of boxing and <UNK> the <UNK> stuff which is the only thing which makes <UNK> even remotely interesting a <UNK> watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans
<START> this scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager now i find it more amusing than scary but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that i like and come to think of it the plot is rather disgusting actually but handled with some kind of taste if there is a problem with this movie it is that there are huge gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens also the ending goes on forever making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with barbara bach screaming and screaming the monster after it is exposed isn't very scary either unfortunately the somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it making it appear as a tv movie more than something made for theaters but it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so i urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic
<START> since september of last year i have been <UNK> four to six films each week from the harold washington library which boasts an impressive dvd collection the <UNK> truly is a <UNK> library three quarters of its films are out at any given time recently i was thrilled to find the short films of david lynch yesterday knowing little about the animated series i picked up <UNK> i'm here to report that for david lynch fans watching the eight episodes is half an hour well spent br br the most remarkable feature of these brief pieces are their <UNK> each episode has its own rhythm <UNK> and <UNK> systems provide <UNK> outrageous voices accent <UNK> ends physical violence supplies the beats <UNK> birds and <UNK> <UNK> brush along the edges many other elements fill out the orchestra the pacing of the crude animation often keeps in sync with the sound but the soundtrack itself struck me as lynch's primary interest in creating and <UNK> this work in a way these eight shorts are unique <UNK> <UNK> br br that said the situations are odd ugly profound dumb and funny as hell and there's enough space within them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be i can't say that i'll watch the collection again but for anyone who <UNK> in the movements that is the <UNK> <UNK> empire <UNK> is worth half an hour of your time
<START> or type on a computer keyboard they'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of 10 after all no elephants are shown being killed during the movie it is not even implied that any are hurt to the contrary the master of elephant walk john <UNK> peter <UNK> complains that he cannot shoot any of the <UNK> no matter how menacing without a <UNK> from the government and his tone suggests such <UNK> are not within the realm of <UNK> furthermore the elements <UNK> in the form of an unusual <UNK> and a human <UNK> <UNK> to leave the <UNK> plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people as the natives dub them to close the story if you happen to see the current release earth you'll <UNK> the elephant people are <UNK> less well today
<START> it was almost worth sitting through this entire god awful film just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again acting 0 script 0 fight scenes 0 male lead 0 <UNK> bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl <UNK> <UNK> 10 she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress this is the <UNK> i used to average it out to a two i lost count but i believe ever movie cliché ever is in this movie when the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her from out of nowhere it <UNK> the previous statement plus he just shows up for no reason he was never even mentioned before i don't know what else to say here just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years at least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials
<START> i've read reviews of <UNK> on imdb and frankly i've not seen one positive review until now i actually like <UNK> <UNK> is about a teenage boy named <UNK> lewis in order to make <UNK> 000 000 for his mother he sets up a website called <UNK> the website offers a lot of interesting things if only <UNK> and his 2 friends danny and seymour can stop <UNK> from getting exposed i find this show quite funny and i enjoy watching it the acting is o k but it can definitely be better the characters are funny especially danny <UNK> <UNK> friend his stupidity is what makes him funny and <UNK> other friend seymour also <UNK> the owner of the <UNK> called the chill we never see him we only hear him <UNK> younger brother omar and his older sister <UNK> is funny too and <UNK> best friend <UNK> so many times <UNK> has almost got exposed almost as well as the comedy the drama in <UNK> such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great
<START> <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her <UNK> <UNK> at this turn of events then <UNK> restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally 2 dimensional <UNK> is a self serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow <UNK> colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and <UNK> the underlying message of an over 50 woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film
<START> takashi miike's <UNK> into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements this is a fairy tale that <UNK> to be dark even as a kid i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most children's books miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance the filmmaker takes the <UNK> story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> the very real fears of a world filled with never ending <UNK> missions <UNK> like to <UNK> the seriousness behind <UNK> stories written specifically for kids i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers he goes for the <UNK> of the story but he also shows signs of <UNK> but a self possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers i thought it was a great film highly recommended
<START> i picked this up in the <UNK> after <UNK> box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore fest and with very bad dialogue which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way that sho gackt develops through the movie as a person the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good considering they aren't professional actors and the director did a marvelous job with it all setting it in the future minus the flying cars and <UNK> <UNK> br br on a side note <UNK> <UNK> performance was very surprising the only other film i've seen him in is battle <UNK> where he plays <UNK> <UNK> and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of <UNK> <UNK> is bright <UNK> and hyper serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics <UNK> was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it so watch out for his performance if you're familiar with battle <UNK> you'll be very surprised by him br br but don't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box because this isn't really a vampire movie it's just a movie with a vampire in it that <UNK> character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the <UNK> and you guys will love the last scene it's a really moving picture at some points the photography is really well done it's definitely something to pick up the next time you're at blockbuster
<START> i had high hopes for this film since it has charlton heston and jack palance but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so palance was ridiculous not even <UNK> acting or <UNK> <UNK> beauty or brief nude scenes could save this film some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy the plot was ludicrous even sci fi fans should skip this one grade f
<START> i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the 70's it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my <UNK> were with my family magical santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year br br if you have a child children and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus it's a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one way br br it's a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will <UNK> your eye and move your heart the shortcomings of the film's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than <UNK> for by the visual poetry of the story of young <UNK> heroic quest to become a master <UNK> during the dark ages historically this was in the late <UNK> century when the centers of irish learning were over run by the <UNK> the <UNK> appear here as <UNK> <UNK> the equivalent on the north <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> further east the film's narrative which functions more as a <UNK> centers around the conflict between brendan who seeks to create beauty in his <UNK> during a time of <UNK> darkness and his stern uncle the <UNK> who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a <UNK> wall as <UNK> against the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the value of <UNK> art in his quest for security this is the movie's outer conflict <UNK> inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative <UNK> which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells this eye is <UNK> by a dragon <UNK> who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the <UNK> will kill from without that's as much of the story as i'll <UNK> br br what i really like about this film is its <UNK> imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from <UNK> years ago the characters are stylized in flat abstract <UNK> defined by line just as in the original book of kells particularly noteworthy is monk <UNK> pet cat defined in few lines yet purely and even magically <UNK> <UNK> the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators the <UNK> borders on the edge of the picture change to <UNK> the dramatic impact of a given scene and this characteristic of <UNK> from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells of course historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas <UNK> to depict however by introducing <UNK> elements into this story the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a <UNK> sense of lived life from that far off time in ireland which feels psychologically true however much the script might stray from <UNK> historical fact the united <UNK> band of <UNK> who appear as a <UNK> club of artists in the secret of kells aren't historically <UNK> but they're all well designed <UNK> characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this <UNK> irish story animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly <UNK> from its historical visual source but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the dark ages the secret of kells is what it would look like finally <UNK> hero's quest in this film is the <UNK> <UNK> quest to convey the spirit of beauty life and inspiration without being preachy or even particularly christian this movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that man does not live by bread alone in my <UNK> the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a film about the great russian icon painter of the <UNK> century the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and <UNK> about the <UNK> visual quest and creative process it's certainly not as profound as <UNK> <UNK> but heck its a cartoon and one which will appeal to young and old alike i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life <UNK> way this stylized secret of kells is a classic
<START> very bad acting and a very shallow story not even a decent b movie br br events that were <UNK> to be shocking like humans <UNK> on board an alien ship were boring and very lame br br this is one of the worst sci fi i've ever seen i saw the 5 0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre but it sucked so bad br br now there's really very few good movies on alien subject i think because most of them are low budget br br i give it 3 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a charming yet extremely uneven <UNK> film that will delight some and bore others though reasonably well crafted the film lacks any real <UNK> relying instead on many scenes that will seem <UNK> to the <UNK> art house viewer the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance unfortunately they deserve a film worthy of their genius too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama <UNK> <UNK> will leave many views <UNK> and ultimately disgruntled you may laugh but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides a noble effort ultimately done in by lack of narrative <UNK>
<START> i respect the fact that this is a very popular show however in comparison with robert altman's ingenious hilarious zany and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic this show was probably destined to be less than mediocre even if it did run for 11 years that doesn't necessarily make it any good this show formed an all too integral part of my early childhood it was on re runs every night and guess whose parents were watching it and laughing it up but it's one of the memories i don't miss and now that i actually have seen the movie i can give this series an accurate critique on its own it's not nearly 2 out of 10 bad however the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie some of them technically are the same but they're only similar in name for instance since when is alan <UNK> anything like donald sutherland his style of humor is totally different as are his characterization and <UNK> the new characters are not that great they just serve to make you miss the ones that they're replacing it's the same with the new actors including jamie <UNK> the only thing that actually <UNK> to the series is radar who's still even though played by the same actor merely a pale imitation of the original what else oh yeah with a laugh track it didn't matter whether it was used in surgery scenes or not it comes across as creepy due to what's going on in the other settings and because it lasted nearly four times longer than the actual korean war it takes viewers into this bizarre <UNK> <UNK> that doesn't work outside the world of cartoons i've never liked this show and i never will
<START> dennis hopper is without a doubt one of the finest underrated american actors of our time and it was interesting to see how he would play out his role as a cop on the case of a child serial killer most movies hopper has always played to psychotic menace threatening to blow up stuff or go on a killing spree but in this movie hopper tried his best to keep that intensity and emotion while carrying a shield once i got into the plot of the movie i was hooked but it's just the little things that ultimately murdered the film br br the concept of the film is great not only are the cops on the move of catching the killer but we get a chance to see how the gangsters operate in catching the killer the subplot of the football stadium is kinda ridiculous but necessary to involve the gangsters in the killer hunt br br that's about all that is good you can say about the film although hopper did try to act like a tough experienced street smart cop i can't help but feel his acting was below par and there wasn't enough conviction that he was truly attached to the case the directing was also terrible it didn't have the feel of a true film but rather a tv movie production this is most evident when the gangsters meet for the first time to form an elite team to hunt the killer down when the leading gangster shoots the other <UNK> gangster in slow motion the acting was weak predictable and terribly <UNK> that's when i knew that 1st of all the action is going to be atrocious br br the <UNK> of the camera was amateurish and the <UNK> scenes or haunting images of the killer's little sister had no true distinctive effect if it was supposed to be scary it wasn't everyone's acting was terrible and even for hopper i didn't feel for his character and i just didn't really care too much about his relationship with his daughter br br the final thing that bothered me the most is the <UNK> team once i saw the <UNK> team in action i was thinking finally something good but i was wrong 1st of all the entire <UNK> team consisted of 4 guys that is just impossible 2nd of all apparently the <UNK> team has no training whatsoever because many times in the film they carry their <UNK> <UNK> guns with one hand had the killer been hiding near the <UNK> with a shotgun these 4 idiots would've been blown to bits because they weren't even aiming at anything or paying close attention they should have had both hands on the gun aiming forward but it just looks like they're not taking the job seriously and are just <UNK> around 3rd <UNK> team members do not yell out <UNK> such as keep your eyes open watch out for yourselves are we good to go etc in reality they use hand <UNK> or have <UNK> but they're literally yelling at each other how are you supposed to catch the killer when he can hear you're coming and to top it all off these guys have no plan apparently they're just running up and down going on a wild turkey chase eventually they end up doing nothing that was the last straw i'm no expert on special forces but basically what i've just <UNK> is pretty common sense when the audience knows the movie is terrible the action pretty much becomes the life <UNK> of the movie when you can't even make an effort to make the action great the movie is lost br br i give 2 stars for the concept but the rest cannot be credited if you want to watch a crime thriller don't bother with this one there's plenty of crime in the movie but it has the lack of thrill
<START> sure it's a 50's drive in special but don't let that fool you in my little book there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected <UNK> of humor catch the <UNK> mrs porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the <UNK> place she not only steals the scene but darn near the whole movie and where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color a wise decision since the blob would not show up well in b w yes the result is <UNK> around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate but except for several of the teens the non hollywood cast performs well then too the <UNK> among hot <UNK> and cops comes across as lively and entertaining pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a <UNK> than on a sound stage apparently they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with juvenile <UNK> then again the 27 year old mcqueen hardly qualifies in the age department but manages the hot <UNK> attitude anyway the movie was a hit at the time helped along no doubt by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play and except for the unfortunate final effects the movie is still a lot of fun drive in or no drive in meanwhile i'm awaiting the <UNK> return now that the polar <UNK> is turning into shall we say <UNK> water
<START> why does this movie fall well below standards ultimately the answer lies in the poor <UNK> script a slim average looking travolta looking rather <UNK> in black i must say even with a huge <UNK> and gross both act very well as two young ish <UNK> <UNK> but nevertheless <UNK> new <UNK> eager to open their own nightclub other than that the rest of the film is just boring to watch it is so dull that it's really not worth knowing what happens in the film's climax on any level kelly preston obviously exudes sex appeal and the sexually charged dance with her husband to be travolta is one of the film's few pleasures charles martin smith is quite fun to watch as struggling <UNK> <UNK> bob smith personally i think the movie would have been better if the plot was altered a little so that the settings did not change from ny to <UNK> springs <UNK> which is in the former soviet union you'll understand if you see the movie apparently this movie was filmed in 1986 ready for a 1987 release i guess paramount <UNK> on releasing the movie until january 1989 because of the unbelievable plot it was reported they deemed it <UNK> nevertheless this 6 000 000 film garnered a little over an embarrassing <UNK> 000 in <UNK> as it was released only briefly in places like texas and <UNK> before heading straight to video this is testament to the overall bad quality of this movie
<START> rival <UNK> pat morgan ginger rogers and ted <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are always trying to out scoop each other on stories the latest involves the mysterious death of a <UNK> who fell to his death after a <UNK> was heard from his <UNK> apartment the two <UNK> start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br this said to be follow up to the <UNK> guest has little to do with the earlier movie it is not a sequel as has been <UNK> ms rogers continues to develop her skills mr <UNK> adds a little humor to his characterization they are a pleasant team the plot is interesting and mysterious but the resulting film is very dull the opening and closing are startling a long <UNK> wrap up of plot development points follows the climax br br a <UNK> in the night 1933 albert ray ginger rogers <UNK> <UNK> harvey clark
<START> super mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created it is so <UNK> that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break i've beaten the game 4 times but i've never gotten all <UNK> stars i've gotten <UNK> but i hope to achieve them eventually even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in i loved watching my sisters play it now i am 13 and still play this <UNK> games and starting over again br br the graphics are unbelievable for an early <UNK> game the <UNK> is <UNK> the controls are great the levels are tough but not impossible the <UNK> fights are challenging br br i would like to tell you more but why don't you just get it for yourself put the x box <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> away and go find yourself a <UNK> 64 and play this amazing wonderful game
<START> this is my favorite of the older tom jerry cartoons from the early 40's the original version with <UNK> two shoes is on the tom jerry spotlight collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one aren't all <UNK> <UNK> style but more subtle and aimed at anyone who's ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to <UNK> him the nine lives gag is well done here and i don't know how many times i tried to make a <UNK> and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when <UNK> owner is <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> was not the maid it was her house she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready it's worth it
<START> this <UNK> melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring ingrid bergman that i've seen even her <UNK> screen presence can't save this <UNK> slow and meandering movie that's nearly impossible to sit through without fast <UNK> a lot of it br br only for die hard bergman fans others are very likely to fall asleep i suggest you to watch for whom the bell <UNK> instead
<START> this movie is light funny and beautifully filmed the lightning is absolutely superb and the colours convincingly remind <UNK> paintings br br this is sentimental comedy at its best way above us and french standards and arguably better than english ones too br br every character is touching and interpretation is close to perfection isabelle <UNK> is splendid <UNK> <UNK> is better than in the catherine series <UNK> <UNK> is charming <UNK> <UNK> is great in that weird role of his and <UNK> <UNK> is the perfect best friend br br i could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie so give it a chance and add your own review
<START> such great actors such a disappointment marlon brando plays and awful character the movie is not funny at all a <UNK> message can be seen it is a damn crap it <UNK> so badly throw your tv through window and so on it is simply disgusting and <UNK> in addition to foolish plot sense of humor there is something else the way the rooms are <UNK> the colors it makes me sick everything is so colourful that it might cause <UNK> usually i do not care about the decoration in movie but this from free money made me angry avoid at all costs free money probably for charlie sheen sutherland and brando but a viewer gets nothing one watches it at cost of sanity
<START> and that's why historic <UNK> movies are so important to all of us moreover when they are so well done like this one br br before i saw the young victoria i knew a few things about queen victoria but in the end i got much more knowledge about it br br emily blunt is simply great as victoria who would guess that and she probably will get a nomination at this years <UNK> personally i'm cheering for her br br for technical issues i am pleased to say that is a very successful production with wonderful art direction set decoration and of course like it was expected to be a terrific <UNK> costume design br br the one <UNK> is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen but foremost incredible woman and mother br br bravo 9 out of 10
<START> i remember watching american gothic when it first aired it came into my mind recently all i could remember was the same guy appeared in midnight <UNK> which is gary cole i don't watch much tv but i watched american gothic i purchased the complete series on dvd this week it's still as good as ever this is one of the best tv series ever the reason i don't watch much tv is because it's just rubbish that's on except for <UNK> brown it's all reality tv or <UNK> such as grease big brother etc i'm fed up with it i got the complete series of american gothic for <UNK> <UNK> form the <UNK> website that's the <UNK> i can find it
<START> saw this late one night on cable at the time i didn't know that the girl billed as shannon <UNK> was actually porn star <UNK> but she was so beautiful and got naked so often thank god that i actually sat through this brain rotting drivel i like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy more than the next guy actually but this was way beyond cheesy and more into <UNK> the truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's <UNK> and special effects people's virtually total incompetence <UNK> from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace <UNK> before she turned into the <UNK> <UNK> doll she became as a porn queen is really interesting to watch she's drop dead gorgeous bursts into <UNK> <UNK> at times <UNK> off camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time which is more than can be said for the audience for even though <UNK> and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked it still can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid badly made and annoying movie if you know someone who has it on video or if it comes on cable some night check it out but don't waste your money on a rental
<START> i only hope that no <UNK> ancient historians saw <UNK> or if they did that they took it as a laugh the movie is <UNK> inaccurate more laughably even than gladiator which is at least a well written script whose historical errors are <UNK> and <UNK> well to the story most blatant is <UNK> <UNK> heir in the <UNK> before <UNK> assassination at the <UNK> old age of 19 br br besides this the acting is mediocre timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> billy zane is a laughably dense marc <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> tries her best to be the seductive <UNK> who in real life was not good looking at all but comes off as unbelievable br br so this is a warning for all historians this movie is not true to life
<START> some unrealistic movie spoilers included br br from real life experiences this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning i'm currently <UNK> on my second tour to iraq as an <UNK> man this film has nothing near what would happen in real life <UNK> from the very start to name a few the bomb <UNK> the <UNK> elements rolling out solo with no <UNK> the <UNK> staff sergeant <UNK> of <UNK> having <UNK> rolled the entire time in <UNK> to where i had to call it <UNK> on my 2 dollar <UNK> copy the sniper scene the list would continue however it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect and the point was made br br this movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with <UNK> or the military br br people with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the <UNK>
<START> things to come movie review by <UNK> br br here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place it is a film i've only seen in <UNK> parts but art should be taken as a whole i experienced this film as it was designed in a <UNK> theatre on a silver screen with <UNK> <UNK> of film and an audience to share it with that audience and myself were <UNK> by this film one woman who lived through <UNK> ii was <UNK> up by the remembered <UNK> of war and <UNK> by the positive albeit corny ending br br the things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits the first thing we see is h g wells in bold <UNK> block copy much like the superman of <UNK> it is not the film title but the <UNK> title and then before any other humans such as actors or production are listed the director william cameron <UNK> is up there who you've probably seen his work before around the world in 80 days pride of the <UNK> and gone with the wind he did not direct after this sci fi epic opera he and mr wells created but his film imagery sets and design are very recognizable br br that imagery is very <UNK> i recognized images from many other films that have paid homage to this classic the recent <UNK> guide to the galaxy is obvious along with bugs bunny <UNK> monty python and the holy grail sky captain the world of tomorrow night of the living dead and more that i know of but which titles escape me this is real special effects here scenes now done with cgi are done with actors big sets and detailed models this film was made in 1936 and it's obvious it meant something to the other <UNK> wells and <UNK> also worked with bliss doing the music and <UNK> the producer to create a masterpiece with message warning and <UNK> br br the lines the shakespearean actors cedric <UNK> ralph richardson and raymond massey speak sometimes sound preachy but i also heard lines i still hear now these toys children have nowadays are nothing like i had when i was child it'll help develop their <UNK> what do we need books for what do we need to read for we don't need cars there's nowhere to go we have all we need right here there will be no war but war there is the naive citizens of <UNK> refuse to see the literal writing on the wall the never ending war explodes christmas eve the little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me this is the world of 1936 that wore <UNK> to hitler's <UNK> this war does not end the poison gas of the <UNK> wars <UNK> into the second act br br it is another dark age no government no services and people carried along and cheering the war that no one remembers anything about plague <UNK> and bullying to get the planes flying for fuel that no longer exists loved ones are shot in the street before they can carry the plague to another <UNK> there is a marvelous <UNK> about the rolls <UNK> that is a much needed <UNK> mid way into this lands a futuristic plane that <UNK> the future br br that future is the third act the world has <UNK> itself with the help of that <UNK> animal man <UNK> fly in this film before they were even invented the <UNK> <UNK> has other uses than the <UNK> or glenn <UNK> wide screen <UNK> screens <UNK> the masses and <UNK> <UNK> the people to tear it all down beware the <UNK> you have been warned the city father warns the <UNK> <UNK> so be warned this film might hit you like it hit me there are some cute <UNK> and <UNK> but the thought provoking <UNK> is what is really worth <UNK> again and i do want to see this <UNK> film again others criticize mr wells vision it is very easy to work with 20 20 <UNK> regarding things costumes and <UNK> <UNK> i believe mr <UNK> things to come is not about things but is actually about concepts social <UNK> and philosophical ideals besides we are now just beginning the new millennium and are not in the time still to come this is not cheap cardboard british science fiction but worthwhile epic filmed opera sans singing that as a whole concept <UNK> some minor dated shortcomings
<START> ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected he did a fabulous job acting as a <UNK> cop within a <UNK> department from the very beginning he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the <UNK> he's in he acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job he was quite clearly the best character in the movie br br this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards after starring in <UNK> films like the <UNK> redemption this film was certainly a step down his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the <UNK> of characters placed him sadly on a back <UNK> there are so many ways his character <UNK> <UNK> could have taken a more pivotal role that he didn't was disappointing and a true let down i was hoping to see more from him in this film br br timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and <UNK> this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past being an action movie it has its share of shoot em up scenes blood and guts these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a good cops bad cops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a real police shoot out br br what <UNK> me most was the way <UNK> character <UNK> during shoot out scenes he starts out having guns and not using them then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he's been firing a gun his whole life then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun and 30 seconds later without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra <UNK> little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me br br if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay then you'll probably love this movie personally it doesn't matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic make me believe that the story is true this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling <UNK>
<START> everyone involved and the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been what happened the south american story what were julie christie and kate <UNK> thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut outs up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance and or movie he was either <UNK> which i can hardly believe or dreadfully miscast i have also liked and <UNK> richard gere and been <UNK> for it but here he had no power he was never <UNK> and only occasionally <UNK> all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast if you can't find the candidate watch <UNK> the dog again or even <UNK>
<START> this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this anyway br br unless you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called <UNK> fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are <UNK> the bottom of the barrel with this one
<START> i think that can sum up this show about as well as anything batman <UNK> may be the worst thing to ever happen to cartoons based on comic books because everything that comes after will be compared to it and nothing has <UNK> up yet it's just too damn good was batman beyond good yeah but it was no <UNK> is justice league good it's not too bad but it's no <UNK> br br the batman is certainly no <UNK> either but i won't hold that against it it would be unfair and besides it has plenty of other problems with it br br the concept of a younger less experienced batman fighting crime is a fine one and at times the art is very nice but all of the rest of the time the art is worthless <UNK> and this betrays a lot of the flaws of the show itself it is paced written and designed like an <UNK> if i wanted to watch jackie chan adventures i'd watch jackie chan adventures or i could just bang my head into a wall any time and get the same effect the joker is a homicidal mentally unstable clown in a suit who uses his wits <UNK> and clever <UNK> to fight batman when he is forced to fight hand to hand he will either resort to something cheap or be totally <UNK> he is not meant to be a monkey with <UNK> who knows kung fu and can leap into twenty feet into the air accompanied by speed lines if they had wanted to do that with a villain there were other less important characters they could have used or gasp they could have created a new one entirely and it's not that re <UNK> are a bad thing don't get me wrong <UNK> there i go again took mr freeze from your standard <UNK> wielding b villain and made him into a memorable and morally complex character of course freeze wasn't exactly a classic villain at the time and they performed an <UNK> but the point stands what the batman does is it takes everything you liked about batman comics and <UNK> and takes a large <UNK> dump on them guess what they were eating corn br br it's obvious this show can't stand against <UNK> but stand it on its own legs and it still doesn't work for me the plots aren't good and they don't develop any better they've been written for the <UNK> of children under twelve should children be able to enjoy a show of course they should this shouldn't be an adult show with swearing nudity and gratuitous violence but the mark of a truly good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels by all ages this show misses that mark br br is this show a <UNK> no of course not the problem is it's not even a <UNK>
<START> maybe some people may consider this a slow movie however it's precisely this slow burning that allows it to profoundly affect the viewer like that marvelous first scene first we can hear the voices then we are allowed to see the characters finally the camera slowly pans back and to the side and we see another character a young man who is just sitting there apparently not even listening to the conversation or at least not really caring the fact that this young man will be the leading role shows the movie's <UNK> allowing the character to develop and be determined by the environment surrounding him but without <UNK> the points more than necessary people come and go flow in and out of his life although most of the movie follows him and most of the supporting characters are only seen when close to him defined according to the relationship <UNK> with him we are induced to believe that we are being objective so subtle is the director touch
<START> heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux <UNK> it's desperate to teach us a <UNK> lesson and it won't stop until we've passed the final <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and molly take a trip to washington where they see the <UNK> in action or <UNK> if you prefer have a <UNK> with their senator eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career get <UNK> with a <UNK> of annoying stereotypical <UNK> children and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace henry wallace a year later he was considered a near communist <UNK> but in 1944 he was a ok add in some truly awful musical moments a whole lot of <UNK> <UNK> and a boring subplot about newspaper <UNK> and you've got a film that must have had philip <UNK> ready to pen generation of <UNK> 2 d c <UNK> drastically <UNK> heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes
<START> this is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from brian de <UNK> amazing performances all around it's extremely suspenseful and often scary and the score is fantastic plus all the characters were awesome yes it rips off psycho a lot however it's still a brilliantly made horror thriller with a fantastic opening and a shocking and unpredictable finale this is <UNK> one of the best horror thrillers i have ever seen and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes ever plus michael caine is simply amazing in this the ending is excellent and the hospital scene near the end is absolutely terrifying plus the end twist shocked the hell out of me it never failed to creep me out and the stalk sequences are absolutely brilliant plus nancy allen and keith gordon had fantastic chemistry together this is a taut suspenseful masterpiece from brian de palma with amazing performances all around the direction is incredible brian de palma does an incredible job here with amazing camera work incredible angles fantastic use of colors awesome zoom <UNK> and zoom <UNK> great <UNK> shots and keeping the film at a very very fast pace there is a bit of blood we get bloody <UNK> <UNK> bloody <UNK> wounds and 2 bloody <UNK> throats the acting is amazing michael caine is amazing here he is amazing in the acting department creepy is very likable was mysterious and really just did an amazing job overall i loved him caine rules angie dickinson gives a memorable performance here and was quite beautiful and had good chemistry with caine nancy allen is stunningly gorgeous and is fantastic here she is extremely likable as the hooker had excellent chemistry with keith gordon and put on a tremendous show keith gordon is very good as the kid he had excellent chemistry with nancy allen and was very likable dennis <UNK> is good as the detective overall this is <UNK> one of the best horror films ever made and i say drop what your doing immediately and go see it out of 5
<START> this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly <UNK> in its day a wealthy upper class english woman schemes plots and <UNK> everyone around her for her own satisfaction she uses her <UNK> position to <UNK> on secret activities of a decidedly anti social kind there's a clever sex role <UNK> as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters but naturally there's a tall dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest and this wicked lady is not <UNK> in coming forward when she meets the right man br br the <UNK> <UNK> weakness and <UNK> of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme but those who <UNK> for romance will overlook that
<START> hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest though the audience sees he is a werewolf the hunters never seem to realize this because after they shoot him he looks normal when they <UNK> him br br a doctor <UNK> the <UNK> eyes into a man who lost his own in a laboratory experiment the man rich gets to have sex with his nurse stephanie <UNK> before he even gets his <UNK> removed br br after he leaves the hospital he finds his wife has been cheating on him too when a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon with a fake tree branch on the <UNK> he turns into a werewolf his <UNK> grows larger splitting his shirt and he grows a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in the eyes his pants stay intact the mouth <UNK> <UNK> though some sort of <UNK> or hidden hands in the <UNK> give him a <UNK> look at times br br despite the poor werewolf costume there is a fair amount of blood and gore and those are fairly well done there's even a pretty good <UNK> later in the movie however when a man falls from a height a rather bad <UNK> does the job br br rich has a friend named <UNK> who is some sort of occult expert and he also accidentally stumbles across a small man with <UNK> named <UNK> who is also such an expert they try to help him a little br br rich kills people who have done him wrong a <UNK> <UNK> the murders and tries to hit on <UNK> who doesn't much care for lesbian scenes so nothing comes of it br br quite cheap but between the nudity and blood and gore and a not terrible story combining sort of the most dangerous game with the hands of <UNK> and the wolf man it's somewhat entertaining available on its own or in the box set scream queens <UNK> 1
<START> having enjoyed jean arthur in the devil and miss jones my interest was <UNK> so i tried sitting through this second string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a <UNK> but i didn't make it to the end arthur photographed in a <UNK> movie magazine fashion either wants <UNK> from ex husband william powell or another shot at marriage but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of <UNK> she's the type of heroine prone to comical <UNK> but once inside a <UNK> like all women in these <UNK> comedies she <UNK> william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur but you'd never know it from the end result they look awkward standing next to each other <UNK> over their banter the actor playing <UNK> <UNK> is excruciating and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with <UNK>
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen for years it starts <UNK> and continues in the same way i <UNK> when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop mark <UNK> is a bad actor in a bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks
<START> i came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a national <UNK> documentary meets columbia <UNK> ad br br the film begins with brian jared <UNK> preparing for a journey by plane to see his father his mother <UNK> gives him the curious choice of a <UNK> as a going away gift what's wrong with a <UNK> cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it once in the air the <UNK> pilot a blink and you'll miss him cameo by ned beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually <UNK> brian must find shelter food and hope for rescue br br here is where the main problem with the movie begins by the very nature of <UNK> <UNK> jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have <UNK> by <UNK> up the tension of each scene instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger as a result too much <UNK> is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension these scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story even worse occasionally jared  his face covered with mud lets out a primal scream or two which <UNK> up unfortunate parallels to predator ' speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being <UNK> the sight of his <UNK> but it presumably helped keep him warm at night br br another disappointment is pamela sue martin in a totally <UNK> performance as the mother both she and the father have very little impact in the movie for instance we are never shown how they react to news of <UNK> disappearance how they might be <UNK> rescue attempts and so on this is just one source of tension the film makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before brian <UNK> on his journey
<START> <UNK> directed any way the wind blows as he would sing a <UNK> song <UNK> rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts the story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows and that can truly be refreshing to watch if you are prepared and willing that is viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story lines together are right who the hell is that <UNK> anyway still i really enjoyed this movie <UNK> is a beautiful <UNK> happening place and any way captures that feeling it also captures the silliness the racism the <UNK> the <UNK> and the violence that survives <UNK> in a seemingly friendly city the movie is entertaining funny and a little shallow <UNK> screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut in that light some might be disappointed but then again <UNK> case <UNK> would be a subtle <UNK> for any way the wind blows
<START> this one came out during the western <UNK> last gasp unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether <UNK> effort â even if made by and with veterans in the field to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there â charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn <UNK> heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara <UNK> naturally the former <UNK> â accompanied by <UNK> <UNK> fiancÃ© chris mitchum â sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with him br br rather than handling the proceedings in his <UNK> sub <UNK> style mclaglen goes for a sam <UNK> approach â with which <UNK> never fully at ease <UNK> characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by <UNK> presence among <UNK> <UNK> bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam <UNK> western â the troubled major <UNK> 1965 i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan and <UNK> format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to <UNK> the <UNK> mood it clearly <UNK> for suggested also by the title then again both stars had already paid a fitting <UNK> to this most american of genres â will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat <UNK> billy the kid 1973 br br at least though heston maintains a <UNK> of dignity here â his <UNK> character attempting to stay ahead of half breed coburn by <UNK> what his next move will be the latter however <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> role and only really comes into his own at the climax <UNK> his moment of vengeance by <UNK> forcing heston to witness his <UNK> gang rape of <UNK> apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el <UNK> <UNK> the villainous gang is then trapped inside a <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> heston and the violent death of the two <UNK> protagonists as was his fashion <UNK> demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice br br the supporting cast includes michael parks as the <UNK> town sheriff <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> mexican lieutenant and larry <UNK> â of the tv series <UNK> â as the youngest member of <UNK> gang <UNK> assigned the task of watching over <UNK> while doing his best to keep his <UNK> mates away jerry <UNK> contributes a <UNK> but at the same time <UNK> score
<START> may contain spoilers br br if living on tokyo time were some bold experiment where real life wanna be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful <UNK> anti anxiety anti depression and anti psychotic <UNK> this is the classic <UNK> ward <UNK> that <UNK> patients into <UNK> zombies all during filming then this movie would hold far more interest or if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep <UNK> before and during filming then tokyo time could be more easily explained br br as it is this film is filled with lifeless low energy actors in the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open in almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body <UNK> from beginning to end his facial expression is best described as near sleep br br <UNK> not about the actors speaking over each other's lines because these actors can barely finish <UNK> out any lines of dialog everyone speaks with a depressing <UNK> voice no laughing no yelling no <UNK> no one has energy enough to crack a smile the result complete and total boredom br br and it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish br br avoid this lifeless film at all costs better to watch <UNK> which has a similar plot and has charm and energy or for an unconventional japanese romance story check out the long vacation which has an ample amount of everything living on tokyo time does not
<START> yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material but then it doesn't try to be anything it is not a fun filled romp with real funny one liners a stellar and very funny performance by peter o'toole a <UNK> and down to earth performance from joan <UNK> the <UNK> performance was on the spot each one playing their role in a <UNK> comical manner the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely from some of the negative comments i <UNK> that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads a good example is the comment about the strange baseball like game well my dear american that was <UNK> from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know <UNK> also no you were not supposed to <UNK> when carl broke a window it was funny how lord <UNK> said oh yes to get more money for <UNK> and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money <UNK> it seems that every joke must be explained to some people all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs well worth seeing
<START> i am a jane eyre lover and a <UNK> and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book and the characters are portrayed as i imagined them jane eyre is a complex story of great <UNK> and can't be delivered properly in a feature length format so it needs a tv mini series timothy <UNK> rochester is probably the best ever there has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age in the book jane the narrator describes him as about 35 and not young but not yet middle aged i think timothy dalton was about <UNK> when he made this so that is about right also we only have jane's opinion of whether rochester is handsome she only just met him and he asks her <UNK> what she thinks as an inexperienced and humble girl i can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man and this is <UNK> to perfection i love the relationship between the two leads which is the crucial thing about this story and the humour of their encounters other versions have blown it but this gets it right the 2006 version with toby <UNK> aged <UNK> years is in progress on <UNK> and is very good indeed so i will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed br br on viewing this series again after watching the 2006 version i have decided that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best charlotte <UNK> dialogue is <UNK> and this is essential to the power of the story <UNK> just doesn't work it's a victorian story and having <UNK> poetic speech suits the characters this version has an excellent cast zelah clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and rochester is important timothy dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor there are no extra scenes to <UNK> from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes but leaves out unnecessary details making it to the point and gripping i recommend it to all true jane eyre fans
<START> there's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department yet it more than entertained for what it was and i can't deny i enjoyed it immensely br br azumi 2 lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful the first thing that should set alarm <UNK> <UNK> is the absence of the superb <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> with him he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and <UNK> but the originals style beauty and most importantly its heart while the first had a simple <UNK> plot this one has a <UNK> mess of a story with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is <UNK> gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters azumi and her <UNK> are often reduced to a bunch of <UNK> teenagers arguing in a forest characterisation is non existent if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies i'll be shocked the same applies to the villains here the final battle in fact all the battles are completely devoid of any sort of tension the fact that they are poorly choreographed and <UNK> directed not to mention few and far between is made a <UNK> by their own sheer <UNK> the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy and even if they were all combined they don't come within a country mile of the pete <UNK> antics of jo <UNK> in the original br br major spoiler at end of paragraph br br <UNK> <UNK> tries her best it has to be said and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films azumi is now a fully <UNK> assassin meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion unfortunately now the character is <UNK> with a sort of man with no name style <UNK> <UNK> model looks become even more inappropriate i know this is supposed to be the point but this combined with the <UNK> of everyone else in the film the stupidity of the plot and the general <UNK> of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around the less said about <UNK> remember me from kill bill <UNK> performance the better it <UNK> to say her turn from good to evil is about as subtle as <UNK> br br overall this was just a <UNK> disappointment any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film a lazy unsatisfying and generally downright boring mess
<START> every new fall line up show deserves at least my 3 strikes and you're out policy i give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh that is 3 complete episodes after episode 1 i actually said to the tv cancelled tomorrow it was that bad i have now watched the first 4 episodes of <UNK> and have yet to manage even a <UNK> not a <UNK> a <UNK> a <UNK> as a matter of fact no facial movement at all i will continue to <UNK> myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show i'm simply not getting it but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in prime time just has to be funny but there are no laughs from me yet there's just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8 00 p m i know there has got to be an inside joke that just isn't <UNK> with my brain i've read each of the previous comments i get the social aspect of it but where are the jokes i shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week until i have a light <UNK> moment and <UNK> myself in the head shouting <UNK>
<START> this film opened to poor <UNK> in the first few weeks then <UNK> <UNK> died and it just brought the crowds rolling in songs on all india radio especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were played so often that i was sick of them at the time despite <UNK> their beauty br br yes it did take all those years to make this was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and kamal <UNK> also had difficulty finding the money to make the film looking at the <UNK> sets and costumes not surprising not only does <UNK> <UNK> age and fall ill but listen carefully to <UNK> voice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has her 50's younger voice while songs that were re recorded like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> show clear development i only wish someone would find the <UNK> <UNK> songs that weren't included in the film because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and <UNK> them <UNK> in a recent interview 2007 rated <UNK> <UNK> as one of the best <UNK> she had ever worked with apart from <UNK> <UNK> a great personal friend notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the <UNK> <UNK> songs very unusual there is only a brief shot of raj kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed <UNK> <UNK> kamal <UNK> made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon any other film this song would have had close ups of both of them br br as for this being the finest film ever i would beg to <UNK> it means you have missed a lot of indian cinema in no particular order films like <UNK> old <UNK> older versions <UNK> do <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> guide <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> etc etc and if you <UNK> music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> joker the list is really endless br br so enjoy <UNK> but don't miss out on any of the above
<START> i have seen slaughter high several times over the years and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor but i never knew that it was filmed in the uk and i never knew that the actor that plays marty <UNK> simon <UNK> committed suicide after the film was released i guess i did notice while watching it last night that the actors <UNK> seems rather odd for americans and a few of them aren't very good at hiding their english accents br br all that aside though this is the tale of the class nerd marty who is the butt of jokes from his classmates and on one particular day april fools day he's <UNK> into the girl's locker room by one caroline <UNK> yes playing a teenager and <UNK> big time on film of course the coach catches the gang at work they're all given a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> them but not before a couple of the guys slip marty a joint which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab but it's full of something that makes him sick when he runs to the <UNK> one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that <UNK> with something marty is mixing which results in a fire and the <UNK> of a bottle of <UNK> acid which leaves poor marty burned horribly <UNK> br br ten years later this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old <UNK> high which seems oddly <UNK> up and <UNK> but thanks to <UNK> they manage to get in and find the place seemingly <UNK> except there's a room where a <UNK> and <UNK> is laid out and so of course they eat drink and be merry for soon they will die of course br br the gang is stalked one by one by a figure in a <UNK> mask but could it be marty they don't know they figure he's either in a loony bin or working for <UNK> they're not sure which but whoever it is he's making quick work of them particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose <UNK> popped all over her when he <UNK> <UNK> beer she is victim to an acid bath which i believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version because it seemed extra nasty when i watched it this time i could be wrong but i believe that wasn't on the tape br br at any rate there's somewhat of a twist ending and that also contains footage not on the tape i believe there's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also <UNK> but apart from that i didn't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version probably so but it's been a while since i've last seen it br br at any rate if you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release dvd because it's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere feel to it 7 out of 10
<START> buffs of the adult western that <UNK> in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome of course we can go back to howard <UNK> red river 1948 or further still to john ford's my darling <UNK> 1946 but if we want to stick with this single decade then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that <UNK> initial year one is the <UNK> an <UNK> grim tale of a famed <UNK> <UNK> facing his last shootout another from that same year is winchester '73 and it's worth noting that <UNK> mitchell appears in both as grim <UNK> highly realistic range riders in the <UNK> he's the town <UNK> expected to arrest <UNK> but once <UNK> with him in an outlaw gang in winchester he's the sidekick to jimmy stewart a kind of <UNK> to stewart's hamlet in this epic tragic tale the plot is simple enough stewart's <UNK> <UNK> wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match beating the <UNK> man in the west stephen <UNK> who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father when the brother steals the gun stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier meeting up with both <UNK> and indians in one wonderful bit two future stars rock hudson and tony curtis play an indian chief and a u s <UNK> soldier during a well staged pitched battle dan duryea steals the whole show as a <UNK> outlaw leader while <UNK> winters just before she began to gain weight is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together today filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen but anthony mann does so in an extremely <UNK> amount of time with not a minute wasted such western legends as bat masterson and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by will <UNK> make brief appearances adding to the <UNK> as well as the epic nature the final battle between good and bad brothers high <UNK> a series of <UNK> rock <UNK> is now legendary among western buffs it's also worth noting that stewart however much associated he became with western films does what is actually his first western leading man role here yes he was in <UNK> rides again eleven years earlier but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns
<START> this is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion the characters are <UNK> obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish <UNK> br br william <UNK> so sad to see him in this role was <UNK> when this film was made but he's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s kay <UNK> was 20 and was scripted to find him <UNK> attractive i think the dog they found by the side of the road was <UNK> and had more life than their erotic connection br br <UNK> character the same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film not <UNK> is placed with obvious <UNK> of 60s pre hippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hi fi the <UNK> at <UNK> but the film is ridiculously <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> of old <UNK> desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big <UNK> cars sexy br br ugh youth culture was never that desperate and i <UNK> to think that bill <UNK> was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part
<START> this was probably one of the most well made films of the 40's warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by <UNK> <UNK> is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate <UNK> max <UNK> contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical <UNK> <UNK> method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable it's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won <UNK> and awards and went down as a historical favorite <UNK> because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all <UNK> and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper critical perfection each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints i've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if you're hungry for a perfect <UNK> <UNK> don't go to the <UNK> counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff <UNK> the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots you'd all be <UNK> <UNK> i'll take an old movie without modern intellectual <UNK> an day of the week
<START> if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill <UNK> you don't need billy burke <UNK> or any other <UNK> massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling <UNK> on the script my <UNK> vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to <UNK> a veteran cast with a good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime i wanted to like it but the shallow script <UNK> the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with <UNK>
<START> as a child i always hated being forced to sit through musicals i never understood why people would break out into song like that and i was far too young to appreciate the artistry choreography set design costumes pacing behind it all carol <UNK> oliver was the one musical i remember oddly enjoying as a child probably because it is one of the darker ones and is appropriately <UNK> in the spirit of <UNK> <UNK> this is a musical about ghetto life in victorian london and while the scenery and set designs are stark dark and true to that way of life it is flat out bizarre for people to be breaking out into such ridiculous songs amidst their misery upon a recent viewing my first since childhood i have some new thoughts and insights into why this musical works in that bizarre breaking out into song kind of way and why most just don't do it for me br br when musicals work or really say something it is because they realize their own inherent <UNK> lars von <UNK> dancer in the dark as tragic and operatic and over reaching as it was worked as a musical because the musical numbers were the products of the imagination of the protagonist an immigrant obsessed with hollywood musicals likewise the very cynical and enjoyable chicago worked on a similar level because the musical numbers were the products of a homicidal <UNK> singer dancer musicals don't work when they take their own musical nature too seriously like in <UNK> <UNK> or are simply too much fluff about nothing i e something pointless like mary <UNK> upon viewing oliver for the first time as an adult i saw it in a new light told mostly from the point of view young oliver i saw the musical numbers as the products of his childhood imagination and his way of <UNK> with the horrors of ghetto life around him the best musical number was probably when nancy got everyone in the <UNK> <UNK> and dancing about the <UNK> of getting drunk as a cover to help poor oliver escape the <UNK> of the evil bill sykes it was undeniably catchy and sounded like a real pub tune that <UNK> might start singing around a piano there are other great and classic tunes to be heard here and the direction and acting from the leads to the dancing extras are all top notch br br still for all its <UNK> although it does have a happy ending for oliver at least though certainly things didn't end happily for nancy and unless you think a life on the streets being a pick pocket is fun it wasn't a necessarily a good ending for fagin or the <UNK> despite their <UNK> closing tune i wouldn't really <UNK> this as a family film though i don't think showing it to kids over the age of seven or eight will do any harm this is a harsh tale about an unfortunate orphan trying to survive on the streets and find some happiness i think it would be very interesting to see a modern update on this some how perhaps a <UNK> take on it where people on the streets of <UNK> break into happy songs about their horrible lives i'd like to see a hard edged hip hop version of oliver i always thought dickens would translate well in those regards as it stands oliver was probably the last of the great film musicals and maybe the strangest g rated film i've ever seen
<START> with the mixed reviews this got i wasn't expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised it's a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing that's <UNK> without being <UNK> and a good pace it looks good too in a funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and i'm one who liked it
<START> quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well what is it what is it about will smith that i just can't stand any longer i guess he just seems too <UNK> on being taken seriously and <UNK> an oscar i understand how bias this is but unless he <UNK> some new acting lessons i can't ever see him winning one he's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor he's just not i give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry at the drop of a hat that's about it br br seven pounds was kind of an <UNK> for me right from the start the suicide <UNK> call didn't intrigue me in any way i wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide there were absolutely no surprises the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry also i don't know her name but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife woody <UNK> had very limited screen time but i'd say he stole the show whenever he was on br br all in all just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot i couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people never once felt sorry for <UNK> <UNK> he killed himself with a <UNK> was the only survivor in an 8 person accident <UNK> didn't see any of that coming br br 5 10 is pretty generous
<START> the same night that i watched this i also watched scary movie 4 making for one messed up double feature unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid brutally dated and brutally bad the more recent parody had me laughing out loud how could i desire any more than that director john de <UNK> uses the basic premise that some sort of growth <UNK> has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day the script <UNK> of <UNK> humor and perhaps if you take illegal <UNK> with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea i sober was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a <UNK> and that one joke that is never funny where the <UNK> between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here some may giggle i did not they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny and i thought all hitler jokes were funny br br the narrative of this film is so <UNK> for no good reason that it is nearly impossible to explain tomatoes kill people the government tries to stop it bad jokes are told their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media <UNK> and paranoia three things that still control our lives today oddly enough the main selling point of this film those gosh darn tomatoes really don't make much of an appearance and when they do get this they're played by real tomatoes that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes <UNK> a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that <UNK> this film from being truly funny the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members but more than likely it will be seen as an <UNK> to join in the fun br br i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human <UNK> at work here man eats <UNK> and that's dinner <UNK> eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe but that is just the way the world works in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic <UNK> but in the real world our produce see <UNK> bell becomes evil thanks to neglect and like those evil <UNK> green <UNK> this film's shelf life <UNK> a long time ago there are a few good chuckles to be had the last shot was really quite splendid but it was nowhere near enough to save this <UNK> stink bomb i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept but the script needed to be <UNK> through about a dozen <UNK> to get there and by there i mean to the level of scary movie 4 1 4
<START> no fireworks despite violent action br br science fiction films that reflect quality are <UNK> indeed largely because <UNK> of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of <UNK> funding or <UNK> invention and unfortunately for its producers this work is lacking on both counts woefully so in the case of the latter with essentially no budget with which to operate it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and in particular special effects of space opera <UNK> which appear only <UNK> while <UNK> from the <UNK> imagination lie <UNK> due to some of the most <UNK> <UNK> of basic scientific principles to be found among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment and a <UNK> law of gravity which <UNK> freedom of movement of cast members while <UNK> objects <UNK> <UNK> but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in <UNK> the plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station <UNK> colony to a waste <UNK> upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to earth with some few capable players present who are <UNK> directed by first <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose production team wastes effort upon such as <UNK> pornography while ignoring a <UNK> and basic <UNK> for the creation of states of suspense and of <UNK> br br
<START> a prequel to the re imagined battlestar galactica series from the same creative team ronald d moore and david <UNK> as well as new series co creator <UNK> <UNK> caprica is set in the twelve <UNK> some <UNK> years prior to the events of battlestar galactica the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the <UNK> race br br the pilot and the series are set to follow two families the <UNK> which include daniel eric <UNK> a computer genius and corporate <UNK> and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while the <UNK> include joseph <UNK> <UNK> a lawyer and his son william the future <UNK> of battlestar galactica br br like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br for fans of battlestar <UNK> there are similarities and <UNK> with that series but it is also very different in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series the scenes on caprica while <UNK> a more <UNK> advanced society also have retro feel this is achieved through some of the architecture the costumes and the way it is shot br br while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar religion is again very important here while the racial theme rarely touched on in <UNK> is far more important we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one as well as issues related to crime and government br br the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and <UNK> version prior to airing on tv the series is set to start in <UNK> br br like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in <UNK>
<START> upon the straight story release in 1999 it was praised for being david lynch's first film that ignored his regular themes of the macabre and the surreal based on a true story of one man and his journey to visit his estranged brother on a john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at first glance its an odd story for lynch to direct yet as the story develops you can see some of lynch's trademark <UNK> coming through br br lynch's focus on small town america and its inhabitants is still as prevalent as in his previous efforts such as blue <UNK> or twin peaks but the most notable difference is that the weirdness is <UNK> down the <UNK> <UNK> means that the film has the notable <UNK> of being one of the few live action films that i can think of that features a g rating incredibly significant this films stands as evidence that beautiful and significant family films can be produced br br the straight story was the first feature which lynch directed where he had no hand at writing for many lynch <UNK> this was a huge negative point almost universally acclaimed the only overly negative review by james <UNK> of <UNK> com focused on this very criticism that it wasn't a typical lynch film lynch is struggling within the mold of a g rated story that isn't his own <UNK> claims with his protagonist alvin straight <UNK> lines directly from <UNK> he <UNK> that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of <UNK> lost highway or <UNK> drive all films which i also adore the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible if you are a lynch fan it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature br br the narrative is slow and thoughtful which gives you a real sense of the <UNK> thoughts as he travels to his destination alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife children and his brother yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks which only adds to the effect which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch the natural landscapes of the us are <UNK> and together with the beautiful soundtrack by <UNK> <UNK> makes me <UNK> to go to america the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn't win regardless however it is probably the finest <UNK> song for any actor br br so whilst the straight story features none of lynch's complex <UNK> or trademark dialogue the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended
<START> i went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film i was still <UNK> disappointed i actually cant believe i spent <UNK> minutes of my life watching this film it was that bad the storyline was <UNK> and the acting was terrible even though it had big names such as uma thurman in it this film heavily relied on its special effects but they personally had no effect on me i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards my advice is to save your money go shopping treat yourself just don't go and see this film you'll live to regret it lol
<START> the cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man vs woman argue all the time but wind up in love type of hollywood screwball romance comedy br br i usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing fun to watch and <UNK> with charm br br jimmy stewart and margaret <UNK> play off each other well and make a very handsome couple the supporting cast is outstanding from the always likable felix <UNK> to the villain joseph <UNK> br br frank morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters i've ever seen him do in his career he takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him that twist is another reason this film rises above others of its kind br br once again when a film has a good mix of categories it usually succeeds this is a great example of that in this movie it's romance comedy and drama and it's well done i'll take this over the re make you've got mail any day no comparison
<START> the story is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa but it is so much more than that br br anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things a longing for another one of a different race that cannot be <UNK> even a glance is forbidden there are no words needed their facial expressions say everything br br it is the story of a black servant <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and a white woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other br br the little girl france <UNK> <UNK> is lonely and spends all her time with <UNK> she really can't see this dance br br one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the <UNK> of the <UNK> they cannot even get <UNK> for bed by themselves there world is about to end they just don't know it yet their racist attitudes will be <UNK> with their presence br br i think i would like to visit this africa it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals
<START> for a long time i haven't seen so beautiful animated feature having healthy respect for pixar i must say that <UNK> or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here the graphics is amazing the background surroundings are mind blowing almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly sometimes i felt <UNK> down my spine so much i loved what i've seen br br the plot is absolutely romantic as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be the characters are lovable especially hector the blue rabbit he owns <UNK> rocks and rules the other <UNK> s are very nice also the humor is top notch br br generally it seemed that creators didn't <UNK> much effort into this i mean it looked like it didn't take em too much in difference from people of pixar <UNK> who try hard every time to think on something new and i'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great they've made a magnificent touching movie a candy for eye and heart br br the only minus is stupid beginning and that's why it's <UNK> not 10 10
<START> no scenario bad actors poor melissa gilbert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br give a such budget to make this in <UNK> we make ten films which win all <UNK> in cannes with this br br last time that i've seen a such <UNK> film was <UNK> but scenario was better br br is anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school film or a cop br br the better things in this film was the word end br br why <UNK> to sell this <UNK> is to expensive br br i've pay ten dollars to buy this br br for me pay for this was my big mistake of millennium br br too bad br br next time i'll break my arm but buy this type of sh t
<START> my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage the acting was on the caliber of a <UNK> grade production of <UNK> and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane 85 of the script is four letter words and <UNK> variations on them mother f seems to be the writer's favorite because it is used constantly it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward don't waste your time or money with this
<START> after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the <UNK> 1976 to be the final chapter in the series dirty harry is back older more <UNK> and <UNK> than ever since the original 1971 classic br br dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer vigilante cops and vietnam veteran terrorists but now he's after a new killer a killer who wants <UNK> by <UNK> down her <UNK> br br sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry callahan is on a new murder case that is <UNK> back to a woman played by sondra locke who was brutally raped along with her sister who is left <UNK> ten years after she's out for revenge by <UNK> down her <UNK> at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he <UNK> a mob boss to a heart attack of which the mob are hunting him as well so in order to let the heat die down within the city harry is on order to take a vacation on a <UNK> town but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well while hunting her <UNK> one by one harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar as he homes in on the killer's <UNK> br br sudden impact in my opinion has to be one of my top 10 revenge films as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet far better than both the <UNK> and the dead pool combined sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had a dark tone with entertaining value br br so do you feel lucky punk
<START> i've been using imdb for a few years now but have never written any reviews before however this movie so disappointed me even with a modest score of 6 4 at the time of writing that i couldn't keep quiet anymore br br noise is the story of a new <UNK> tim robbins who is so <UNK> by noise <UNK> that he takes on an alter ego as a as a vigilante the <UNK> and <UNK> any cars he finds with a car alarm sounding br br i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a <UNK> although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned the only true focus of our protagonist is car <UNK> car <UNK> car <UNK> car <UNK> there is really no other focus when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise <UNK> to the problem of car <UNK> it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of <UNK> character br br yes we're all annoyed by noise nobody likes the sound of car <UNK> of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a <UNK> vehicle and this movie uses that fact and pretty much that fact alone to sell this movie i say <UNK> <UNK> because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship including a completely needless <UNK> which is obviously thrown in for those movie goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie honestly it's eye rolling br br <UNK> character very shortly into the movie becomes completely <UNK> it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry car bashing dude into this hero of the little guy the <UNK> however the transformation doesn't take place he just <UNK> himself br br i could go on for a while annoying <UNK> social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the <UNK> of the movie and the self satisfied <UNK> which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either br br overall i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be as it's pretty much shoved down your throat but in my opinion it fails in a big way just one guy's opinion cheers
<START> if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to <UNK> up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over 2 hour movie about the french revolution and also didn't have any sets and had to have my 4 year old <UNK> son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn't make the <UNK> of that year's soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didn't work except for one time when it accidentally started <UNK> in and couldn't stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet <UNK> hilarious hell worthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george <UNK> latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little <UNK> of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a <UNK> duel space laser battle i don't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it but that's not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace
<START> for anyone with a <UNK> sensibility a <UNK> feeling of the human and <UNK> condition for anyone capable of getting above the hollywood <UNK> for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of <UNK> willis van <UNK> <UNK> the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp <UNK> with comprehend laugh with cry with natural tender heart warming hilarious compassionate human beings le <UNK> <UNK> is waiting for you <UNK> van <UNK> has not achieved simply a masterpiece that would have been too simplistic he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of <UNK> is it a drama is it a comedy no it is the story of georges a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality a <UNK> of the <UNK> syndrome it is a story which has you laughing through your tears but this is not one of those classic tear <UNK> this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration warmth and even love a successful <UNK> salesman harry <UNK> into georges they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely <UNK> ideas problems and <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> these two unlikely men into a warm friendship but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road this is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other the <UNK> <UNK> scenes fit in perfectly georges recalls or <UNK> past scenes of his life while either day dreaming or sleeping even the almost <UNK> final scene is totally correct the only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show rooms however this does not detract from the whole this film is a <UNK> even if your french is not up to much please bear seeing it with sub titles le <UNK> <UNK> is worth the trouble as for anything else well just read the following <UNK>  i go along with all of them this film is a joy it is <UNK> it is unique if you have seen rain man' which i consider an excellent film you must see this one it is far superior because it has not the superficial <UNK> of famous hollywood produced world renowned actors it has <UNK> <UNK> and daniel <UNK>  ten oscars for these two and three more for <UNK> van <UNK> who <UNK> yes 11 out of 10 if the imdb rating doesn't break down under the strain br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time the movie was boring long long and awful plot the special effects sucks like hell it's like watching a movie back in 1999 it's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time matthew <UNK> performance was quite bad i saw him in band of brothers playing lt <UNK> he wasn't that bad in fact not bad at all but in this film his acting wasn't convincing enough it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either plus his eyes seems empty like he's not feeling it it surprised me really because he was good in band of brothers br br anyway don't even bother to watch this movie it's a big big big waste of time even if you had to kill an hour or two get something else to do besides watching this movie trust me you'll regret it
<START> typically kids films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13 but then again that's before holes hit the scene sure it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions the acting was decent and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other <UNK> was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine kind of like the <UNK> redemption in many ways which holes also has a similar <UNK> ending to it the only down side the hokey looking <UNK> overall however an 8 10
<START> this movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it this movie was not just bad as in low budget badly acted etc although it certainly was all of those things the problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and doing it with great success what i want to know is is this supposed to be a horror movie i mean it's <UNK> horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be i could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing but what the hell is the second segment it's just annoying the third segment is like watching an artsy student film which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment it's an atrocity that this movie isn't way low on the bottom 100 so get your votes 1 10 in people i know some people gave this good reviews but well they're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you trust me it is impossible to like this movie the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life <UNK> effect it feels like you've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed
<START> i didn't mind all the walking people really did walk places back then it <UNK> an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians i too was disappointed by the effects in particular the <UNK> scene which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book but i can't praise this film enough for its <UNK> to <UNK> story it's about time the actors are likable and the performances are charming also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie <UNK> truly great musical score it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london
<START> at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephant br br once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar <UNK> they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses br br i've just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldn't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be <UNK> the <UNK> tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles
<START> this movie is written by charlie <UNK> who has before this done the legendary fast show and his own show based on one of fast show's characters tony the car sales man he's also written james bond books for kids br br actually i've seen before this only <UNK> movies that are based on <UNK> stories and every one of those is marvelous here gordon tries to do something different the style is totally contemporary which means shaky camera fast and strange cutting cool <UNK> music in the background it works quite well here i guess but it's still pointless and cheap it makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his <UNK> camera in front of the actors actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures hoping that something tolerable would come out of it the casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere which is the result of good directing i think the main character the zero young guy is quite interesting in his <UNK> the fat guy is also good and the guy who looks like alec baldwin but is not him but pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not so interesting in this case i mean an endless line of scenes of <UNK> and sickness there is not much humanity in this film story it's totally <UNK> and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead needless to say that there is no humor either it's a <UNK> long vomit without no relief in any moment anyway gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today and i think of this movie as an experiment and as a failure in that everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes just to learn and to find their way again this might be <UNK> most uninteresting and empty work
<START> when i first saw a small scene of it in some <UNK> i thought the show would be entertaining to watch the little robot guy does look kinda cute the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows before the show aired i studied it through some sources there i did became slightly <UNK> the three children tommy gus and lola are voiced appropriately but <UNK> is an exception it would have been a lot <UNK> if he were to be portrayed by a young <UNK> one good example is robot jones a robot character from whatever happened to robot jones the show isn't bad really but the way <UNK> is <UNK> portrayed is my only criticism thus i don't watch it much
<START> i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and i'll be on the <UNK> for the next movie like it i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick nor did it over <UNK> that fact the characters all had human traits the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly <UNK> and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives i give this movie two thumbs so far up definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years
<START> if you hate redneck accents you'll hate this movie and to make it worse you see patrick <UNK> a has been trying to be a redneck i really can't stand redneck accents i like billy bob <UNK> he was good in <UNK> but he was annoying in this movie and what kind of name is <UNK> earl how much more <UNK> can this movie get the storyline was stupid i'm usually not this <UNK> of movies but i couldn't stand this movie if you want a good billy bob <UNK> movie go see <UNK> br br my mom found this movie for 5 95 at wal mart figures i think i'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas it could just be that i can't stand redneck accents usually or that i can't stand patrick <UNK> maybe if patrick <UNK> wasn't in it i didn't laugh once in the movie i laugh at anything stupid usually if they had shown <UNK> fingers getting <UNK> i might have laughed people's fingers getting <UNK> by accident always makes me laugh
<START> miraculously this is actually quite watchable i mean it's bad it's really bad but whereas the original was so bad it's ruining my life bad this is so bad it's mildly entertaining bad right that's enough faint praise production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the romero wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the <UNK> fence it's mocking internal logic takes a back seat to heads <UNK> themselves out of <UNK> virus <UNK> times <UNK> as the <UNK> requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not gore is the draw obviously but the <UNK> is so <UNK> it's annoying the dialogue sounds like it's been translated by the same computers that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the scale of the zombie <UNK> is implied with none of the <UNK> of romero's films it's all topped off with a horrendous <UNK> score absolute rubbish
<START> this is a film not porn br br this is a wonderful film full of tender moments and memories a beautiful piece of work excellent for intelligent viewers only br br if you are a film lover a romantic a person who has loved deeply this is your film br br it has a beautiful surreal quality fine acting and directing watching this film made me remember my first love br br <UNK> is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss br br highly recommended for all film lovers
<START> this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still roll with it you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character played by jean pierre <UNK> who is trapped between two no three women we listen to his social philosophical and moral <UNK> in interminable monologues we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could be the premise for a <UNK> movie full of rigid cold uninteresting <UNK> yet director jean <UNK> manages to keep it fresh ironic and witty being such a long movie one cannot but burst into laughing when after 2 hours of speaking <UNK> jean pierre <UNK> all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone <UNK> the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of <UNK> <UNK> towards the end of the movie 3 and 1 2 hours and <UNK> every minute
<START> jane eyre is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book br br the whole <UNK> <UNK> is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> for the whole story and the rest of jane's life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie br br do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte <UNK> masterfully told it
<START> first i did like this film it was well acted by all br br however i don't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few gotta see <UNK> but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes i won't mention what <UNK> me in so as not to spoil a good film for others still despite it seeming obvious i kept watching it was nice to see how everything played out filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes br br i don't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film i only hate it when the road to resolution is <UNK> with boring scenery br br will smith's screen persona is just likable even when he's playing such a troubled character he's energetic and believable in everything that i've seen him do seven pounds is another fine performance br br rosario dawson is a solid performer portraying a quirky rather upbeat character despite a <UNK> heart condition beauty is in the eye of the <UNK> and with rosario if you don't find her gorgeous you should think about replacing your eyes br br it was nice to see woody <UNK> back on the screen i haven't seen him much lately but that could just be me woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time but he sold his jolly piano playing blind man character for all it was worth excellent br br a <UNK> bit of research on the box <UNK> tells me that its <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot br br overall i have to recommend this film not for the plotting but for some very good performances and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid
<START> i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest and rather plodding and dull br br it's actually far better than that and i found myself really enjoying it i don't know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know married to albert who died young and she <UNK> him ever after seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing i'd seen more of the story and i imagine we may see a sequel at some point br br visually the film is stunning the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too <UNK> and over the top the acting is top notch from everybody involved br br in a word it was great
<START> the lead characters in this movie fall into two categories smart and stupid simple enough br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a hapless dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit when he tries to get <UNK> <UNK> by his evil former boss the situation gets out of control br br while <UNK> is genuinely but <UNK> stupid his buddy <UNK> is an absolute <UNK> idiot who <UNK> everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time without <UNK> <UNK> might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success with <UNK> life will never be boring but it sure won't be without a lot of <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> an evil genius type who <UNK> into some hitler esquire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his henchmen try to kill <UNK> to keep <UNK> secrets safe br br i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films for a relatively small country the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment the best czech movies i have seen are 1 <UNK> and 2 <UNK> <UNK> dark blue world if you see these two movies you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema
<START> i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival and there was not a dry eye in the house it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age br br it also made me think how disgusting mtv was and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way they <UNK> shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all br br it's a wonderful and heart warming true story take your <UNK> but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be
<START> <UNK> fox is one of the most <UNK> and wonderfully photographed <UNK> films ever made br br the film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind <UNK> to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic set against an <UNK> countryside the audience's hearts warm to the family members br br the music score and lyrics tell the story <UNK> with narration about what is happening in general terms br br man remains one of the biggest <UNK> but we are left in no doubt that the <UNK> are capable of living not just surviving beyond human <UNK>
<START> maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all br br the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for <UNK> he convinces robert <UNK> to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin <UNK> away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob <UNK> another unusual duo for films br br <UNK> sounds just as he did in <UNK> marie <UNK> perhaps he needed to return to that genre br br this film is ridiculous at best hard to believe that the following year maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in the prime of miss jean <UNK> br br ms smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb red head but by film's end she is the brains of the outfit too bad the writing didn't go the way with her
<START> i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival where i went when i was in hollywood that this film was in screening basically there is an election for the new <UNK> of the hong kong <UNK> <UNK> sing society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this the struggle is between candidates <UNK> <UNK> simon <UNK> and big d tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for control of the oldest and most powerful <UNK> parts of the society also starring louis <UNK> as jimmy lee nick cheung as jet cheung <UNK> <UNK> as mr so <UNK> <UNK> as big head and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so it's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller very good
<START> the 1980s tv show updated with fresh female flesh and raunchy language the dukes of hazzard passed me by it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california or i probably would have watched still from somewhere like the clips accompanying this film's updated 2005 release i knew it was about a fast orange dodge <UNK> and the general lee is still good to go br br hunky cousins <UNK> william scott and johnny <UNK> as bo and luke duke are the new riders of the orange <UNK> beautiful jessica simpson as daisy fills her skimpy short well but even her <UNK> pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a <UNK> full of <UNK> topless <UNK> the too stupid plot involves a <UNK> burt reynolds as boss <UNK> threatening to turn hazzard county into a strip mine br br the dukes of hazzard 7 27 <UNK> jay <UNK> <UNK> william scott johnny <UNK> jessica simpson burt reynolds
<START> when i was in school i made a film about a couple <UNK> around in the trees and talking and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic <UNK> but a cliché of canadian cinema <UNK> <UNK> married to <UNK> metaphor <UNK> stabs at social commentary but whatever my own film's <UNK> i feel much better after seeing this this thing for one thing mine ran 20 minutes not 85 and had more content at that every pointless bit of business here is <UNK> over for four five six relentless minutes the male lead is just incredible a brow beating <UNK> creep given to <UNK> of drama class <UNK> in between philosophical insights <UNK> from the u of t pub and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him admittedly if he weren't such an a hole then the third act would make even less sense as a couple <UNK> <UNK> show up to provide distant and thoroughly <UNK> echoes of <UNK> values but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the <UNK> creep <UNK> please in <UNK> until the magazine runs out i take back what i said about <UNK> born which at least had the courage of its own <UNK> <UNK> this cinematic <UNK> is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time at least i really really hope so
<START> i'm <UNK> this on my observations of one episode i saw last night 9 27 <UNK> i don't think i'll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with <UNK> cancer the lead actor victor <UNK> seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are <UNK> the writing to india or china i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season
<START> brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic which was based on <UNK> <UNK> play still life a doctor <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> from a woman's eye at a <UNK> station he is in a miserable relationship she is happily married social worker of italian <UNK> they meet by accident on another occasion form an instant attraction and <UNK> to meet each other every <UNK> the pair fall in love but after spending a few <UNK> together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part <UNK> original one act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love sophia loren and richard burton two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics are <UNK> idea of <UNK> <UNK> loren in particular is miscast sophia loren in full make up looking like a million dollars working as a part time <UNK> social worker at a citizen advice <UNK> just doesn't ring true burton looking <UNK> with <UNK> hair too much make up and wearing platform shoes doesn't come across as your average general <UNK> that said you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their <UNK> burton is married to a literary critic who spends her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt <UNK> husband jack <UNK> <UNK> around the house all day and is <UNK> boring the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous their final scene together will <UNK> <UNK> you've been a long long way away etc that great british <UNK> actor john <UNK> has a three minute cameo as <UNK> friend and appears to be slightly <UNK> speaking his lines in a barely <UNK> voice it's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal awful rehash of a cinema classic avoid at all costs
<START> i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy however that is not to say it wasn't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear it's set in <UNK> century brazil where rival french and portuguese <UNK> are <UNK> the <UNK> people as <UNK> in their battle to <UNK> <UNK> what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french the hero is a likable frenchman the portuguese are <UNK> and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy the film's portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes it's about <UNK> <UNK> by environment in a time <UNK> defined by <UNK> enemies are made and <UNK> and like so the <UNK> <UNK> never progresses br br a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an <UNK> tribe the <UNK> after they massacre a group of portuguese the <UNK> <UNK> predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to <UNK> as revenge for the <UNK> brother being killed by a <UNK> <UNK> ball thinking the frenchman is portuguese they believe they now have one nevertheless the frenchman is granted <UNK> course of the village is sooner or later given a wife and assumes their <UNK> appearance rather than his western clothes or any clothes another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese then <UNK> the <UNK> frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure <UNK> that another european has hidden nearby br br i found the opening scene funny because its narration <UNK> with its <UNK> on screen serve as great satire even if the movie didn't seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often it's actually not a terribly riveting film the <UNK> essential locale fierce way of life and <UNK> native women make not only the frenchman but us too forget any threat and we have the feeling of him as a free man it should not be that terribly hard to escape the <UNK> is as <UNK> of desire as the full frontal nudity of the cast suggested in <UNK> as the representative core of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social <UNK> at any rate this <UNK> era social commentary shot on location at a bay with <UNK> islands played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in <UNK> encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are <UNK> because they've repeated themselves for centuries
<START> i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it cary grant <UNK> <UNK> stanley <UNK> all icons in their own way however the train wreck that was <UNK> parker ruined the entire experience for me her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open not believing my eyes or ears i could barely make it through one viewing that's how hideous she is in this br br cary gorgeous and in fine dramatic form <UNK> adorable endearing and obviously having a ball the supporting cast does alright and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning retro <UNK> br br then you see <UNK> parker attempting to speak her lines with a <UNK> a <UNK> a <UNK> that simply defies belief who told this creature she could act <UNK> <UNK> people
<START> <UNK> and i recently aired as an episode of <UNK> p o v series it's based on a taped interview of georges <UNK> a k a <UNK> <UNK> creator from 1971 in which in <UNK> his various experiences <UNK> his popular character first in a catholic newspaper then in his own series of comic books awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of <UNK> dreams i first encountered <UNK> in the pages of children's <UNK> at my local <UNK> school library reading the secrets of the <UNK> my mom later got a <UNK> to cd and i read the entire red <UNK> treasure every month in 1978 i remember seeing some <UNK> comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason i didn't get any probably because i was 12 and i thought i was <UNK> them i do have breaking free a book written and drawn by j daniels published in 1989 six years after <UNK> death haven't read it yet this film also covers the <UNK> personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a <UNK> in his employ whom he later married her name is <UNK> and she is interviewed here if you love <UNK> and his creator this film is definitely worth a look update 9 4 <UNK> i've now read breaking free <UNK> and the captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are <UNK> to the anti <UNK> views of mr daniels with <UNK> portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for the captain who he's staying with the captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves <UNK> they and other construction workers <UNK> to strike after a fellow employee dies from a <UNK> equipment accident the whole thing takes place in england with working class cockney accents intact not the kind of thing <UNK> would <UNK> of but an interesting read nonetheless oh yes dog snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover which has <UNK> running over the police and the dedication page
<START> i don't give much <UNK> to aids conspiracy theories but its <UNK> interesting to see the phenomenon <UNK> in the early years of the aids <UNK> the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme <UNK> <UNK> of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared <UNK> than in this film a sense of darkness and <UNK> <UNK> every scene br br while the acting and plot can't be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and <UNK> dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> and cynical jewish lesbian police detective she's interesting though not necessarily convincing br br highlights the film's use of the <UNK> tragic <UNK> is an effective <UNK> and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron <UNK>
<START> a female <UNK> played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row br br it starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most b films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a bang br br i would rate it very high on the low cost very sexy movies of the 90's it's a must see once the kids are away or in bed
<START> this movie is so good i could watch it all day long mary kate and ashley were robbed at oscar time if i got to be one of the actors i would be so excited i can't wait for the new charlie's angels movie starring mary kate and ashley
<START> <UNK> look at <UNK> life br br this film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a <UNK> but the deliberate <UNK> of <UNK> life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the <UNK> rapes one of his <UNK> and it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical <UNK> besides the two main characters a <UNK> depressed woman and her young son every one else in the <UNK> is a gross caricature of <UNK> br br the story centers on how the <UNK> like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this <UNK> every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like <UNK> <UNK> violence <UNK> <UNK> etc for example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical <UNK> youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and <UNK> personality he cares more about <UNK> foreign <UNK> than the health of his dying mother he treats these <UNK> like trash after his little brother <UNK> of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service he orders quote  linda go take shower and i <UNK> in two minutes br br there is one other good character in this movie  a european <UNK> who plays the mother's boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son the boyfriend <UNK> him by breaking the <UNK> arm he is <UNK> kicked out of the <UNK> then for violent behavior against one of the <UNK> members more <UNK> the <UNK> annoying french woman who plays the school teacher <UNK> that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is <UNK> the head of the <UNK> in the fields who then in turn <UNK> the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br the film portrays the <UNK> like some sort of cult children get <UNK> out of their <UNK> in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear <UNK> in the fields <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> the mother apparently can't escape the <UNK> although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose it's a mystery how the boy's father died but you can rest assured the <UNK> drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that <UNK> down on the mother and her son br br that's the <UNK> of this movie one dimensional characters over <UNK> dry performances and an <UNK> message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head  that <UNK> life was <UNK> miserable and even deadly for those who didn't fit in i feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a <UNK> but i feel as though he took a few <UNK> of truth regarding <UNK> life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
<START> a fantastic show and an <UNK> classic the league of gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times br br with a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired formulaic approach of it's inferior yet unfortunately far more acknowledged <UNK> little britain the league of gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in british comedy br br up until it's arrival on the scene there had never really been anything like the league of gentlemen before on the surface a seemingly simplistic sketch show the show soon unfolds as a vivid sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations what really sets the show apart from it's rivals is it's approach to telling us it's story rather than serve us re <UNK> sketches barely <UNK> from the next here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various <UNK> and story lines no visit to them is the same and each time they offer us up with a surprise br br gradually over three <UNK> and a christmas special the fictional town of <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> with a grotesque yet hilarious <UNK> and that's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch and also the reason why the show would easily merit more <UNK> unlike other current shows like the catherine <UNK> show or more importantly little britain the league both know when a character has run it's course and have the opportunity to deal with that several fan <UNK> who could have easily been kept on to entertain further <UNK> out before the series came to a close giving room for fellow characters to grow more or allow for the introduction of newer residents of <UNK> <UNK> to make their mark br br another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence as mentioned before all four members of the league have a sound mind when it comes to judging the <UNK> of their creations and when it's time to call it <UNK> in respect to certain characters this awareness has also meant the league of gentlemen <UNK> a bold evolution not usually seen in a show of this nature the narrative driven and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two <UNK> and this bold move by the league really pays off with the third series there's less of an urgency for them to please an audience and like the christmas special they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative unlike the more sketch based previous <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> together various sets of sketches into a <UNK> long story arc br br the third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style as well as a real treat for fans who've already seen the first two despite some <UNK> opinion on the third series any real fan of the league will appreciate what the third series has to offer as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes that only delve deeper into fan <UNK> but pair up and inter wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously br br it might take a little trying to get into the change in style but it's definitely worth it and in my opinion the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series br br the show's not without it's <UNK> and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place but for the most part the genius writing dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters that are often all too close to real life make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame
<START> i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart no other story had such a unfinished ending i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites because it was so unusual a story about <UNK> and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that can't be <UNK> and the need for others <UNK> is made alone when the wolf kills his mother but the wolf is alone too when <UNK> follows him into the mountain the wolf doesn't kill the <UNK> even though each night he says maybe i'll eat you tomorrow the tape of it i have is broken and <UNK> from age and use i will <UNK> it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child stories like this with this depth and feeling and this <UNK> of meaning are very rare it is a sad story but i've never encountered any <UNK> more beautifully made i am glad i have seen this movie and i'm glad i saw it as a child
<START> this is a lovely tale of guilt driven obsession br br <UNK> on a lonely night <UNK> in <UNK> passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge <UNK> he passes by without a word only the <UNK> in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act and then only too little and too late br br the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman on a <UNK> of local bars he finds her <UNK> he pieces more and more of her life together his look changes as his obsession grows he has to make things right in a <UNK> filmed dialog with the bastard ex boyfriend he forces <UNK> to face up to the guilt that both feel br br haunting long takes a gritty soundtrack to <UNK> the guilt <UNK> dogs footsteps lovely film noir with a lovely twist a good indie ending
<START> this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and <UNK> an uneasy alliance obviously the two characters have vastly <UNK> views on how to deal with crime and what <UNK> punishment it's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along i won't go <UNK> to the storyline here but i will get into the acting which is terrific everyone is well cast the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters the same filmmakers that made batman dead end and grayson also made this short film of the three i probably liked this one the least but i still thought it was well done for me world's finest is a 7 10
<START> i look at this page and it seems <UNK> to me to have to listen to someone <UNK> and rant at a real classic sure i agree to let everyone have their opinion but here's mine br br this movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher and should be seen many casual viewers around the world sure it has lost some of it's flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but that's not why you should like it br br you should like it because it actually is a scary movie even for today's standards it's overall <UNK> will creep you out just as much as the original audiences so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance watch it but not with a critical attitude watch it to have fun how it was originally intended
<START> i can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie i can honestly say i'd rather <UNK> my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again the acting was so awful that it was almost funny the story was insanely weak with plot holes so <UNK> wide you could fly an <UNK> through them the script was so poor if i found out that a 10 year old wrote it i shouldn't be in the least surprised the direction and production is so amateur i wouldn't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video utter utter drivel those responsible for making this movie have <UNK> the art and they should be ashamed of themselves steven segal should never ever show his face in public again i can't imagine what made him agree to star in this the worst film i have seen in my entire life
<START> seriously what were they thinking over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and <UNK> away from the usual successful formula but this movie really <UNK> it this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie br br main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation also the overall is just totally different and more <UNK> br br director alan j <UNK> did some other columbo movies in the past which all very much <UNK> to the usual formula it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie br br the columbo character himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding the absence of some good <UNK> and trademark columbo humor also doesn't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch br br in all honesty the movie doesn't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more <UNK> with its story as it progresses it's such a stupid written kidnap thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn't know to entertain its viewers in any way br br it also doesn't help much that the supporting actors aren't the most talented ones around despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie can you just <UNK> how this movie would had been without him it would had been an extremely bad and <UNK> cheap movie i can tell you br br an odd columbo entry which could be described as a failed experiment to <UNK> from the usual formula br br 4 10
<START> i have never posted a review before but i had to do it for this film this film is so bad i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as <UNK> or parody but it isn't it is truly un self <UNK> bad this is a serious attempt that <UNK> <UNK> other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws so i'll try not to repeat these but i do urge you to see this film throughout it i was either speechless literally <UNK> with disbelief or rolling on the floor in <UNK> i haven't had so much fun watching a film in years in fact i'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared br br my favorite parts when arthur <UNK> to be a go go boy his dancing is unbelievable the gratuitous nudity the director leading actor just had to get a nude shot in the <UNK> office with its cardboard and <UNK> rendition of christ of course the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings what narrative function does this play the ex wife's wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun the detailed sequence <UNK> arthur kills the preacher he apparently burns him up with this incredibly <UNK> match yes the gay religious fanatic brother with his <UNK> hair and <UNK> fashions and my favorite the use of <UNK> the entertainer as the opening soundtrack and <UNK> <UNK> in d major as the closing soundtrack the list goes on and on a must see
<START> i first saw this movie years ago and have continued to view it several times a year when i have an opportunity it is on my list of favorite movies along with some of the classics should anyone tell you it is foolish or outdated ignore them this movie is for anyone who enjoys laughing and music the dancing isn't as important in this film as in other astaire movies so the comedy and acting shine through see this movie if you can it may be light but it is still completely amusing so i know that many people hate black and white films they think old movies can't really be funny this movie should make them change their minds no one i know can watch this movie without being at least mildly amused the only problem with the film fred astaire singing without dancing he may be a great performer and capable singer but it just isn't fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story the comedy gets a bit cliché at times but the <UNK> performances of g burns and g allen are just perfect for the piece and can satisfy anyone looking for some easy laughs give this film a chance even if you don't like old movies this movie can appeal to the ridiculous in any one
<START> br br what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were doing <UNK> up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick do not waste your time on this <UNK>
<START> i refused to watch this when it originally aired <UNK> the memory of the late <UNK> 1960s series with mike <UNK> and kenneth cope but i can never resist a challenge i should have known better not quite a remake and more of a parody than a homage this show didn't quite know how to play it and <UNK> with <UNK> comedy and cartoon plots and characters the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors and only <UNK> fox could act bob <UNK> is painful in a straight role the supporting cast were merely comedian <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> wanting to be part of the in joke and far too aware of the situation to be convincing and the cgi though the effects couldn't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier merely <UNK> the viewer with lights and camera work and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue all style and no substance and whereas the 1960s show is <UNK> for being very much of its time this <UNK> is now also very dated with <UNK> style fashions obligatory <UNK> <UNK> scenes and less than subtle tension between the two living leads
<START> while not exactly offensive the 1967 version of the <UNK> of pauline is certainly moronic the title might lead you to expect a tribute to pearl white the original pauline in the <UNK> silent 20 episode serial but for that you would be better served by the <UNK> version starring betty <UNK> this 1967 version is like a mix of casino <UNK> and the weakest of the elvis movies worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone <UNK> taped together segments from each so that the thing <UNK> back and forth between the two styles br br what <UNK> there is in the production comes from the pairing of pamela austin pauline and pat <UNK> george <UNK> a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills imagine mandy moore playing opposite dan <UNK> br br austin would later play opposite john <UNK> in evil roy <UNK> with the talent <UNK> between them actually painful to watch in the mid 60's she was the dodge rebellion girl as such she was featured in a similar series of <UNK> situations imagine sandra dee in a dark blue <UNK> when the <UNK> ad agency replaced her with the dodge fever girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film br br what story there is here begins with pauline growing up in the <UNK> <UNK> home run by the actress who played mrs <UNK> <UNK> sr on <UNK> <UNK> george falls in love with her pauline not mrs <UNK> and <UNK> several opportunities she has to be adopted george leaves to seek his fortune and 19 year old pauline gets a job <UNK> a young oil rich middle eastern prince when he tries to add the attractive blonde to his <UNK> she runs away and goes from peril to peril these include african <UNK> a <UNK> year old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year old <UNK> is old enough for marriage the movie industry and the russian space program br br all this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part there is some effort to <UNK> a silent film look to the action sequences by <UNK> the under <UNK> of a camera which <UNK> up the action unfortunately everything else film stock production design editing is <UNK> 1960's nothing here even approaches the images of pearl white <UNK> to a <UNK> moving toward a buzz saw or tied to <UNK> track waiting for the approaching train br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this is an old fashioned wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing <UNK> witch ever unlike many modern stories which seem to <UNK> in dark witchcraft this is simply a magical tale of <UNK> <UNK> that is cute light hearted and charming br br the tale is set back in 1940 in the english village of <UNK> eye where three cockney children charlie carrie paul <UNK> are being <UNK> out of danger from world war ii city air <UNK> they are <UNK> sent to live with <UNK> price who is studying by <UNK> course to become an apprentice witch <UNK> and the trio of children use a magic bed <UNK> in order to travel to london on their flying bed here they encounter <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of miss <UNK> witchcraft training <UNK> school miss price sets about working on spells designed to bring <UNK> objects to life meanwhile they must also deal with a shady character called the <UNK> and his associate <UNK> br br angela lansbury is of course <UNK> endearing as the eccentric witch in training miss price david <UNK> plays mr <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> witchcraft school who has now turned street magician this actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie mary <UNK> in fact this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier mary <UNK> both wonderful fantasy stories for children perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but it does <UNK> some appealing little tunes some have been critical but the movie features excellent special effects all in all the story is enchanting family entertainment it's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely <UNK> tale which should appeal to the child in all of us
<START> a <UNK> thriller of alienation and paranoia extremely well done and polanski performs well as the <UNK> <UNK> trying hard to adapt to his <UNK> paris <UNK> and his fellow <UNK> horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow <UNK> and horrifying later on as he develops his <UNK> which will ultimately be his <UNK> personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic bearing in mind the storyline nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element but then maybe that was intended because the <UNK> certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end i can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a <UNK> frenchman and jewish to boot still there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle <UNK> and good old <UNK> winters is as reliable as ever
<START> richard <UNK> beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris <UNK> is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies julie <UNK> turns in one of the <UNK> most engaging performances as the <UNK> <UNK> who spends a day with stranger on a train ethan hawke the dialogue and there is <UNK> of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments
<START> i understand the jokes quite well they just aren't good the show is horrible i understand it and that's another horrible thing about it the only cool character there ever was on the show was that one <UNK> in that one episode but then i see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible it's not funny not funny i don't want people to say only smart people get it because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it it's like saying the sky is red but never looking outside but anyways this is absolutely the worst show i have ever seen in my life the jokes are terrible i mean you can understand them they're just horrible her controversy is very lame her fart jokes and other jokes on <UNK> <UNK> are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting i'm not sure what these smart people see in this show but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment
<START> johnny <UNK> final film as <UNK> of the <UNK> after 16 years in the role tarzan and the <UNK> is bound to disappoint all but the most <UNK> of his fans at <UNK> the ex <UNK> one of hollywood's most active <UNK> <UNK> was long past the slim <UNK> of his youth and looked tired although he was in <UNK> better condition than in his previous entry tarzan and the <UNK> br br not only had <UNK> gotten too old for his role johnny <UNK> the quintessential <UNK> had grown to <UNK> he was a <UNK> 17 year old so he was written out of the script under the <UNK> of being <UNK> at <UNK> brenda <UNK> at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as <UNK> she would provide the transition when lex barker became the new tarzan in <UNK> <UNK> magic <UNK> and was still as <UNK> sexy as ever br br produced by <UNK> lesser at rko on a <UNK> budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in mexico while the location gave a decidedly hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest africa veteran director robert <UNK> <UNK> the country <UNK> <UNK> cliff diving and an aztec temple into the story br br when a young island girl <UNK> <UNK> future bride linda christian is rescued in a jungle river by tarzan he learns that a local high priest george <UNK> one of <UNK> most enduring villains had virtually <UNK> the local population threatening <UNK> from a living <UNK> if they don't do his <UNK> the girl had been chosen to become the <UNK> bride so she <UNK> faster than you can say <UNK> this a dumb plot or what ' the girl is kidnapped by the <UNK> henchmen and returned to the island and tarzan followed by jane colorful spanish character <UNK> <UNK> played by john <UNK> who sings several tunes and a government <UNK> are off to take on the <UNK> and his priest poor <UNK> is left behind after a series of <UNK> the <UNK> is simply a con man in an aztec mask working with the priest in <UNK> the <UNK> rich pearl <UNK> a bit of <UNK> action and comic relief and songs by <UNK> everything reaches the expected happy conclusion br br remarkably tarzan and the <UNK> features a musical score by the brilliant film composer <UNK> <UNK> and is far better than what you'd expect from this <UNK> movie br br while the film would provide a less than <UNK> end to <UNK> time in <UNK> <UNK> he would immediately go on to play jungle jim a more <UNK> variation of the ape man in <UNK> the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been br br tarzan was about to get a make over and become much <UNK>
<START> despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating this is an awful movie awful enough that l feel <UNK> to warn you how bad it is br br the movie is set in the final period of the raj during the time of <UNK> fight for independence what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief what the characters do and how they behave just does not <UNK> me that the characters exist in that era br br for instance would the young married <UNK> <UNK> from the local village have an affair with her married <UNK> master knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social <UNK> and shame if not mortal punishment unlikely but still maybe however would the same young <UNK> <UNK> in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat <UNK> in hot <UNK> sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment that is not only bloody unlikely that is a retarded plot line br br such <UNK> combined with the poor acting drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie so i did not watch the second half of the movie one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half
<START> this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors or presumed actors a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent <UNK> <UNK> directed by sergio martino in 1973 two years before one of the most celebrated psycho thrillers of italian cinema and a cult movie around the world in la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> the director <UNK> the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an <UNK> tom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in <UNK> movie is ridiculous and inferior to the <UNK> and charming in <UNK> film to put another black girl another white girl and another <UNK> tom <UNK> the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that <UNK> movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to <UNK>
<START> the cult movie for every true russian intellectual everything is brilliant especially acting it's beyond any praise the movie as the book is full of symbols my favorite one is the <UNK> symbol of <UNK> <UNK> russian word for <UNK> often <UNK> the period of lifestyle chaos after the <UNK> 20 civil war the wide opened dirty door in the <UNK> wall <UNK> in the snowy wind and the pitch black hole of the <UNK> behind it br br now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5 1 sound there are well translated english subtitles too though some obscene words of <UNK> were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation i don't know is that dvd available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately it's really worthy of watching br br and in conclusion a fact about the 50 of russians today mostly youth can be identified as <UNK> in a considerable degree it's the post soviet effect soviet people appeared to be wholly <UNK> for the <UNK> attack of the western civilization tv producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive soulless and <UNK> so that it <UNK> the darkest instincts of every russian even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in <UNK> and <UNK> because it's amazingly common in <UNK> speech
<START> don't waste your time on this dreck as portrayed the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture gothic was entertainment at least this is crap if you like watching pretentious and spoiled <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> each other this may be right up your alley lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly <UNK> mary <UNK> appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect what a waste of time see gothic instead i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter but didn't catch the title i was hoping this was it but no such luck not recommended
<START> what a great british movie a screaming good laugh and sexy gary stretch too and oh lots of <UNK> and lovely <UNK> countryside br br members of our club the <UNK> bike and <UNK> social club appear in it as extras <UNK> br br there are some genuinely hilarious bits good acting a good idea br br met the director jon <UNK> at a showing in <UNK> <UNK> a great man down to earth and a good laugh this film must be supported as all great brit movies should br br so please go and see it if you can they have a website with cinemas that are showing it so find one near you br br i can't wait to get the dvd some of our biker friends have seen the film two or three times already and can't get enough of it br br amanda
<START> i really wanted to like this film but the story is <UNK> i don't want to spoil this film don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen but here's an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and <UNK> ride up the <UNK> the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and <UNK> get into a shoot out and race half way down the <UNK> the cowboy is clean <UNK> through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to <UNK> in dark on the back of a horse br br to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
<START> this movie is good for what it is and <UNK> i wouldn't watch it twice however i am a peter cushing <UNK> and that's why i watched it the best asset of this movie is <UNK> and <UNK> compared to other similar movies it does not drag its feet forever as each of the four plus one segments lasts under 30 minutes with the last under 10 good uncanny <UNK> in the first segment horror writer suffering from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to secluded old house seeking inspiration he finds even too much of it when he starts to <UNK> one of his fictional <UNK> plot <UNK> similar to <UNK> burial good use of the point of view twist is the writer getting mentally ill or as the ending shows his <UNK> wife wants her lover to play along with the husband's <UNK> to drive him mad secure his <UNK> yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan br br in the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth which had once separated them from the gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased <UNK> wielding murderer or was she br br the third segment was the less interesting to me br br the fourth shows a horror movies actor who thinks he's the best of all <UNK> to the depths of low budget c movies seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire he gets the real deal this segment also lacks the <UNK> of the first two br br acting is fair with the 2 initial segments <UNK> the bulk of it good movie taken with a grain of salt not the best cushing nor lee but worth watching
<START> i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the 50's my generation anyway but i was truly <UNK> by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending within the last 5 minutes of this film you must focus <UNK> on what's happening never have i been more impressed with the wrap up of a film i remember yelling wow when i realized it was over on the other hand my two daughters fell asleep on the couch
<START> i kind of consider myself as the 1 fan of hidden frontier seeing as i am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys well not counting conventions of course i have been watching hidden frontier since 2001 and i must say i continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with br br hidden frontier is the <UNK> of rob <UNK> and his self made studio <UNK> pictures which <UNK> out of the back room of his house while not as fancy as say the <UNK> based series new <UNK> which sometimes gets some of the actors writers from the original series like walter <UNK> aka mr <UNK> rob and the cast and crew of <UNK> manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called enterprise the most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of star <UNK> first openly gay character corey <UNK> who was introduced in the second season and his search to find a soul mate somewhere later in the series he meets <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> officer in the recent story lines with these two characters warning major spoiler do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point <UNK> is joined to an <UNK> <UNK> causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with <UNK> though the future is uncertain seeing as the most recent episode <UNK> was just shown to <UNK> fans in the chat room last night i think that this relationship will endure but only time will tell br br gene <UNK> created star trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles rob <UNK> created hidden frontier for that same reason and this is what has made this series as popular as it is as the previous comment stated i wish i could give it a rating higher than 10 but it will have to suffice although next season will be the last keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by star trek the next generation i am willing to bet that we will hear much about hidden frontier after that final episode
<START> this movie is horrible it rivals <UNK> in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some <UNK> resort somewhere joe roth should join <UNK> may on the directing <UNK> forever
<START> i loved this show when it aired on television and was crushed when i found out that someone somewhere decided that it wasn't worthy of being continued for years i hung onto my copies of this show ones that i had taped or had someone tape for me that is until now the powers that be finally decided to release this beautiful series on dvd and i finally was able to get my eager little hands on the complete set which brings me to this part the part about that this show is all about br br american gothic is about good <UNK> evil basically a struggle between lucas buck that is buck with a b he is an evil sheriff of a south <UNK> small town that runs things the way he wants things to be ran and stops at nothing to get his way br br i felt the show was wonderfully written and directed and had lots of life left yet to be lived i really hated when it was canceled but that is the way it seems to go for me when i finally find something worth watching on television br br gary cole did a great job as the role of sheriff lucas buck he has just the right amount of charm <UNK> evil to pull it off the other actors did a super job as well so i guess you could say even the casting was a hit with me
<START> some might say something like baby geniuses with its giant robot <UNK> or <UNK> with its psychedelic drug <UNK> nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children you might say that too but you'd be wrong lo and behold for i bring to you santa claus the most <UNK> messed up family film since well ever br br from the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs seriously this segment is nearly 20 <UNK> minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot to the thrilling conclusion in which <UNK> pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day don't mind him he's from <UNK> this is childhood trauma at its finest and no matter how hard i try no matter how many different <UNK> i visit i just can't get those <UNK> laughter out of my head br br avoid this mind <UNK> piece of trash like you'd avoid a sex <UNK> whale during <UNK> season still if <UNK> gay demons with a serious case of the overacting <UNK> are something for you i guess you should give it a try but really this movie isn't worth your time and mental health
<START> <UNK> <UNK> tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of <UNK> complex afterward br br it is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten there's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on <UNK> and <UNK> in a church tower like <UNK> only he is much less sympathetic br br there's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything she happens to look like his mother yes so what we know he misses his mother that's what the first ten minutes were about they should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a o k short film now it's a portrait of a character who doesn't change he is a guy that stuff happens to the only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job br br there's this whole <UNK> thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character he paints his face dresses in women's clothing and wears a dead <UNK> on his head a <UNK> you've got to see the ending he returns to his home with the <UNK> on his head and it is shot like a tacky horror film to kill his <UNK> new wife which he had sex with in the beginning and somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background i've got to admit though i'm kind of <UNK> to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose it feels like this <UNK> director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school you are so smart thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories you really <UNK> what a <UNK> okay so now i realized this film is based on some random book but anyway br br <UNK> it is boring a lot of talking heads plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe <UNK> <UNK> is both a feature and a test film for color blind people or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they <UNK> blue so that we really get it br br i'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation and all the cute sex stuff going on this whole film is an independent cliché but i do recommend it i laughed more than a few times though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine
<START> it's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from <UNK> who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts well i don't know anyone involved and i've seen the final cut and it is pure garbage the only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends none on screen for terribly long it's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like tony todd tom <UNK> david <UNK> and michael <UNK> to film scenes during their coffee breaks this is an ultra cheap shot on video wannabe x files with terrible acting from a cast of non actors with more <UNK> than is acceptable in the 21st century there is little or no action it's all overly <UNK> dialogue that attempts to explain a <UNK> convoluted plot <UNK> computer fx are a joke but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a mst3k way after about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking you'll find yourself reaching for the fast forward button and not letting go absolutely worthless
<START> this movie is more like a music video kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies he feels like making music and when he is making music he feels like making movies the best thing in promise me this is the music written by <UNK> kusturica br br kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise promise me this has very little noise br br i liked life is a miracle it was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later but it had a beautiful plot promise me this has no plot i was awaiting this movie with big expectations because i've read that the script has been written by <UNK> <UNK> one of my favourite <UNK> who <UNK> also in life is a miracle <UNK> <UNK> writes great dialogues but for kusturica they are noise and much to my regret i saw only two dialogues which i could identify as written by <UNK> <UNK> the other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> the man who wrote the scripts for time of the <UNK> and black cat white cat said in an interview that kusturica never follows the script black cat white cat was the only script for which kusturica said that he will not touch it according to <UNK> <UNK> after all kusturica comes back to the script and if he doesn't he doesn't make a good movie and i think this is the case with promise me this he should have followed the script of <UNK> <UNK> br br promise me this is billed as a comedy but there are very few moments which made me laugh the comedic moments are in the same style as black cat white cat but are not that funny at all i think the difference comes from the fact that black cat white cat was written by <UNK> <UNK> br br however i know some people who liked promise me this they find it very positive movie
<START> a family looking for some old <UNK> <UNK> to include in the father's coffee table book come across an ancient <UNK> old freak show run by an eccentric one eyed man when their family van breaks down upon leaving the <UNK> they're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior br br there have been many films in the <UNK> <UNK> of horror ranging from <UNK> <UNK> beloved <UNK> 1932 to alex <UNK> hilarious <UNK> 1993 those are both classics or soon to be with <UNK> <UNK> sho ' however never will be and if it ever does reach classic status well it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre from the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17 year old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother this film did not have much going for it the writing was <UNK> but not completely awful just boring the direction was poor and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable the acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long long time there was far from enough gore violence to make up for the lack of any other quality and when there was a bit of violence it was not well done at all and i can't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were with all honesty some of the worst i've ever ever seen in a film overall this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin br br final verdict 2 5 10
<START> comment this movie is impossible is terrible very improbable bad interpretation e direction not look
<START> as i sat subjected to this <UNK> mediocrity i wondered why why did <UNK> keaton agree to this trash the movie uses meaningless contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands the movie takes a political agenda to a new level the movie was meaningless and all <UNK> was lost to the excessive use of stereotype br br it was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile but in the end she needs to remember the age old <UNK> that you cannot polish a turd i hope that you did not waste your new year's day watching another mindless made for tv movie i now know why the networks started airing series on sunday night to rid us of trash
<START> the same difficulty i have with the musical version of les <UNK> applies equally to oliver instead of the <UNK> writing in the <UNK> period of the play settings they merely wrote broadway type <UNK> which were historically <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br too the blatant brutality and <UNK> activities of the <UNK> do not mix well with some of the sunny <UNK> which <UNK> the score it's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour <UNK> br br the casting of the boy oliver doesn't help matters <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> precious there's something less than solid here fagin performs his traditional routine adequately though the tunes he's <UNK> to sing have little basis in period manner br br as long as he needs me is given a <UNK> rendition <UNK> and strained the two big production numbers who will buy and consider yourself seem over produced with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it's one thing to go all out yet another to cross over the line into excess br br the <UNK> despair and <UNK> of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such <UNK> and choreography while the novel is considered a classic i must confess i have trouble with mr <UNK> consciousness in that his works tend to <UNK> a negative <UNK> this may be due to the <UNK> of his <UNK> personal life which was full of disappointment and regret br br not all the combined talent of this production either on or behind camera can overcome the <UNK> nature of the basic material all this results in an <UNK> <UNK> experience for me br br
<START> adrian <UNK> is excellent is this film he makes a fascinating woman
<START> as one other imdb reviewer has <UNK> this movie starts a bit slow but gets considerably better as it goes along yes it is released by roger corman and yes it goes over some of the same <UNK> ground as much higher budget predecessors such as fatal attraction and poison <UNK> however the <UNK> of the wife's career as a rising blues singer against the husband's gathering loneliness and his almost <UNK> need for filling the emotional and physical void or hole while she's away along with the clever use of minimal effects and settings is nicely done <UNK> a very small number of locations and characters and also using water in almost every scene both as a <UNK> and drowning <UNK> symbol throughout this movie though clearly suffering from a <UNK> budget reminds me in many ways of the more fully realized and more recent scenario namely the french film swimming pool which it seems to me at least may have borrowed <UNK> some useful ideas from up against amanda with a smaller tool set up against amanda maintains its suspense with a <UNK> <UNK> view of <UNK> to ones occasional <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> this as well or better as other films in this genre the twist of the <UNK> abuse of amanda in the past again very <UNK> is also very unique in this genre and interesting i agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction for <UNK> plight this aspect of the story <UNK> the cast is excellent i think br br
<START> christina raines plays a lovely model in new york who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film's end this film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the roman catholic church vs the devil to the <UNK> to hell to bizarre <UNK> to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses <UNK> the film we get <UNK> <UNK> burgess meredith chris sarandon jerry <UNK> deborah <UNK> arthur kennedy jose <UNK> <UNK> miles beverly <UNK> eli <UNK> martin <UNK> christopher <UNK> william <UNK> tom berenger jeff goldblum and who can forget john carradine as the old priest many of these actors ham it up particularly burgess meredith giving a fine comic demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat meredith is memorable as is <UNK> and chris sarandon some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like jose <UNK> in a <UNK> role even if it is nothing more than a cameo the sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes the end scene is repulsive and yet chilling i do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with <UNK> and miles was that really necessary i think not also the father daughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace director michael winner does a <UNK> job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments the scenes with carradine are particularly effective
<START> cut tries to be like most post scream slashers tried to be a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by <UNK> other famous horror movies now i am not <UNK> <UNK> ' as i think <UNK> is a very good horror movie that does a great job of <UNK> horror and comedy cut fails on most levels it has its moments but overall it just does not work out not even as a so bad it's good movie just a below average one br br the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well apart from the fact that <UNK> <UNK> can't really act and ironically she gets her tongue out go figure go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off which is apparently cursed and as you have probably predicted one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman br br unoriginal plot poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow there is plenty of <UNK> in the film everything from <UNK> to 'the texas chain saw massacre ' this isn't smart either it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it really i should be supporting this movie because i'm australian and we're not as good when it comes to horror we do have our gems though but cut is definitely not one of them br br however it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so so that is something good at least i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for but if you are looking for a good movie stay away br br 2 5
<START> this is not the worst film i have seen of peter <UNK> but it is close that <UNK> goes to the even worse <UNK> book this director's films of 3 i have seen i find them all to be miserable like the cook whatever positive cinematic <UNK> he displays are totally <UNK> by the <UNK> of his material and overall presentation
<START> in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments i'd like to offer some advice free of charge from a viewer's perspective if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film do it if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films go ahead do not try to make both at the same time it doesn't work for example having a goofy comic relief character killed and <UNK> and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a <UNK> on a <UNK> head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make this one is boring meandering cheap racist you get the picture a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower way too <UNK> here are hardly worth your trouble there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence 1 2
<START> i was particularly moved by the understated courage and integrity of <UNK> in this beautifully acted intellectually and visually compelling film thank you so much <UNK> le <UNK> rohmer
<START> why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over again br br this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it gosh no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years i obviously wasn't <UNK> my inner <UNK> br br as <UNK> writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom more character development would have been helpful we are never <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> in fact we are led to believe that he is not a <UNK> although <UNK> psycho emotional <UNK> is highly evident
<START> this is my first movie review on imdb i was forced to register after watching this movie i cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be <UNK> by me the people must be warned br br first of all my rating is 0 as in zero br br i love jack black ben stiller rachel <UNK> and christopher walken and yet i hated this movie there is a plot but who cares when there's no script the dialogue is unreal and plain boring the situations are contrived the flow of events is slow and somewhat <UNK> the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting and the story although based on a good premise is stupid this movie is a piece of poo br br never mind wasting money on this movie it's not even worth your time spent watching it please do not see it i beg of you
<START> poorly written conspiracy drama mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government <UNK> plays a gay <UNK> looking for answers that within this <UNK> plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera <UNK> for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade d
<START> i went into this with my hopes up by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn't have been more let down despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake i kept my hopes high that maybe just maybe someone would get it right this time around sadly prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake bad script bad direction cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror br br from beginning to end it's boring repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls we've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this if you go to see prom night in the theater i'd say wait for the dvd or <UNK> get ready for the audience to laugh because laugh they will the laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the <UNK> installment of scary movie seriously was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof the film makers missed the mark so badly here that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie which in retrospect i wish i had done not me though i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better needless to say it didn't the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it but still came out of it with a <UNK> budget movie i halfway expected to see dollar store <UNK> on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere br br this movies scary alright if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed
<START> there are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a <UNK> for the time just spent this was one of those times i almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure and i wish i had br br the pace that a man goes from a straight laced controlled life to one of complete <UNK> and <UNK> could never be this rapid br br from a <UNK> celebration to the predictable ending <UNK> price jesse <UNK> man of <UNK> and culture allows himself to be <UNK> by a woman by violence and by mind <UNK> <UNK> of course the woman part is understandable when <UNK> the talents of the beautiful april <UNK> <UNK> but the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand br br frankly besides being able to stare at <UNK> <UNK> and monica <UNK> this film has no redeeming qualities save your money save your time do anything else
<START> its not as good as the first movie but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his <UNK> wife the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion br br
<START> this movie has it all it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the <UNK> of thousands of cuban <UNK> antonio montana played by al pacino is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of <UNK> drug empire is astonishing brian <UNK> does an amazing job directing this picture so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline as well as every character in the cast with tony's characters' <UNK> being so believable and strong brian <UNK> <UNK> out the raw talent exposed by steven bauer <UNK> tony's best friend mary elizabeth <UNK> gina tony's sister robert <UNK> frank tony's boss and michelle pfeiffer elvira <UNK> wife i enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still watch it on a weekly basis on this year the 20th <UNK> of this classic crime movie i for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers with other crime movies being so dramatic i find this movie is a shock to the system
<START> the critics didn't like this film it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain which was a great shame because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain first br br nicole kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from 'the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic despite being a totally different story br br sure it changes <UNK> a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but it's memorable moving and a <UNK> breath of fresh air compared to the average mega budget blockbuster br br see it with an open mind
<START> oh my god oh my god i cant get over this movie it was god awful horrible terrible don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 <UNK> bin no avoid it at all costs i'm warning you br br it was the worst movie i've ever seen in my life in my life br br first of all g girl are you kidding me get real that sounds like some kind of new <UNK> doll super women are you kidding me it was so fake fake fake fake the people of the town didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just <UNK> her way around the town saving a fire <UNK> big br br jesus was it just me or did this movie seem offensive i guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double <UNK> blonde flowing hair no glasses and a leather skin tight suit br br if it was trying to be romantic than god i don't know it was horrid if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed and in the air than they totally had love br br it was pathetic everything went too fast first that guy was single than he was dating g girl than they broke up than he dated that hannah girl and it just goes on br br i have to say this movie made me wonder how the hell did they get this in theaters br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got <UNK> the selection process br br i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can't say i'm <UNK> i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can't think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
<START> the question is can a movie this entertaining really be considered a bad movie my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for 99 cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words <UNK> pictures on it <UNK> has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films <UNK> and class of 1984 we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was your basic plot as is follows <UNK> this <UNK> thug from planet earth <UNK> the bank of the moon and is sentenced to a <UNK> colony on a remote planet i don't even remember the <UNK> name to mine for <UNK> and other <UNK> the <UNK> of said colony and the owner of the mine are <UNK> the prisoners for labor walker a bounty hunter apparently one of only three on the whole planet reminds the prisoners that there is no escape because there's only one <UNK> out of the whole planet and they'd have him to deal with then there's the <UNK> colonel a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting <UNK> nightmare much of the movie centers around futuristic car chases <UNK> with <UNK> slapped to the sides with explosions <UNK> the planet itself looks <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> or one of those other dusty <UNK> empire <UNK> but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid 80s i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to <UNK> but it's definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack i can't even remember the names of the bands they're listed in the credits other than exploding white mice because that was the only one i'd heard of before i saw this movie but i'm definitely looking into them br br basically the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and a few of your closest friends
<START> the reviewer from <UNK> must be a feminist for she finds young catherine to be a great film and historically accurate nothing could be further from the truth as a practicing russian <UNK> for many many years i took exception with <UNK> at almost every turn and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single handed moved russia into a direction of <UNK> the truth she was only brought to st <UNK> to be a wife and mother and found she had to bond with the <UNK> the <UNK> and the military just to survive so long as she did not challenge them she was able <UNK> to <UNK> her cultural wishes filling up the <UNK> with art <UNK> etc there are so many <UNK> that she was not great but in this area of post modern <UNK> proof is not very popular <UNK> is only a costume drama a bit of fluff from ted turner that like peter the great in 1986 is one more example of how badly russia is portrayed in the west
<START> this film is an attempt to present jared <UNK> theory of guns <UNK> and steel explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe br br the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 <UNK> covering 3 hours i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes there are completely useless scenes of professor jared diamond watching birds through <UNK> professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly professor jared diamond firing a <UNK> <UNK> badly was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of professor jared diamond this part of the documentary was so bad it could have been a spoof the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and <UNK> when <UNK> the <UNK> ward in an african hospital none of this helps me understand his theory of guns <UNK> and steel btw guns <UNK> and steel is said about 100 times can the europeans guns <UNK> and steel get them out of this dire situation stay tuned and find out when he finally gets down to business his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring europeans <UNK> the natives peoples of other lands because they had guns and fine <UNK> against stone and wooden weapons do i really need a professor to convince me of this the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the <UNK> that allow the conquest are interesting but the coverage is paper thin br br in the end i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non europeans are as capable as europeans if i'm not a racist i already know this if i'm a racist jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native <UNK> br br i don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary kids may enjoy this more than i though i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary
<START> i rated this movie as awful 1 after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to offend everyone the trailer said well it did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and what's with all the gays in this movie i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are but what's the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like that br br so my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy <UNK> it really is total crap
<START> this was another obscure christmas related title a low budget mexican production from exploitation film maker <UNK> night of the bloody apes 1969 <UNK> 1977 which  like many a genre effort from this country  was acquired for release in the u s by k gordon murray judging by those two efforts already mentioned <UNK> was no <UNK>  and this one having already received its share of <UNK> over here is certainly no better the film in fact is quite <UNK> of the weirdness which <UNK> mexican horror <UNK> from the era but given an added dimension by virtue of the <UNK> color which in view of the <UNK> of <UNK>  apart from st nick himself the devil plays a major role in the proceedings  throughout was essential anyway in a nutshell the plot involves <UNK> efforts to <UNK> santa <UNK> christmas eve <UNK> with the <UNK> children there is however plenty more <UNK> along the way to begin with our <UNK> white <UNK> and <UNK> merry man in red lives in a <UNK> palace who apart from accompanying toy maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing <UNK> for the whole first reel in their native tongue visits <UNK>  the famed magician at king <UNK> court here <UNK> but <UNK> prone to child like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>  once every year to <UNK> <UNK> which would bring <UNK> to the young and render himself invisible by the way the <UNK> <UNK> presence here is no less unlikely than his being a <UNK> of dr frankenstein in son of dracula 1974 incidentally by this time he always seems to have gained some excess <UNK> santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial <UNK> the devil's antics <UNK> <UNK> his hands together at every turn and generally <UNK> it up to hold up st <UNK> delivery program then is perfectly <UNK> indeed their <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> resemble an old laurel hardy routine more than anything to pad out the running time we focus on three sets of children one the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company projected as a wish <UNK> fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra large <UNK> a girl from a poor family who <UNK> to own a doll of her own the <UNK> one first <UNK> her to steal one then <UNK> the little one's dreams  to no <UNK> and a trio of <UNK> who <UNK> on once again by satan think of nothing but causing <UNK> and eventually fall out amongst themselves there is definitely imagination at work here but it is applied with little rhyme or reason while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure well at bay
<START> i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci fi story in a book or on the screen there's social commentary <UNK> and a good story br br there's something eerie and amusing watching a 1936 view of the <UNK> <UNK> of the 60s and 70s br br i think it's a must see and not only for sci <UNK>
<START> this is the biggest flop of 2008 i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the 3 <UNK> gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's like everyone are having <UNK> they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking <UNK> <UNK> is also done a good job but the <UNK> just forget it
<START> as far as films go this is likable enough entertaining characters good dialogue interesting enough story i would have really quite liked it had i not been irritated immensely whilst watching at the utter <UNK> it shows the city it is set in br br <UNK> in scotland yet every character is english save for <UNK> girlfriend who is dutch scottish accents are heard only <UNK> in <UNK> jobs roles as a scottish woman as a viewer who likes her real life films to be a bit more like real life i really don't think it would have hurt to use any one of the countless talented scottish actors or at least got english ones who could toss together a decent accent the <UNK> attempt at using the word wee a few times did nothing but to further the insult
<START> must every good story be improved with added corny broadway music apparently those who can't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the <UNK> i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably <UNK> out and this was a great example of just that so of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from <UNK> orphan boys to <UNK> <UNK> and suddenly it's uplifting <UNK> <UNK> me a <UNK> br br the four stars in my rating come from casting which i could <UNK> to that of my fair lady each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing see complaint above unlike my fair lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully <UNK> us the singing voice of oliver reed <UNK> if i'm mistaken it's been a while br br my biggest complaint i've stated why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story seldom has this been done to good effect generally it ruins the story it did with this one <UNK> still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that <UNK> about it's impossible to tell
<START> poor <UNK> though to the manner born she had the bad luck to marry a charming <UNK> richard <UNK> as the movie is set in the <UNK> or 30s when rigid victorian ideas of class were starting to <UNK> at the edges this uncertain status <UNK> her <UNK> the <UNK> for so they are called don't know where their next <UNK> is coming from but there are <UNK> parties and fancy dress balls in posh <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> her when <UNK> joan fontaine makes the <UNK> of a wealthy older <UNK> herbert marshall who must have been born middle aged she sets one of her <UNK> <UNK> for him luckily one of the <UNK> she still strings along <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> whose <UNK> rooms provide a <UNK> of poison with which she <UNK> her <UNK> farewell the fact that it <UNK> <UNK> doesn't phase her a bit even as the hours <UNK> by until he should be <UNK> by the neck until dead the turning of the plot depends on police inspector sir cedric <UNK> <UNK> mother the <UNK> <UNK> watson and <UNK> loyal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sam wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama <UNK> <UNK> face supplies the rest
<START> when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not it was not scary at all acting was good plot was horrible the military <UNK> was just plain stupid i think the sci fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap the movie made it sound like <UNK> was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible one out of 10 max im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this beyond <UNK> <UNK> was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci fi channel is better than this movie
<START> <UNK> fox whilst generally <UNK> on the <UNK> side of israeli politics has made several quite interesting films in the past such as walk on water and the simply wonderful film <UNK> jagger in the bubble however he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme br br far from giving this film a standing <UNK> the people at the screening i attended quietly got up and left i also quietly left <UNK> with anger at such a ridiculously one sided film that <UNK> self <UNK> as racist bullying and racist bullying and terrorism as <UNK> of justified anger which implies that <UNK> are so <UNK> by the evil <UNK> that they react in anger to a constant stream of one sided israeli <UNK> against them and that they therefore should not be held responsible for their actions br br this film wasn't worth the money i paid for the ticket indeed i considered demanding my money back and was basically an israeli <UNK> of the palestinian film paradise now if you want to be an anti israeli then by all means watch this film as it really <UNK> just such a belief system the fact that this film was made by an israeli director and even worse such a talented israeli director is a crying shame indeed just how israel can be surprised to be regarded as a <UNK> state when <UNK> themselves make such anti israel propaganda <UNK> belief br br what a shameful horrid little film
<START> i love the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> really <UNK> i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life and these high ratings really <UNK> me that <UNK> happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers br br may be spoiler br br an educated girl needs an advice from a <UNK> people discussing their personal <UNK> on phones come on man from which part of the world u r i agree that films should be <UNK> but these things are really <UNK> br br 2 out of 10 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting

two other men soon after taker <UNK> out of the ring and the rock <UNK> with angle angle gave a series of <UNK> that took down rock but the great one <UNK> with a <UNK> that managed a two count the fight continued outside the ring with taker coming to life and <UNK> angle and repeatedly <UNK> the rock taker and rock got into it back into the ring and taker dropped the rock with a sidewalk slam

<START> morgan freeman and paz vega are the <UNK> pair who get in the car and go about doing <UNK> according to the need of one or the other morgan freeman is superbly human relating with one and all while paz vega is the edgy <UNK> behind the 10 items or less check out line <UNK> customers and bored out of her mind together they explore discover and learn from each other to do that of course they must be vulnerable interested in change and have a sense of humour all of which they both have i wish this film was realistic i wish this type of story happened more often i wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds the film's message is based in the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there a world where peace could be a possibility
<START> i began watching this movie with my girl friend and after 5 minutes i was alone br br i succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful experience br br i liked jean <UNK> <UNK> but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie br br there are only 5 characters and the rest could be called <UNK> or something that i couldn't express but that i didn't understand at all br br the only worst movie i saw was crash but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again br br good luck o
<START> i have to say as a bsg fan i wasn't exactly sure what i'd think of this show i saw it on the big screen at the <UNK> cinema tonight as part of the <UNK> center <UNK> and the cast and film makers spoke after <UNK> ron moore said they <UNK> to make a clean break from battlestar and do something different and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others br br even without their talk i am now a fan of the new show but here's what i thought of the film br br i loved it it was really very good i guess i'm a true sci fi or <UNK> do i really have to type that geek because i'd totally watch this as a series it has a strong and rich story and kept my interest br br it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing the actor playing ben should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs the actress playing <UNK> seemed a little <UNK> but she was playing a teenager and i'm sure i won't be the only one who thought <UNK> was a <UNK> at first <UNK> of being a bsg geek if they're hoping these will be the new <UNK> <UNK> park they may want to <UNK> it surprisingly it was the adults that captured the audiences attention br br eric <UNK> gives a stellar performance as daniel <UNK> a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people especially in a scene in which he <UNK> a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters traps her then <UNK> and releases her no sign at all of the <UNK> <UNK> he played on <UNK> <UNK> really impressive acting br br equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is paula <UNK> as his wife amanda <UNK> she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as <UNK> part and i completely believed that they are a couple and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship something rarely seen these days i look forward to seeing what happens with this family and hope they give her as much to do as <UNK> in bsg she is strong and smart and when she <UNK> out at her kid you cringe it's really great not to mention her eyes which could hold magical powers that's how intense they are the scene where she takes on the government agent very short scene but beautifully played really gives you an idea of her power br br the other part of the show that did not work 100 for me were the scenes with <UNK> <UNK> and the mafia type clan of his he does a good job overall but i did not believe in this <UNK> power nor <UNK> by their <UNK> i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out the way it is presented is almost an homage to the godfather they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit but given time i can see how this will develop into an interesting <UNK> <UNK> kind of thing with the poor <UNK> <UNK> et al versus the rich folk who rule the planet <UNK> et al and to be honest i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name that was a very well played scene br br note to bsg fans the boy playing <UNK> <UNK> doesn't really look much like <UNK> but he's just a kid whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film who knows i sure couldn't tell but it didn't bother me because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him br br polly walker plays <UNK> <UNK> and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in i'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with but i was very impressed with her acting in this film she was sort of on the side but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on she was nothing like her character in rome something i always find impressive in actors br br one nice surprise the music is actually better and less obvious than bsg even though it's the same guy doing it bear <UNK> it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise i'd buy this score if i had the chance br br as to the <UNK> <UNK> after the show it was <UNK> by seth green ron moore was very smart and <UNK> david <UNK> was cracking wise much like his video <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> told a long story about how he was cast and eric <UNK> was very funny and didn't really answer the questions but i've always had a thing for him paula <UNK> was tough she took seth green to task for <UNK> saying she was on <UNK> and the girls who played <UNK> and <UNK> were both darling grace park and <UNK> <UNK> were there as well answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on bsg overall a very interesting and wonderful evening br br i'm giving the show a 9 out of 10 and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold br br note i just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the <UNK> was originally made for i have no idea what that may be but it holds a great deal of fascination to me
<START> the idea behind this film was a good one too bad it wasn't written well casting sidney <UNK> as the fbi agent was a good idea and he did an outstanding job tom berenger on the other hand only knows one emotion in most of his movies anger <UNK> <UNK> character could have been a great one and even showed some possibilities once but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be i don't care for <UNK> acting anyway the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did the director <UNK> the cow dry before the unbelievable final action i will keep this in my collection only as an example of <UNK> performances
<START> from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the <UNK> i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters <UNK> the fox and its friendship with the child who <UNK> it played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the story's frankly quite simple and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children <UNK> animals striking a friendship after the development of trust and how they go about hanging around each other dealing with respective <UNK> and the likes here the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains which provide for plenty of beautiful picture <UNK> perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into <UNK> to capture br br but while we <UNK> in <UNK> scenery the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the <UNK> and we have to wait a few seasons to past and 45 minutes into the film before they find a <UNK> in food the child <UNK> attempts at striking a bond with the objective of <UNK> the creature for her own amusement but the fox well as other notions of course while i thought the narrative was pretty weak unlike march of the <UNK> which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen what <UNK> here were the documentary elements of the movie <UNK> the life and times of the fox as both a predator and a prey br br between the two more tension and drama was given to the latter especially when dealing with traditional <UNK> like wolves and granted those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got <UNK> in it otherwise it was plain <UNK> and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other in shots that you know have <UNK> some movie magic editing there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren't really quite suitable for children as those in the same hall <UNK> to it by <UNK> their eyes out suddenly so parents you might want to take note and not let your <UNK> <UNK> the rest of the movie goers br br as a film i would've preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the <UNK> but i guess the way it was <UNK> probably had the objective of warning us not to <UNK> with nature and that some things are just not meant to be and should stay as such decent movie that <UNK> on the strength of the chemistry between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the multiple <UNK> that played <UNK>
<START> this movie is bad news and i'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this i imagine there were a few <UNK> agents <UNK> across hollywood <UNK> as a result of this fiasco what really gets you is that it could have been good the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales but this is a flop the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end and you end up feeling like a mouse in a <UNK> looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him as the movie does quite a number on <UNK> outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical <UNK> he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and <UNK> you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes but the question remains can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere
<START> despite being a 2001 movie the direction is the kind of 90's art house style that was considered old and out of date a few years ago the cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch the script is decent enough and a few scenes did kind of <UNK> me like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night but the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible the performance by the actor who plays <UNK> <UNK> married boyfriend seriously bothered me i did sit through the whole thing though which is rare for the kind of random what is this movie you just find on tv and decide to watch
<START> this film is in short a cinematic masterpiece the film is moved along brilliantly by intense images that deeply move the sensitive viewer the film opens during the spanish civil war as a group of children seek their revenge on another child in fact they are acting out in their world a version of what they have witnessed in the adult world around them later we meet three of these children again as adults at a <UNK> here we see what life has <UNK> on each of them one is a <UNK> sexually repressed patient another man is a hustler who has become ill the third child a young lady has become a nun and is serving at the <UNK> this film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche br br this film has a climax that is definitely not for the <UNK> members of the viewing audience but it is logical as well as profoundly moving the acting is excellent and the script is quite well written there is a musical score that provides an <UNK> of dread throughout this film this is not a film for thrill <UNK> but a film for a thoughtful audience
<START> it's hard to say which comes out on top james <UNK> charm and energy or the mouth opening <UNK> of busby <UNK> three grand <UNK> at the close i give it a tie with <UNK> parade one of the funniest and <UNK> of the early thirties musicals although the movie clearly belongs to cagney joan blondell adds <UNK> to the good natured story line br br and what's the story line it's about <UNK> kent cagney who produces musicals and who now is just about out of business as the <UNK> take over he starts doing <UNK> live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts he gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them moving them around the country he's a ball of fire and ideas and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things but a rival is <UNK> on him and stealing his ideas <UNK> <UNK> blondell his wise cracking secretary loves him but he's too busy too notice an office girl in black <UNK> round glasses ruby keeler wants a chance to dance his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all a blonde gold <UNK> is setting her <UNK> in him his partners are cheating him my gosh what's next this may all sound like a lot to <UNK> but everything happens fast with cagney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> finger <UNK> <UNK> orders and occasionally until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing doing a step or two just to show how it's done br br instead of let's put on a show gang we have we need to build three shows in three days so lock the doors and let's start <UNK> these three super <UNK> are going to feature 40 <UNK> spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract with forty kent <UNK> in <UNK> movie houses the whole apollo movie house circuit <UNK> threatens feet <UNK> but all those <UNK> <UNK> in skimpy costumes which include ann <UNK> and dorothy <UNK> you can quickly spot <UNK> but <UNK> is more generic stay the course dancing their hearts out <UNK> and <UNK> and looking remarkably <UNK> br br and then the <UNK> go up as each prologue is presented in separate movie houses one after the other on the same night with the owner of the apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save <UNK> skin or not br br first up is honeymoon hotel with dick powell and ruby keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome <UNK> with brides and <UNK> some might even be married <UNK> and <UNK> and doors with do not <UNK> signs br br then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of by a <UNK> that probably had the warner brothers <UNK> worrying about <UNK> this number is so excessive dozens of swimming girls trees <UNK> a huge <UNK> with <UNK> a giant pool you'd never think there was a depression on berkeley pulls out all his tricks <UNK> human <UNK> legs and arms doing all sorts of <UNK> things and he does it in the water with a lot of underwater photography looking up the girls are sure game they come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks the whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and <UNK> ruby keeler who has a couple of quick shots in the water is the only one who looks a bit <UNK> br br and finally the smash finale 11 minutes of cagney dancing and singing with keeler to shanghai <UNK> with all sorts of bar girls and their customers unusual in that the races are mixed up there's cagney and keeler dancing on the bar dancing on a table cagney fighting there are what looks like fifty or sixty <UNK> marines <UNK> back and forth <UNK> tossed and caught then this is true a human picture forms of franklin <UNK> and the <UNK> eagle this may be the only hollywood musical production that has ever featured <UNK> a big federal agency and a <UNK> of sexy chinese prostitutes br br that's entertainment folks it's great br br of course <UNK> <UNK> get the big contract and <UNK> gets <UNK> the movie is full of <UNK> clichés that make us smile ruby keeler is so endearing as she <UNK> <UNK> out her <UNK> with her arms flying that you want to help her along joan blondell makes us forget about a lot of hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality the movie however belongs to cagney who grabs and shakes it and to berkeley a man for whom too much was never too much
<START> this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated <UNK> character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug it's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didn't make use of it i didn't feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the <UNK> in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the <UNK> computers it is my opinion and that's all it is that if the <UNK> factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly <UNK> this film would have been good
<START> i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this it is a movie that makes fun of fat people has no real story has bad actors is not funny and much more is this a movie that you would like to see i guess not br br i guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all the so called funny parts is as funny as <UNK> <UNK> in the faces of people or breaking wind of <UNK> if this is the kind of humour that you like then this is the movie for you br br dont waste your money on this movie
<START> you believe in god or you don't you believe in jesus or you don't you believe he is the son of god or you don't the choice is up to you br br director <UNK> <UNK> has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure social worker son of two humans instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary who opened heaven again for us <UNK> the big bang a world come from evolution instead of seeing the beauty of creation the film depicts a <UNK> bringing some modern <UNK> to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play who happily <UNK> them in his play br br the depicted priest who runs the <UNK> where the passion play is performed in <UNK> has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through <UNK> more often than not the director's <UNK> of the church is clearly visible br br the director has tried to make a parallel between <UNK> life and the passion play actor's life this is an admirable attempt but depicting the <UNK> with the <UNK> of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies <UNK> how the director thinks about jesus br br my opinion is not important god's opinion is but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before <UNK> throne
<START> this movie was for a while in my collection but it wasn't before a friend of mine reminded me about it  until i decided that i should watch it i did not know much about close to leo  just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic  aids br br although the person who has aids  is leo  the scenario <UNK> around the way in which marcel the youngest brother of leo <UNK> with the sickness of his relative at first everyone is trying to hide the truth from marcel  he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother  the fact that leo is also a homosexual contributes to the <UNK> of the parents to <UNK> the matter with the young marcel i know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves with exception of the fact that the family tried to <UNK> the truth from marcel they have left quite an impression for me  the way they supported their son  even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness the fact that they allowed the young marcel to travel along with leo to paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from <UNK> most families i know will be reluctant to do that there is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together  you can see them being real friends concern about each other br br close to leo is an excellent drama which i strongly recommend
<START> just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself seriously even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen never bothered to post a comment on here before but this piece of crap really <UNK> it br br firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical brother of the lead character either ben or arthur i forget which is which and frankly it's never very clear wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight because homosexuality is <UNK> to christians but apparently mass murder isn't then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay <UNK> ex wife trying to force him to <UNK> her at <UNK> this leads to nothing but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole film i don't make sense you don't make sense that's who makes sense brilliant br br then there's the acting which is just atrocious it must be seen to be believed my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman who is clearly reading her lines off of something yet still managing to mess them up enough said the gay couple couldn't be less convincing there's the vaguely attractive and completely <UNK> guy and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon <UNK> man of the <UNK> <UNK> only <UNK> and less talented br br the film has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on yep br br but anyways we all know how terrible this thing is so i'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the film provides br br when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then <UNK> like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape hilarious br br <UNK> no idea what relation she is to the main characters sometimes they know her sometimes they don't but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless hilarious br br the stoned lawyer already mentioned her but she's so funny she's worth another mention br br the evil brothers dinner of <UNK> that he lays on for his guests br br the evil brother's anti gay <UNK> br br the evil brother's cats br br the ending which i won't give away because it must be seen to be believed i warn you though make sure you're not eating at the time the <UNK> of <UNK> main character director producer gets naked it's foul br br basically ben and arthur is <UNK> bad but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time literally nothing is good about this excuse for a film the <UNK> of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times
<START> astonishing screams the la times from the front of the dvd box they must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released the film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive their skin <UNK> off throughout the film we also see severed legs heads etc that are about as convincing as a halloween fuzzy felt set there is an awful lot of talking b ll <UNK> a bit of human <UNK> and some weird zombie hunter <UNK> who <UNK> the <UNK> of said skin illness in his closet <UNK> to a chair before stabbing them in the head <UNK> them into bits br br you get the picture considering there is no acting talent on display at all and the gore is laughably unrealistic what is the point of this whole <UNK> again looking at the video box the guy responsible for it is an underground cult director would that be like those weird religious <UNK> where they <UNK> you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true because that's the only possible reason i can think of for anyone to <UNK> pleasure by watching this tax write off then on the same paragraph he <UNK> himself to mike leigh ken <UNK> and george romero <UNK> oh stop it now you're just being silly br br do you enjoy this film are you offended by the above opinion if so you must be a member of said cult do they pocket your <UNK> do they let you see other family members do they force you to watch andrew <UNK> films till you think he's the best director since a hitchcock do tell this sounds like a <UNK> special <UNK> to me and say hello to the critic of the la times when you return to your colony will you 0 10
<START> before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars eventually i even <UNK> going for that reason plot is almost non existent character development is non existent so many clichés and so much jaw dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released if not for the <UNK> i wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1 an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members in fact the movie's plot is so predictable and simple minded that an average child could <UNK> the majority of the storyline bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad movie br br don't see it play <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead and it'll <UNK> your <UNK> for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality of the product i did rent this one back in the eighties and i remember it to be good but not great movie i've always liked michael keaton's style and delivery he was a perfect fit for the movie br br i am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie i grant you yes it's no oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value it's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all out comedy farce i also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences i beg to <UNK> i grant you again that there are a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> but then again this is hollywood film not a documentary from what i've read about differences between <UNK> on both sides of the pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time br br some of the basic differences were that japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole <UNK> was <UNK> they perhaps made the company above all else where american workers had more of a management <UNK> labor type of relationship the individual was more important than the company i'll probably get some hate email over that comment i'm sure br br another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix in many japanese plants <UNK> or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers meaning car dealer problem br br many of these things are probably dated but i'm sure some are still around as many us car makers are still struggling to keep up with the japanese if one is more interested in the subject of american european and japanese <UNK> i can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period the book is called the machine that changed the world by james <UNK> daniel jones and daniel <UNK> it's about a study of <UNK> during and before the time period that this movie covers parts are bit dry but i think you'll find that it backs up much the movie also
<START> i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv shows i saw universal trademark followed with a newly <UNK> title and theme song which still impress me computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name the <UNK> or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic shortly after that till the end i couldn't believe my eyes how lucky i was that i could forget all i had seen just songs by <UNK> and its theme song in new <UNK> were in my head anyway i wish to see this space aged family also the <UNK> and <UNK> bear in all graphic computer design as toy story or bug's life the best style for <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion
<START> lee chang <UNK> exceptional secret sunshine is the single most emotionally <UNK> experience of the year it is an instantly <UNK> brutally honest character piece on the <UNK> of loss and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> with a striking <UNK> of thought yet remains as <UNK> as the emotions it <UNK> through its layered <UNK> and stunningly <UNK> view of small town dynamics lee <UNK> <UNK> the traditional korean melodrama by pulling apart the <UNK> of excess and ripping to <UNK> the <UNK> that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a <UNK> <UNK> of stoic realism br br secret sunshine remains an immensely compelling fluid work throughout its <UNK> minute runtime its <UNK> first hour is filled to the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> remarkable <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of tone brought about by <UNK> <UNK> adapted from a short story lee <UNK> the film with his sensitivity for the sublime <UNK> of life last seen in his <UNK> comic and <UNK> <UNK> understanding how personal <UNK> are <UNK> when views of our universe are changed lee not only sees the emotional <UNK> of a <UNK> sorrow through an <UNK> scope but also feels the <UNK> existential <UNK> that <UNK> the film when religion becomes a narrative <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> of the human experience br br do <UNK> <UNK> you are my sunshine best actress <UNK> at cannes in 2007 is well deserved her performance as the widow shin <UNK> remains an <UNK> <UNK> as a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control the sheer <UNK> of this performance is central to the film's <UNK> nature with <UNK> <UNK> one <UNK> <UNK> after another there's a <UNK> sense of collapse that the film to its credit never approaches instead it finds a delicate balance that <UNK> the charged <UNK> and subsequent <UNK> from ordinary <UNK> and its <UNK> she becomes the centre of the film's universe as well as <UNK> filmed in glorious hand held <UNK> the film <UNK> the <UNK> of frames and compositions by becoming visually <UNK> just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never <UNK> its <UNK> from shin <UNK> through times of happiness guilt and <UNK> br br lee captures the details of life in the small suspicious town of <UNK>  the <UNK> of <UNK> situations its uncomfortable <UNK> and its <UNK> <UNK> out of personal dramas shin <UNK> interactions with the <UNK> rarely <UNK> <UNK> especially when they are merely done out of <UNK> to fit in for the sake of her son <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the one recurring <UNK> is <UNK> chan song <UNK> ho a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to <UNK> in the film's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of <UNK> song has <UNK> himself as a comedic anti hero in south <UNK> biggest films but his nuanced low key delivery here <UNK> the director's thought process of never having to reveal more than <UNK> necessary br br if pain is <UNK> then grief can never truly <UNK> and lee finds complexity in <UNK> when shin <UNK> attempts to head down the path of <UNK> only to be faced again with <UNK> <UNK> she <UNK> employs the <UNK> of <UNK> christianity as a foil to her sorrow but lee knows better than that when he understands that religion in the context of the human <UNK> of <UNK> and misery is never a simple solution but lee never <UNK> the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others the scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn't allow itself to become <UNK> <UNK> which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters br br lee's first film since his call to office as his country's minister of culture and <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> on human suffering in a film so <UNK> and genuine it <UNK> reveals that there's nothing as simple as emotional <UNK> just the <UNK> and <UNK> of agony secret sunshine leaves us with tender <UNK> pulled out of <UNK> and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith
<START> you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great the premise of <UNK> needing blood is just dopey br br the script is <UNK> the actors don't have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs it's a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budget br br lack of budget is okay if there's a story <UNK> and blood of <UNK> are examples of decent work from no but this movie looks as if they had to <UNK> their change together just to buy the cameraman a <UNK> again forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck br br finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesn't finish it simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just odd br br just bad
<START> the story is seen before but that <UNK> matter if you can figure out to make a proper <UNK> it is clear that the director haven't spent his work on the <UNK> alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time <UNK> angles that do not match the message of the movie the funniest is however if you take a look at the movie's website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles because it remind us about hunting but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles it will have 1 stars because the story is ok it is a pity that <UNK> west has not spent more time to review his story it is as if the movie was more important than the planning because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away come everyone can make a movie but not all will be just as good so a word of advice to <UNK> west are stop and <UNK> what you want use your time to start planning and not filming until everything has come down on a <UNK> you certainly have the ability and desire so don't abuse your talent
<START> i did not expect a lot from this movie after the terrible life is a miracle it turns out that this movie is ten times worse than life i have impression that director writer is just joking with the audience let me see how much <UNK> can you audience sustain dialogues are empty scenario is <UNK> in few moments photography is really nice few sarcastic lines are semi funny but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this comedy i've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end if you can lift yourself above this director's fiasco you will find good acting of few legends <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and very good performance of <UNK> son <UNK> kusturica br br in short too bad for such a great director <UNK> kusturica is still young and should be making top rated movies instead he chooses to do this low budget just for my private theater movie with arrogant attitude toward the world <UNK> and <UNK> toward his old fans
<START> i'd read about flavia the <UNK> for many years but i only got to see it early last year when i went on an insane movie buying <UNK> and for whatever reason it has been on my mind lately though it's been some months since i watched it br br it's a striking film set in italy somewhere around the <UNK> century definitely medieval era though i don't think any specific year is ever given this being the time of christian <UNK> the age is a time of utter madness and the movie captures this very well br br flavia our protagonist is a young lady who encounters a fallen muslim on a battlefield he seems a warm and intriguing fellow and she's immediately taken with him her father a soldier of a a family of some standing comes along almost immediately and murders the wounded man right before her eyes but she'll continue to see him in her dreams br br her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open air insane asylum the residents so <UNK> repressed by <UNK> medieval christianity slowly go mad flavia comes under the influence of one of the <UNK> nuns but in a mad world only the sane are truly mad and this <UNK> sister clearly <UNK> the insanity around her her take on the times in which they live strikes a <UNK> with flavia who being young and apparently <UNK> is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped br br the movie is <UNK> in its portrayal of that world <UNK> a lot of <UNK> we see a horse <UNK> a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig <UNK> the <UNK> torture of a young nun through it all flavia <UNK> and questions <UNK> eventually the christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming <UNK> i disagree with that criticism <UNK> views though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror for example then contemporary feminist commentary the movie was made in 1974 <UNK> around what are really pretty obvious questions it is perhaps difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time but that's the sort of minor point it doesn't do to <UNK> flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era or of any era to empathize with her plight getting <UNK> down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees br br flavia is <UNK> when the muslims arrive <UNK> the countryside and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome <UNK> who still visits her dreams smitten with her almost immediately he allows her to virtually lead his army becoming a joan of arc figure in full battle gear and directing the <UNK> to pull down christian society and <UNK> vengeance upon all those she's seen commit evil br br is she the <UNK> of a new and better world she may think so but muslims of that era weren't big on <UNK> either as she soon learns the hard way as they say meet the new boss br br this is really just a <UNK> of some of the things that happen in flavia the <UNK> the movie is quite grim and with a very downbeat rather depressing ending not a mass audience movie at all to be sure it's quite good though and doesn't belong on the <UNK> pile on which it is often <UNK> thrown i think there's much value in the final film and i'm glad i saw it
<START> home alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies it's the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like battlefield earth and <UNK> <UNK> rock vegas in fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least <UNK> made me laugh at their stupidity this just made me cringe in pain constantly and <UNK> when the credits started rolling no other movie has made me cringe in pain now i will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious br br first off the plot is ridiculous it revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it dumb stuff br br the action that ensues is similar to that of the other two home <UNK> with <UNK> and all but watching these <UNK> being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch i didn't laugh or even so much as smile once rather i <UNK> constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid the bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying br br the acting as done by a bunch of no names <UNK> from poor to atrocious there is not a single good performance here alex d <UNK> is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they've been <UNK> picked off the street and well that's it br br i can see some people saying man it's for the kids don't <UNK> it man well man kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better see monsters inc and toy story before even considering getting this out hell even scooby doo and garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this br br so in short this is an <UNK> atrocious movie this was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well no human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see home alone 3 ever it's that bad br br 0 5 stars
<START> i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her <UNK> of him i was wrong it was a cinema <UNK> of betty hits the beach <UNK> for the first part by <UNK> <UNK> i really don't care what young <UNK> from scotland do these days who <UNK> screw what drugs they take visually the <UNK> through the <UNK> de <UNK> in <UNK> was pleasant and surely the high point for me the <UNK> was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts 1 that's all there is 2 now i see why her boyfriend killed himself <UNK> it bare bitch boredom or what i did on my trip to spain i'm such a sucker for sticking these things out
<START> i don't understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made br br cartoon characters abound <UNK> foul mouthed alcoholic <UNK> irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for <UNK> asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are i've no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a <UNK> creep like bob but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep <UNK> on about how realistic it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film br br i didn't like the film at all
<START> all i can say is if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie then you're not human even after watching it for the first time i was hooked it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe as i'm sure other fans will <UNK> to after watching it you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us at least we have grey gardens to remember them i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were <UNK> with although i have always admired jackie <UNK> kennedy she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had
<START> this movie started me on a nick cage kick it is a story full of twists and turns a movie of motives and moves of course dennis hopper was a ham but j t walsh and laura <UNK> boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web everything about this movie is good cinematography story pace and most of all the end cage excels at what he does best it's not to be an action hero but to be an <UNK> caught in the <UNK> of life
<START> what if <UNK> monroe albert einstein joe <UNK> and senator mccarthy were to come together in a mind <UNK> evening of <UNK> br br this delightful roman <UNK> <UNK> never uses the actual names of the characters it so <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> exposes not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time if you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up <UNK> and <UNK> you won't like this film it is a demanding <UNK> that <UNK> on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it br br dropping for the time being the <UNK> <UNK> of using the real names of the characters we see einstein about to deliver a <UNK> speech to a united nations hell bent for <UNK> being visited by <UNK> monroe after filming the notorious seven year <UNK> scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with joe <UNK> they have a lovely interplay in which einstein stumbles with suitable <UNK> <UNK> around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times br br enter senator mccarthy who thinks einstein is a red he is determined to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he will support the activities of the house <UNK> activities <UNK> while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace add joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as gary busey who hates <UNK> <UNK> and believes einstein has become her lover even though <UNK> only wants to show einstein that she understands the special theory of <UNK> br br but there's more br br just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today finally we see the shocking terror of <UNK> vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear it is a powerful and memorable moment br br <UNK> is one of my top five movies of all time it is utterly amazing
<START> i can only agree with <UNK> that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in <UNK> not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and that's always good unless it's just <UNK> was <UNK> i loved this film you just don't get to see <UNK> like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
<START> what a mess why was this movie made this and other movies of its caliber should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie children may like it but anyone over 10 may or will <UNK> to make matters worse was the fact that such great talent like whoopi goldberg and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were entirely wasted in a film <UNK> of any notice
<START> this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be <UNK> that art heist doesn't add anything to the genre director bryan <UNK> has no clue what to do with the film br br william baldwin keeps <UNK> in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks <UNK> by that strange <UNK> he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the <UNK> and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen <UNK> his leading lady doesn't fare much better there is no chemistry between ms <UNK> and mr baldwin br br a movie to be seen at the viewer's own risk
<START> when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i've ever seen yes it was funny i mean i liked it all until the end where oh no i can't tell u should it for yourself it is funny except the vulgar language that's why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it but if not don't <UNK> <UNK> money on renting it or buying it
<START> dudley moore is fantastic in this <UNK> unknown classic this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent without dudley moore john gielgud <UNK> minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood the psycho like music at the wedding fight but the acting <UNK> it the character arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments but he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will the end is fairly corny though i wont give it away but it could be improved worth seeing many times
<START> henry <UNK> was daring as well as enthusiastic for his love of the people of the early days in us history however to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about <UNK> young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film in my opinion <UNK> did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints during the time period beginning with the <UNK> of joseph smith to the date of film release in often subtle filming and dialog delivery he covered mormon <UNK> and <UNK> in many of the segments and scenes br br i remember watching this movie on many saturday <UNK> during my youth in the early 1950's that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed which i watched being constructed and <UNK> more curious wonder of who <UNK> were i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that <UNK> interpreted in his film br br 1 love for all people regardless of their personal beliefs 2 charity to those in need or not 3 family is high in importance 4 listen <UNK> and carefully because even <UNK> messages have important points to consider and adopt 5 work hard both <UNK> and in community 6 prepare and store for future days of need 7 hope is a <UNK> link to a higher being and for our daily lives 8 and that there is a unique quality to any group and appreciate those that are identified as <UNK>
<START> as an ordinary movie watcher i can't say i enjoyed watching this one it's not too emotional for a drama not too gripping for a thriller not too fast for an action plus some moments of the movie are hardly credible ok i understand soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life <UNK> into the middle of a hostile city and after being <UNK> at by a <UNK> wife run away without having asked a question in a proper way it would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so but it's supposed to be a serious film about war there are several episodes like this so the whole picture makes an impression that it's just a raw preview of a movie and it needs considerable work br br it feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier but all these <UNK> of his psychology seem simply unnatural br br this picture left a question in my head why why they gave it an oscar why six and imho it's the most thrilling part of the movie
<START> <UNK> drives the bus is simply the funniest most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing br br this movie is by no means up to hollywood standards or even that of a straight to video movie fluff comedy starring terry hulk hogan in terms of camera work editing acting budget or anything else br br what this movie does have though is a very original and enjoyable story and it is obviously done by people who love making it and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting <UNK> br br this movie proves that you don't need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing br br simply the best movie ever i don't care how you get it rent it order it steal it <UNK> it just see this movie br br now i just hope they make a dvd version
<START> i tried to like this slasher like i try to enjoy all slasher films i mean mindless <UNK> mixed with a little nudity and some suspense how can you go wrong but unhinged i think is an example of that formula going wrong the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house it was as if they were under <UNK> and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight the film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction <UNK> it of those and leaves the movie pretty dull it's a shame because if the movie was better executed it would have have been ace the story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and <UNK> humorous moments of interaction between the mother the girls and the daughter in the old house there's some good nudity and occasional <UNK> <UNK> just not enough to give the film the kick it needed the finale is pretty twisted and <UNK> and does give the film a big lift but sadly its too little too late so in my opinion one to avoid unless you really love obscure slasher films there's a fair amount of potential but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile
<START> samuel fuller is hardly one of america's great directors i'm not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood's great <UNK> but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood's true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the <UNK> material handed to him and then turn it quickly and <UNK> into something usually better than its parts on time and on budget pickup on south street is a case in point on the surface it's one more of hollywood's early <UNK> anti <UNK> movies complete with appeals to <UNK> a hard boiled hero and a slimy and <UNK> <UNK> bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichés into a taut exciting drama with any number of off <UNK> twists the hero skip mccoy is a three time loser a petty crook with soft fingers who doesn't change his <UNK> until the very end the girl in the caper candy has a level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you're so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is a <UNK> and in an unusual approach to hollywood's battle against <UNK> the appeals to <UNK> fall on deaf ears the hero isn't motivated by anything so <UNK> he just wants <UNK> for a personal reason and winds up becoming at least for now a good guy br br plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is a surprise she gives a fine portrait of a woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends or her <UNK> want her to be and richard <UNK> who later would become a two time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly <UNK> and cowardly it's hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us i mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la <UNK> br br more than anything else this tale of a <UNK> who picks a purse in a subway car and finds himself with <UNK> secrets instead of cash pursued by the <UNK> and the <UNK> moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with a classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly <UNK> hard boiled pulp fiction style that <UNK> you <UNK> she's okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of a sudden the story <UNK> up to a whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad <UNK> br br the thing i like best about the movie is how the opening <UNK> <UNK> talents and strengths in 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters skip and candy we're going to be involved with and he does this with so much <UNK> curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us br br says glenn <UNK> in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an <UNK> story sam fuller <UNK> his peculiar view of <UNK> from the bottom up stiff <UNK> aggressive self interest that when fully expressed <UNK> what's wrong and what's right and isn't afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort he's right and it makes for a movie still vivid after <UNK> years
<START> what is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead <UNK> is in fact a head <UNK> inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being ginger rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building these characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean as a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around rogers and her lead man some guy i don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt honestly i've never had a worse time watching an old b rate movie of this type and i've seen some real head <UNK> br br oh and the butler didn't do it because there wasn't a butler but pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler there ya go br br <UNK>
<START> i'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is i like bad films as they are often the most entertaining i love bad special effects bad acting bad music and inept direction with the exception of the music which was better than i had expected this movie had all of those qualities br br the special effects were amazingly bad the worst i've seen since my <UNK> 64 some scenes to watch for include the <UNK> the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot the big ben scene the train wreck wow there are so many bad effects on the plus side though some scenes of the alien <UNK> are well done br br the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been having been based directly on h g <UNK> book for having such good source material it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over the top as to make it funny and then there's the mustache the single most distracting piece of facial hair i've seen in a long time of course only half the movie contains acting the rest is characters walking around <UNK> and poorly rendered effects shots br br to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors with the use of different colored <UNK> between shots for no particular reason the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes the bad green screening it's amazing to me how this man ever got <UNK> to direct a movie i wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie bravo mr hines bravo br br my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did have some friends who enjoy bad movies over drink play poker while watching it keep drinking and maybe you'll make it all the way through it does make for an excellent bad movie so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster
<START> my <UNK> for chris rock <UNK> with his movies i hated him after lethal weapon 4 but i hated everyone in that movie after it i like him when he is himself and not holding back like in dogma well this is his best yet wasn't expecting this to be that good laughed my <UNK> off the whole time chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy i've seen in quite some time loved it
<START> warning this review contains plot spoilers though nothing could spoil this movie any more than it already is it really is that bad br br before i begin i'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so incredibly bad that you fall over laughing movies if you're in a lighthearted mood and need a very <UNK> laugh this is the movie for you now without further <UNK> my review br br this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal mart that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is secondly it stars the lame action star dolph lundgren that should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is i'm still shocked that it was even put on dvd who would waste their money doing such a thing though as you might imagine there aren't any extras or bonus footage on the dvd in fact there's not even a menu the movie just starts playing br br first the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed it has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one liners remarkably unbelievable fake dialogue and inappropriate comments like lee's comment on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which i'll mention later there isn't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie the dialogue and plot go hand in hand as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion the two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning and then for again no reason at all lee's character pulls over to the side of the road runs around to the other side of the car and says i'm not going to let you go alone 'cause despite myself i like you and i don't want to see you get killed ' or something to that extent anyhow there are disgusting one liners mostly said by lee for instance when <UNK> it out with a bad guy lee says you have the right to remain silent you have the right to be dead ' lastly i'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that lee makes about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between lundgren and <UNK> and lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear lee says to him <UNK> we die i just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick i've ever seen on a guy ' yes he actually says that it makes no sense and isn't even possible lee never actually sees lundgren naked so how would he know but the writer threw it in the script anyway the entire movie looks like some kind of action video game and lee even admits it after lee and the underwear only lundgren defeat all of those bad guys lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful wow this is sort of like a video game we just defeated the first wave ' br br second the plot of this movie is despicable it suffers in my opinion mainly from the fact that it just doesn't exist the trailer for this movie which imdb has available for viewing by the way makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the japanese <UNK> from taking over lost angeles this is extremely misleading however since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all they make very brief vague references to the <UNK> trying to start up a <UNK> business with local drug dealers but the entire movie actually revolves around a poorly written attempt for <UNK> <UNK> character to revenge the death of his parents whom the <UNK> leader named <UNK> killed when he was only 9 years old the entire plot can basically be summed up like this <UNK> wants <UNK> dead <UNK> wants <UNK> dead and the two try two kill each other and of course all the while <UNK> sarcastic sidekick named johnny and played by brandon lee acts like an ignorant idiot and <UNK> <UNK> gets naked twice br br the acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie the dialogue is so unrealistic and their entirely <UNK> portrayal of it <UNK> this even more you'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway but this movie highlights some of the most <UNK> bad acting ever recorded br br finally we get to the heart of the movie's <UNK> the <UNK> bad action there are so many <UNK> bad unrealistic action sequences in this movie it's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in although lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well most of the truly terrible action involves lundgren for instance lundgren <UNK> takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one handed without <UNK> his tea then when surprised by an <UNK> <UNK> car lundgren casually leaps over it or how about when he reaches through a closed door grabs the villain on the other side pulls him back through the door and beats him up or when he picks up <UNK> <UNK> gently walks not runs <UNK> through a glass door that <UNK> around him and leaps down a one story height with <UNK> still in arm only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a <UNK> to shield them from bullets all of the shameless <UNK> are terrible as well with lundgren and lee killing every bad guy <UNK> while the rain of bullets from their fifty <UNK> never seem to hit either of them that is of course until the final fight scene of the movie lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart would still immediately begin to fill <UNK> with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds despite this lundgren remains in top notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with <UNK> the evil super villain and of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying real fully <UNK> <UNK> which the two use to sword fight now in addition to his bullet wound lundgren gets several deep <UNK> in his chest and arms does this stop him no of course not in fact a few seconds later after easily killing the evil <UNK> who gets <UNK> to a <UNK> like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason lundgren casually walks off with <UNK> and lee as if he wasn't injured at all god it's terrible br br all of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary gratuitous nude scene every five minutes including topless women at a party the <UNK> of a topless woman women at a strip club nude women at a japanese <UNK> and the pointless hot <UNK> and love scene with <UNK> not to mention the trip to the bizarre <UNK> bar at which rich japanese men are eating <UNK> off of naked women which by the way <UNK> lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after <UNK> the bad guys he and lundgren will go eat fish off those naked chicks ' which of course is followed by a disturbing high five and we can't forget the terrible editing either like when the villains are <UNK> a man trapped in a car at a junk yard and the <UNK> left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop <UNK> the credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers which implies that a lot of the action probably wasn't done by the movie stars after all br br in the end this movie repeatedly <UNK> it self with <UNK> badness it is illogical and impossible and as a result remarkably entertaining if you're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema this movie will make you want to die if you're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making this movie will delight you as an actual movie i'll merit this movie a 0 5 out of 10 as an entertaining way to waste an hour and <UNK> minutes however this beauty takes the cake
<START> when i first heard about the title i thought of 'the <UNK> just like so many other reviewers but when i saw the cast i was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in this first of all we have christopher walken deer hunter pulp fiction who plays the title character <UNK> he is rescued from a vietnam <UNK> camp by some of his buddies one of which is <UNK> chick <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> a hundred dollar bill with <UNK> vietnam soldiers are loaded with cash apparently and tells him that he can re do the favor to him if he ever gets into trouble br br then 18 years later <UNK> and his sister christina maria <UNK> <UNK> the running man predator 2 join the rebels in <UNK> trying to get rid of their evil dictator el <UNK> victor <UNK> taxi driver king of new york and when <UNK> fails the mission christina goes to <UNK> for help br br <UNK> then asks his good ol' vietnam buddies to help him first there's the token tough black guy <UNK> played by american ninja 's steve james who was also in director james <UNK> previous movie the <UNK> where the <UNK> real name also was <UNK> coincidence i think not there is also a lot of other references to the <UNK> among other things the most notable one being that <UNK> himself wears a <UNK> mask when christina sees him for the first time when he is working on a <UNK> job on top of a bridge br br the other guys in the vietnam pack are the rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team frank bruce michael <UNK> total recall starship troopers and then there's the doc dalton played by jay <UNK> who doesn't look like the guy the imdb is <UNK> to and i haven't seen him in other movies so who knows and last but not least there's the cop <UNK> who has had enough of his unsatisfying job he's played by thomas g <UNK> who some of us might remember from the warriors and the thing br br and in other big roles we find luis <UNK> boogie nights carlito's way as a small time drug dealer who can't get a decent job also there is dick <UNK> as the drug dealing <UNK> who gets hung up in a <UNK> on top of a roof by the <UNK> gang almost exactly in the same way he got hung up over a meat <UNK> by john <UNK> in the <UNK> movie now i haven't seen <UNK> <UNK> blue jean cop yet but i'm almost ready to bet half a hundred dollar bill that <UNK> gets hung up in that movie too br br well back to the plot of this movie they go off to <UNK> and saves the day <UNK> but who cares about the plot anyway the cast is great and the action scenes are very well done and you're never bored while watching this movie highly recommended to all action lovers
<START> savage <UNK> raw <UNK> will scare the hell out of you trust me br br when the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city <UNK> tourists <UNK> savage wants revenge and he'll stop at nothing until he gets it br br this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments br br also the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera work in order to reflect the dark murky and <UNK> mood of the story in other words to obtain a certain aesthetic br br in fact the film has won several horror film festival awards
<START> this is easily a 9 michel <UNK> known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career does a stunning even <UNK> stunning job of <UNK> dr <UNK> a legendary french serial killer br br he is just so believable at every and any moment in the film that the actor completely disappears behind the character only the very best ever achieve this feat and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at best br br the whole story a real story which happened in 20th century france is so powerful so sinister it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long long time
<START> every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you're a part of this country i guess <UNK> is such a movie br br you see the lowest level of <UNK> society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them <UNK> because they're doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of <UNK> art movies br br but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in <UNK> as the <UNK> of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner <UNK> in the same line maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why you'll try to get away but you cannot maybe you'll end up like them but it seems <UNK> for you because you're doing it through your whole life now br br life isn't so bright though <UNK> is one of the <UNK> countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of <UNK> has built up so far br br a very <UNK> movie
<START> my observations <UNK> outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful exotic and fantastic <UNK> wore it well and got even with naive nelson boat crashing into his balcony served him right costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well especially by today's standards 1942 costume designer did great job main song theme just lovely br br caution to negative posters 1942 was time of <UNK> ii pearl harbor happened year before u s just coming out of great depression needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on <UNK> of singing dance and yes fantastic fantasy <UNK> <UNK> were trying to rule out there in <UNK> <UNK> out <UNK> thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend movie going was a <UNK> treat in those depressing times when you negative posters become actors or even movie stars then you have room to talk and criticize <UNK> and <UNK> movies stand the test of time br br angel wings wonderful on the real angel <UNK> wings at costume party not so hot but great on <UNK> considering the <UNK> br br beautiful singing by <UNK> and nelson as always <UNK> dancing was a pure delight br br 15 10
<START> i am not an artistically inclined individual i am a science minded woman and i felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget i watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest my fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to <UNK> 13 but that is another story not to be <UNK> i <UNK> the next morning and gave the movie another shot i began again watching this movie in earnest i just don't get it i thought i would get it i thought the funniest part was the <UNK> of the <UNK> and the <UNK> finding a spot by the <UNK> being used as a <UNK> for what appeared to be dead flowers interesting and still it had dead stuff inside it was an odd and bizarre movie maybe this is what they were after however i won't be tricked a second time
<START> i bought this cheap from the rental <UNK> at our local store it was in almost <UNK> condition and i'd never heard of it before clearly nobody else had either br br i can't believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message the very moral and non <UNK> stance of the <UNK> party undoubtedly despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two <UNK> it was like a book one couldn't put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing <UNK> on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic i've seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book i'll treasure this little find until it wears out one day they'll make this again on a better budget br br
<START> i regret every single second of the time i lost while watching this movie really <UNK> i always find it hard to switch off a movie once i started watching it especially when it's such a classic or what people use to call a classic i think that this is one of those movies every movie lover should have watched at least one time so that was why i watched it don't get me wrong i like <UNK> bogart and his wife lauren bacall both as a couple and as actors but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion no really good plot neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story well not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether <UNK> and bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another i think to have and have not is very overrated and bogart was in many better films during the 1940s
<START> this sure is one comedy i'm not likely to forget for a while br br wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it's kind of popular in <UNK> sharing networks such as <UNK> and so this <UNK> production needs to be exposed for what it is br br so what is it then well of course it's not really a comedy instead it's intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here the script is a totally incoherent and <UNK> mess the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic and as for the acting well let's just say that if this had been my <UNK> play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent br br of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned also even though i'm a big fan of the horror genre i'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting br br but still br br b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances if you can find the humour in that and i could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually <UNK> off after that then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer oh that and two or three <UNK> of breasts br br <UNK> how exciting br br as for the story it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime the lesson watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done br br i rest my case br br so all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock <UNK> roll br br i rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if i could or perhaps i wouldn't it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles i mean that's something <UNK>
<START> it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase bakshi's work is quite true to the original work the visuals are <UNK> and sometimes haunting br br <UNK> occasionally the movie is confusing or muddled there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl but overall buy this movie it's great for kids adults and <UNK>
<START> probably somebody heard of <UNK> <UNK> a former policeman a former sky champion and now a terrible actor alex <UNK> was planned to be a tv mini serial but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels now it's a believe me ridiculous movie the script it's simply hilarious it's supposed to be a dramatic movie something like a 5 years old kid work but what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting <UNK> <UNK> who actually was not believable as a policeman himself plays terribly a totally silly character a special <UNK> italian policeman <UNK> in <UNK> doors open <UNK> is ram this super guy will try to save a young nice girl life an actual italian little tv <UNK> married to the singer <UNK> <UNK> nice but absolutely inept in the acting lose this one and make yourself a favour a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry only john travolta in earth attack got close
<START> perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone for some folks the idea of <UNK> down <UNK> and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell for others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists some part they long for contact with br br i suppose it's a function of where i am in my own life these days but i count myself in the camp of the latter group i found the <UNK> pace of this film almost hypnotic gently <UNK> me into some realm almost <UNK> this is indeed a journey story a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days br br much as been written of mr <UNK> presentation of alvin straight though i'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of <UNK> sadness and wise innocence he <UNK> for us knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own <UNK> as he sat on that <UNK> seat makes me wish i had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure i hope he had a small <UNK> of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people not just for acting but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty br br given the realities of production <UNK> i'm not sure full credit has been given mr lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly an <UNK> to film production i nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression time is money is so accurately <UNK> going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed and to his credit mr lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story he was <UNK> his viewers to spend some time with their own <UNK> no simple task that br br if you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with the straight story and then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night
<START> having to have someone hold your hand whenever walk up or down stairs having others taste your food before you eat it facing an over bearing mother these are only a few of the obstacles which the young victoria has to deal with in this film there's also the various power struggles going on as well as attempts on her life needless to say it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing br br i had only previously seen emily blunt in the devil wears <UNK> and little else as she was in that film she is once again the standout here i was extremely impressed with her portrayal of the young victoria and thought she handled the role very well she makes the transition from the young victoria we meet at the start of the film to the queen victoria she becomes later entirely believable blunt is perfectly cast in the role showing all the different sides from the vulnerable to the strong from the young victoria who makes mistakes to the queen who takes control not enough can be said about emily blunt in this role she's quite simply exquisite commanding your attention every second she's on screen she keeps you <UNK> up to and including the final shot of the film br br rupert friend proves to also be well cast as victoria's love interest and eventual husband prince albert the actors have nice chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship they have their <UNK> but you can tell that they are in love blunt and friend are excellent in every scene that they share and keep you interested in what is happening between victoria and albert the other actors in the film are also very good paul <UNK> as lord melbourne miranda richardson as the <UNK> of kent mark strong as sir john <UNK> and jim <UNK> as king william there is not a single bad performance in this film the less focused upon people are well portrayed also given what little screen time they have even victoria's dog a <UNK> king charles <UNK> named dash is memorable and makes an impact in the film br br although the movie does tend to skip more than a few aspects of victoria's life especially at the end and instead tells us what happened with her and albert on screen what matters the most is what we actually see this is after all a film about 'the young <UNK> not 'the middle aged <UNK> nor 'the old <UNK> while there are some <UNK> made on history with this film it remains focused on what it sets out to do which is tell us the story of how the young princess rose to power br br the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never <UNK> from it it's exceptionally shot and unlike a lot of films these days this movie is actually a good length as it doesn't run on so long that you lose interest or feel that it's needlessly being drawn out br br it goes without saying that what makes this film so great is emily blunt she's in fine form here turning in another excellent performance and <UNK> this film above what it might have been had another actress been cast in this rather important historic role this is one finely crafted film with excellent performances that should definitely be seen if you have an appreciation for a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history this is a must see
<START> okay <UNK> is a pretty relative term but <UNK> is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of james <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films i've ever seen without the nasty edge of the <UNK> other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged <UNK> but how about making a film in the <UNK> that is set in <UNK> all the extras are <UNK> in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol' victor <UNK> as the much <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oh yes we also have maria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like crazy as a rebel leader there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing <UNK> to the <UNK> of american <UNK>
<START> i have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the u s <UNK> <UNK> demand for <UNK> ever read a tax code it is quite a trial to follow it's multiple <UNK> that our <UNK> and <UNK> push in to help their financial <UNK> and various interest groups despite claims that it is fair the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential most of the various special <UNK> are meant for their use go through the average <UNK> or <UNK> form and look at the variety of different investment and business <UNK> all of which have a different set of rules most people will never have any use for these br br the story here is that a wealthy <UNK> philip <UNK> uses his influence to tip off the irs that his neighbors paul douglas and <UNK> <UNK> have not <UNK> <UNK> in 20 years the <UNK> office of the irs is under fred clarke and he is <UNK> to attention for <UNK> with his influence he sends tony randall to check out the situation br br randall finds that douglas <UNK> and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people who rarely have need for cash they get along on their farm produce and <UNK> with their neighbors but randall trained in the clear to the irs lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to <UNK> but gradually douglas notes that reynolds is fond of randall and he keeps <UNK> randall from his chore eventually getting him drunk he also makes it difficult for randall to leave by having the <UNK> of his car removed for <UNK> by his two sons br br the plot follows the growing attraction and <UNK> between urban vaguely ambitious randall and countryside life loving reynolds they make a cute couple actually eventually after <UNK> complains randall is sent back in disgrace and clarke a <UNK> cookie gets down to <UNK> <UNK> and comes up with a very large tax bill that will possibly ruin <UNK> family br br the film does not end there it does end happily but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the government does all too frequently go in for destruction a chance in a million <UNK> saves the family but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick more realistic is how <UNK> boss charles lane cuts to the essence regarding <UNK> help by suggesting that next year his <UNK> will be looked at more carefully after that <UNK> is rather green
<START> i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't this brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all cbc canadian movies were <UNK> lately <UNK> have been the exception but this confused <UNK> <UNK> of trendy <UNK> mind <UNK> flash backs and <UNK> dialogue makes up for lost time i've never found margaret <UNK> books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isn't easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the <UNK> <UNK> toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the <UNK> are a little less pretentious
<START> let me start by saying i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before however i am in the video <UNK> myself and coming from that <UNK> i can say without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short should be it has a very good story and another thing i love an even better twist ending opening was very well done i loved video chosen for it and how it was edited br br i am not a fan of b w but the way this film uses the effect it works and with any film that is all that matters the flow of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done from a technical side of things which is side i normally work on everything is also very well done there is no major tech stuff to point out only minor one i have is that the end credits are a little <UNK> this is probably due to a rendering issue let me also say that i would have prefer to seen more of the love scene but i am guy so you can <UNK> that up to a guy factor br br so overall i rate it a 9 10 it is worth the watch if you fan of <UNK> and or short films br br ps sorry for bad <UNK> or spelling
<START> one of the <UNK> gems of the 1980's scenes features razor sharp satire and outstanding performances from <UNK> walker how did she not get a ton of roles after this and wallace shawn it's a delicious send up of class <UNK> and the people in those classes the writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced and sorry but the asian gangs if you can call one japanese guy <UNK> one of the other characters a gang were not put in for <UNK> value as another review implies they should been the value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the <UNK> wicked way it does it i found it creative funny and <UNK>
<START> this movie was made in 1948 but it still rings true today very very funny it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing great cast cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40's clothing architecture and family life many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to today's costs are pretty amazing i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it a true classic
<START> show favorites green arrow introduced this season <UNK> introduced in season 5 <UNK> season 4 and cyborg season 5 all come together along with clark to stop one of <UNK> evil plans in this thrilling mid season episode br br through his sophisticated technology green arrow learns that lex luthor is <UNK> <UNK> across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance <UNK> and people with abilities to run <UNK> on green arrow over the past months has allied arthur <UNK> <UNK> bart allen <UNK> and victor stone cyborg to stop lex and destroy these <UNK> after <UNK> clark to help the team puts on quite a show in <UNK> and destroying a local laboratory br br this episode is incredible full of action humor and fabulous dialog it feels more like a movie it is full of entertainment and provides as a <UNK> for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season
<START> yes i sat through the whole thing god knows why br br it was a long afternoon i had nothing to do it was <UNK> cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones i have br br i gave the <UNK> 4 stars out of a possible 10 i have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad <UNK> poor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effects br br the storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family daddy <UNK> and little girl that i assume the viewer is supposed to be <UNK> with all three of them were tedious and annoying you just want the dark side to get every one of them br br daddy is a cook whose <UNK> is cars daddy meets a rich man named <UNK> who <UNK> cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious <UNK> <UNK> keeps it in a <UNK> and refers to it as the <UNK> br br during the course of the film the <UNK> is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the devil so take your pick of <UNK> one of those explanations suits your fancy because trust me it doesn't really matter br br the <UNK> main problem seems to be that it <UNK> having a companion it gets a human companion and then eventually is <UNK> with the human being this of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who <UNK> up with the <UNK> br br and for the rest of us it just leads to a very long tedious movie br br
