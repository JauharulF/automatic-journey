<START> basically this is a pale shadow of high <UNK> which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns watching the detectives has none of that br br the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very weak script and the <UNK> of the leads not to mention the lack of any real visual story telling style i mean this film is centered around movies yet is itself incredibly <UNK> that's a major failing right there br br but the main problem is we simply don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors murphy and liu fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem well not terribly interesting br br oh yeah another thing for a romantic comedy it's not funny and the romance isn't terribly romantic either br br so avoid it even at its 90 something minute running time it's just not worth sitting through
<START> of all the versions of the odyssey or of any greek <UNK> story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline with some minor <UNK> and <UNK> e g the absence of <UNK> <UNK> and the fact that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in disguise in his <UNK> realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable masterpiece not some <UNK> sword and <UNK> b flick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and <UNK> of what is going on and what the actors are saying provided you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
<START> i was interested in the topic and only fans of drew <UNK> dancing on david <UNK> desk will find anything remotely interesting in it ok she shows some breast or maybe a body double does the plot is <UNK> to bits and the acting is horrible neither lead has any material to work with as the direction of the film leads nowhere don't waste your time see <UNK> <UNK> instead if you want a creepy drew barrymore film and if you want to see another skip this and see <UNK> again br br the treatment of the <UNK> legend is absolutely criminal as well refer to charles <UNK> novel descent into hell for something worth considering instead this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at blockbuster br br what makes any of these people think the acting here was <UNK> give me a break
<START> there have been some low moments in my life when i have been <UNK> and depressed sitting through <UNK> <UNK> was one of these br br the warning signs were there no premiere even the stars didn't want to attend and no reviews in magazines the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep br br nothing in the film was explained the narration was idiotic i <UNK> at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot <UNK> my joy i sincerely hope all involved in the film are <UNK> for this atrocity br br there were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour for example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to <UNK> himself <UNK> in a toilet <UNK> while telling the person in the next <UNK> to put his fingers in his ears br br my words cannot explain the anger i feel so i shall conclude thus br br <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> only who want to torture themselves
<START> love the tv show was hooked first time i saw it wish i was there acting in with them it touches reality when you love someone and you are thinking that you want to spend the rest of your life with then at a turn of events that you meet someone else and that person is more of who you want to be with you are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other someone is going to get hurt there's no stopping that making the decision is hard but do you want to go on being unhappy when you could have been why go on and live a life that you thought that you wanted or thinking you are doing the right thing and you both be unhappy that other person isn't going to wait a life time waiting they have a life a well making the decision that you really want will be better in the end making the best of what you have is a good thing a well money cars houses etc don't make you happy having the one person that you really want to be with to share it with does
<START> i think that movie can t be a scott s film that is impossible do you remember blade runner and alien two <UNK> movies versus a one i hope <UNK> see ever it good bye
<START> otto preminger <UNK> a noir cycle at <UNK> century fox reunited his laura leads for this stark gritty detective drama dana andrews again portrays a cop but this time he's hardened cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior you don't hate <UNK> you liked to beat them up mark dixon andrews <UNK> criminals as his own father was a crook he doesn't want to be sandy <UNK> kid so he became a policeman but his methods are harsh and hated br br one night investigating a murder he <UNK> punches a suspect ken <UNK> craig stevens so hard that it kills him a <UNK> dixon does his best to cover it up <UNK> to frame a hated thug <UNK> gary <UNK> for the crime however the blame falls on <UNK> father in law <UNK> taylor tom <UNK> whose daughter department store model morgan taylor tierney is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes <UNK> had slapped his wife <UNK> her father who did show up at his son in <UNK> apartment but not until dixon had <UNK> with the body with no better suspects <UNK> is arrested and charged br br <UNK> with guilt mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney he decides to take on <UNK> anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death <UNK> everything in the end he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done and he <UNK> the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan despite all the tragic circumstances morgan <UNK> her love for mark and will wait for him br br it was great to find this film on dvd after so many years of <UNK> obscurity eddie <UNK> a film noir <UNK> provides the commentary and does a good job but i find his <UNK> that audiences wouldn't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads since laura had been made six years earlier in that respect he is mistaken because they had appeared in the iron curtain two years prior to <UNK> and the film was a box office success br br andrews and tierney were fabulous together and ruth <UNK> is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha fanning the flames between the detective and the dame br br the night <UNK> give the film an air of menace gary <UNK> is great as the low life <UNK> who had a criminal past with <UNK> dad your father liked me he <UNK> mark karl malden and a young <UNK> brand are terrific also and tom <UNK> is just touching and funny as <UNK> <UNK> accused pop br br a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast
<START> when i sat down to watch <UNK> <UNK> i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars when i stood up i've seen both of these and more br br karl <UNK> was finally not the antagonist in a movie to start with <UNK> scott thomas played her role well but the real two stars in my opinion were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both acting superbly in <UNK> <UNK> portrayed <UNK> well br br the mixed <UNK> brought a nice color to the movie but i understand why people would get bored with it br br the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning <UNK> <UNK> both amazed me and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when <UNK> entered the unbelievably beautiful island br br rolls <UNK> phantom <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> 7 if anyone loves expensive <UNK> type cars this is their movie it is also a movie for people who love action sequences good acting landscapes of <UNK> beauty and above all a fast paced well written action movie with dazzling combat and a thoroughly <UNK> inner drama br br my vote as it has <UNK> a gloomy day is 10 10
<START> i am curious yellow a film in near <UNK> rhyme is said right at the start to be available in two versions yellow and blue was one of those big art house hits that first was a major sensation in sweden then a big scandal cause <UNK> in the united states when the one print was held by customs and it went all the way to the supreme court what's potent in the picture today is not so much what might offend by way of what's revealed in the sex or nudity the director actor <UNK> <UNK> films the various scenes in such a way that there is an abundance of flesh and <UNK> and the occasional graphic bit but it's always more so an intellectual expression than very lust like but the daring of the attempt at a pure <UNK> while at the same time making a true statement on the state of affairs in sweden who knew such things in a generally peaceful country i e usually neutral in foreign affairs and wars could be so <UNK> up politically at least that's part of <UNK> aim here br br like a filmmaker such as <UNK> <UNK> with some of his works like w r if not as surreal and deranged or to a slightly lesser extent <UNK> <UNK> is out to mix politics and sex mostly politics and social <UNK> around in the midst of also making it a comment on <UNK> a character in a film the two characters lena and <UNK> have a hot cold relationship in the story of the film where lena is a curious <UNK> wannabe who demonstrates in the street for <UNK> and <UNK> sort of in a cabin in the woods to become a fully <UNK> one while at the same time maybe too curious about her car salesman boyfriend and as this is going on which is by itself enough for one movie <UNK> <UNK> himself and his crew from time to time as they are making this story on film there's even a great bit <UNK> through where as if at a rock concert title cards fill in during a break in shooting who the crew are <UNK> having to use end credits then with this there's a whole other dynamic as <UNK> gives an actual performance not just a hey i'm the director playing the director bit br br at first one might not get this structure and that i am curious yellow is just a film where lena is a documentary <UNK> asking subjects about their thoughts on class <UNK> spain and franco and once in a while we see <UNK> father or <UNK> but <UNK> does something interesting the structure is so <UNK> as the viewer one has to stay on <UNK> it's impressive that so many years on a picture can surprise with not being afraid to mix dramatic narrative documentary film within a film and even a serious interview with martin <UNK> king who also acts as a quasi guru for lena it might not always be completely coherent analysis politically but it doesn't feel cheating or even with much of a satirical agenda like in a godard picture the satire <UNK> is after is akin to a godard but on a whole other <UNK> his <UNK> is playful but not completely loaded with <UNK> or tricks that could put off the less <UNK> viewer br br if i am curious yellow stands up as an intellectual enterprise and a full blown trip into exploring sex in a manner that was and is captivating for how much is shown and how comfortable it all seems to be for the actors it isn't entirely successful i think as an emotional experience where bergman had it down to a t with making a purely emotional film with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is more apt at connecting with specific ideas while not actually directing always very well when it comes time to do big or subtle scenes with the actors occasionally it works if only for the actors lena <UNK> mostly spectacular here in a performance that asks of her to make an ambitious but confused kid into someone sympathetic and vulnerable even and <UNK> <UNK> a great realistic <UNK> to the <UNK> lena but some 40 years later its hard to completely connect with everything that happens in the inner film of lena and <UNK> since perhaps intentionally <UNK> fills it up with clichés <UNK> has a girlfriend and kid will he leave her how will lena <UNK> her father and a heavy handed narration from his <UNK> of sorts br br and yet for whatever faults <UNK> may have ironically considering he means it to be a comment on itself i am curious yellow holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the waters of what could be done in swedish cinema or testing what couldn't be and <UNK> it for provocative and comedic usage i'd even go as far as to say it's influential and has probably been copied or <UNK> in more ways than one due to it being such a cult phenomenon at its time a specific technique used with the film <UNK> towards the end is <UNK> in <UNK> usage in funny games and should be seen by anyone looking into getting into avant garde or <UNK> film making if it's not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as w r or last tango it's close behind
<START> <UNK> cassidy with a horse who is not white not named <UNK> go figure br br this travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes <UNK> cassidy the actor who plays him is young versus old blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands will the real <UNK> please stand up br br one of the worst movies ever made believe it or not by the person who brought us the grandfather saga
<START> <UNK> is one of the finest films that i have seen and in my opinion it <UNK> even full metal jacket a film of similar nature <UNK> is played exceptionally well by farrell and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends the ending is brilliantly cut by <UNK> with the <UNK> harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave what a film
<START> a vietnam vet decides to take over a <UNK> town run amok and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated including women released to theaters just prior to a star is born which turned his career around this action drama <UNK> starring kris kristofferson is wildly off <UNK> <UNK> and mean spirited filmed in <UNK> valley <UNK> the results are truly <UNK> with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director george <UNK> script <UNK> has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film including jan michael vincent victoria principal <UNK> peters and in a bit <UNK> anderson however the center of the whole thing is kristofferson who is gruff and rude throughout it deserves points i suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive in thriller but the bad <UNK> and the ridiculous climax coat the whole project like an ugly <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> first off i have to say that i loved the book animal farm i read it with my <UNK> grade class and it was great we also decided that watching the movie would be <UNK> the movie was so disappointing to me the movie cuts out some characters and misses a lot of the main points of the book it <UNK> around a lot and doesn't explain anything in detail if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused the most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending the ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together but instead the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs to sum up i don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that <UNK> portrayed in his book
<START> years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie <UNK> in between the actual features along with a <UNK> of current events plus cartoons especially on a saturday afternoon the parents loved it mostly the return of <UNK> was a 12 episode serial where <UNK> bela lugosi the mysterious mr wong <UNK> is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of <UNK> to rescue the kidnapped princess of egypt <UNK> maria alba dr <UNK> house of horrors <UNK> princess <UNK> is held captive by the black magic cult of <UNK> who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long dead <UNK> <UNK> these 12 episode serials take you way back in time and are very well produced considering we are talking about 1934
<START> i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles <UNK> a very enjoyable supporting actor was in this film so why didn't i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the <UNK> written and most clichéd a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slip <UNK> the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself <UNK> exactly what would happen next and i was always right and this isn't because i am some sort of movie <UNK> but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred <UNK> carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end <UNK> there is more suspense in a <UNK> film will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is <UNK> from break br br despite the very very tired and clichéd script there were a few <UNK> about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten <UNK> or slept in days also charles <UNK> <UNK> did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it's a shame it could have been so much better
<START> beast wars is a show that is over hyped <UNK> and overrated let's meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this br br <UNK> seriously they need to have <UNK> bars on this guy how come he <UNK> creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby <UNK> at least <UNK> from <UNK> 3 <UNK> havoc is voiced by slip slide action blast if you want a line of show that suck get <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a show that should go down in a toilet good job creators sarcasm show it self retarded boring at least the super mario games are better this show had a lot of followers <UNK> bring it back but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good
<START> i should have figured that any movie with the <UNK> lady in it isn't going to be good it actually starts out okay but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie inside of a movie there's people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie one girl in the audience is so annoying that i would have turned around and <UNK> her a bit strange but far from good
<START> i'm sure to people watching this move outside of <UNK> this film will be an entertaining watch but for someone from the uk it's painful in it's errors br br right at the start of the film <UNK> wood gets off a tube at bank station which has been <UNK> he says to his sister who he's meeting what happened here and she replies oh <UNK> were in town yesterday <UNK> are in town already they're part of the town they don't have to go there and if <UNK> fans wanted to fight other fans the last place on earth they'd do it is bank station where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world br br there are several other similar errors but the biggest failing for me is the actor who plays the lead <UNK> he clearly decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with an east end accent and instead <UNK> for a dick van dyke style mock <UNK> which made my ears bleed it was <UNK> by the fact the rest of his gang all spoke in the way you'd expect west ham fans to speak this error made him unbelievable in the role and really <UNK> the film
<START> i don't like this film but then i didn't think much of the book either which although <UNK> by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more <UNK> than <UNK> dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until <UNK> became <UNK> in the mid 80s br br i was intrigued to see what sort of soup <UNK> would make with such <UNK> ingredients he has worked hard script wise to <UNK> the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn't rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film <UNK> <UNK> br br in a word forgettable
<START> the premise of the film is that thomas <UNK> son was murdered and his wife was <UNK> and he is given a chance at revenge when after post traumatic stress disorder therapy he is put in a room with a man <UNK> to a chair and told this was the <UNK> he is given a large table of <UNK> with which to offer <UNK> <UNK> bats nails <UNK> <UNK> whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being br br we go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime the two then create an uncomfortable alliance who put them in this situation and why br br well when all is said and done we don't really care
<START> yes a tap dancing horror thriller with shelley and debbie <UNK> <UNK> this is demented and campy fun and part of the <UNK> cycle of the 60s that <UNK> into the 70s released as a double feature with the burt reynolds comedy <UNK> this mad scare is so <UNK> as to be <UNK> entertaining like a mix of day of the <UNK> the other and baby jane i suggest any <UNK> viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be <UNK> <UNK> and sit with someone with whom you can <UNK> and <UNK> all through it actually get drunk whilst you watch it on cheap <UNK> again with many 30s film ideas they are also about <UNK> the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder but this one is just plain crazy it also reminds me a lot of bloody mama the de niro winters <UNK> fest that makes this film look positively glorious
<START> a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this film br br in fact what is the point of it br br the scenes <UNK> through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline br br the performances of the cast are questionable if not believable br br did i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel br br
<START> i've tried to like this film really in watching it all i can think is this guy gives me the creeps i would have gotten a <UNK> order it also calls out <UNK> in capital letters was this really the conversation before making the movie let's make a film that puts two <UNK> depressed socially inept people into a relationship which <UNK> their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are from what i've seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self pity br br the mood of the movie is distinctly 80 ish brooding and slow don't get me wrong the film has its moments just very few of them
<START> br br dull <UNK> going thru the motions <UNK> <UNK> ominous <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> michael <UNK> trying to be dynamic which ain't his <UNK> br br to quote buffy <UNK> if the apocalypse comes <UNK> me br br going back to sleep now
<START> this is a must see for anybody who loves <UNK> specially political thriller one scene that stands out is <UNK> experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented br br the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is <UNK> to investigate the assassination however one of the member does not agree with the final <UNK> of the <UNK> as per the terms set that member would <UNK> a one man investigation into the assassination this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled
<START> a comedy of <UNK> funny proportions from the guys that brought you south park and most of the guys from <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> movie has utterly disgusting <UNK> and satirical content it portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals i love it this is some funny stuff really funny two loser friends create a game in <UNK> <UNK> which explodes into a national sensation corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour and its up <UNK> coop <UNK> fix it and along the way you will laugh alot that's all there is enjoy
<START> i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award but after watching it it's easy to see why it didn't despite the beautiful photography the film is incredibly slow moving despite having hardly any plot br br the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident the film is never clear on this and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot but they're very short and don't really seem to have any point br br the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life but the boy <UNK> by <UNK> the flower first to make sure it is not <UNK> which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend the grandfather then <UNK> that the moral is that the boy was too <UNK> but that doesn't make any sense because it was <UNK> and <UNK> which resulted in his failure perfect metaphor for this film really br br the photography of <UNK> is beautiful though but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in <UNK> and beautifully photographed and it's infinitely better than this one
<START> brilliant my wife and i joined the <UNK> line to see holly at the <UNK> film festival after seeing the film i can understand why there was such a long line holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people she is a young girl he is a worn out <UNK> the film <UNK> every bone in our body there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch its the <UNK> of <UNK> that really kicks you in the gut the film is beautifully shot among others we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cant believe this is her first acting job and ron <UNK> performance stayed with me for a couple of days highly recommended
<START> this movie is really <UNK> there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood <UNK> in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a 2 out 10
<START> a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten br br 1 2 a classic in time simply a must see br br a solid worth while very entertaining piece br br 1 2 a good movie but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws br br may still be considered good in areas but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed <UNK> e g genre br br 1 2 mostly a heap of nothing <UNK> by mildly worthwhile moments br br bomb not of a <UNK> quality br br kalifornia br br <UNK> for strong violent material considerable sexuality and language br br i rented this film expecting an in your face summer blockbuster quality celebration of brad <UNK> face but was happily surprised and disappointed this really is more of a drama and very grim at that i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice overs br br pitt plays out his possibly un <UNK> film ever with startling talent who started out as a hopeless yet harmless white trash husband became realized as a violent disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind during some of the latter stages in the film i found it hard to keep watching him he was unpredictable and scary this proves very good writing and acting br br the whole movie is filled with bizarre sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once and i don't mean action scenes i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually <UNK> and <UNK> at what i was seeing it was like watching a <UNK> and a lion put in a cage and watching as they <UNK> each other to death again i am very impressed with the screenwriter s whoever they are did the impossible mixed oil and water br br i also very much enjoyed juliette <UNK> performance it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy some of her moments in this film brought me to tears i mean that the emotions this girl can <UNK> in your head are incredible and i clearly remember getting <UNK> eyed on a few occasions br br i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality <UNK> the film makers have displayed by only giving kalifornia a rating but the dark feelings that it <UNK> are too potent and depressing to raise it i do believe that everyone should see this movie though i truly do
<START> higher and higher was one of <UNK> <UNK> lesser broadway musicals it only had a run of <UNK> performances on broadway in 1940 yet it <UNK> one of their bigger hits it never entered my mind br br nevertheless except for one minor song so <UNK> rich the entire broadway score was <UNK> when rko bought the film rights instead a whole new score by jimmy <UNK> and harold <UNK> was written mostly to <UNK> one francis albert sinatra who was making his feature film debut br br sinatra who had done some vocal cameos in previous films takes a <UNK> from the page of his singing rival bing crosby when bing did his feature film debut in the big broadcast he played bing crosby frank sinatra took on the role of frank sinatra and i can't think of anyone who could have done a better job br br the <UNK> of the board is billed third here behind stars jack <UNK> and <UNK> morgan he's the butler and she's the <UNK> maid to leon errol in fact errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months mainly because he's about to go belly up into chapter 11 or so he informs the staff br br <UNK> a delightful old soul to work for and none of the staff want to lose a good thing they pool their resources and get <UNK> morgan to <UNK> <UNK> daughter who's over in switzerland with her mother the idea being to <UNK> a rich <UNK> in the hopes <UNK> the family fortune only <UNK> starts looking at another br br it's a slight plot and certainly no worse than a whole lot of musicals but rko invested this film with a good cast of players barbara hale and elizabeth <UNK> play another <UNK> and her mother who suspect <UNK> not right victor <UNK> is a fortune seeking no account <UNK> wilson paul <UNK> grace <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mel <UNK> and mary <UNK> play others of the errol household staff not a bad bunch at all br br sinatra sang three good <UNK> all of them had some kind of commercial success the music stopped a lovely way to spend an evening and i couldn't sleep a <UNK> last night the last one was nominated for an oscar for best song but lost to alice <UNK> you'll never know br br 1943 was the year of the <UNK> union strike against the recording industry to get their material out frank sinatra recorded the songs from higher and higher with an <UNK> chorus for columbia bing crosby recorded songs from his film <UNK> in the same manner for <UNK> both of them were <UNK> by the president of the union james c <UNK> as <UNK> and both did not cross the <UNK> line again the strike wasn't settle completely until 1944 although <UNK> broke ranks earlier from the other record companies and settled earlier than columbia <UNK> victor and the others br br the strike provided some anxious moments for sinatra he had just left the tommy <UNK> orchestra when the strike was called it closed off a needed <UNK> for his artistry when he wasn't sure whether leaving <UNK> would prove to be a right career move br br fortunately higher and higher was received well a legend was launched
<START> i disagree with previous comment about this movie i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter you don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool you can be smart and pretty and classy all at once br br i think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience all in all my wife daughter 10 and i each thought it was a good movie i certainly recommend it it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys br br it was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away i can't think of a better outcome for that movie than <UNK> interest in that classic series
<START> reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette <UNK> success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart fog over <UNK> and on human bondage characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different <UNK> in the former is a beautiful glamorous and <UNK> <UNK> and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a pale <UNK> and <UNK> cockney waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as <UNK> career destroying role was the one she fought for <UNK> for months and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing br br the film which tells about a medical student phillip carey leslie howard which falls <UNK> in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere <UNK> minutes for example it is quite unclear why <UNK> student found any interest in an <UNK> waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved nevertheless the integrity of the story is <UNK> by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic <UNK> music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters' faces in fact the film is <UNK> by <UNK> walking sequences showing him from the back <UNK> with <UNK> two tone <UNK> every detail is well thought max <UNK> wrote a beautiful <UNK> for each women in <UNK> life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see <UNK> face in front of <UNK> is one of the <UNK> scenes i've ever seen exactly due to francis <UNK> breathtaking beauty ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as <UNK> captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing br br but my strongest <UNK> is that events are presented too two <UNK> which <UNK> viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets phillip know that she <UNK> him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is phillips <UNK> nature connected to his club foot and <UNK> experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is <UNK> to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and <UNK> mildred after discovering <UNK> <UNK> bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she <UNK> after realizing that the bondage has <UNK> it is less than clear why would she burn <UNK> money <UNK> intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk <UNK> of <UNK> br br for modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark

<START> piece is cake is <UNK> <UNK> history of the worst kind whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the admittedly fictional pilots it portrays it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth br br in the march 1989 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wrote a <UNK> <UNK> of the way that <UNK> fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini series a few of his comments are worth repeating br br there was no sense of <UNK> at any time in any of the <UNK> that i saw in action and a total absence of the <UNK> portrayed in <UNK> of <UNK> it would not have been <UNK> for a moment the <UNK> atmosphere was more akin to that in a good <UNK> club though with more discipline nor was there any sense of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> training had insisted that we were there to defend this country and now we were required to do it no more and no less br br there was no discussion of <UNK> or <UNK> people either had guts or they did not but mostly they did but we knew fear <UNK> it in ourselves and in each other did our <UNK> to control it and then got on with the job br br i could feel no <UNK> but there was a sense of greatness and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to <UNK> of <UNK> br br <UNK> was in his own words a fighter pilot who unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series was there at the time br br <UNK> served with <UNK> <UNK> both in france and the bob before going on to become one of the <UNK> <UNK> of both the <UNK> and <UNK> and a post war test pilot br br piece of cake is an absolute total <UNK> of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace
<START> somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed zombie like killers the guinea pigs for the experiment are scantily clad <UNK> young women in desperate need of acting lessons this movie is awful atrocious and amazingly bad it has little to no logic in the script you really will have trouble following what is going on it has no special effects the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific <UNK> looks nothing more than an old <UNK> screen and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with <UNK> of felt hair looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it named george that is like a personal servant <UNK> to jessica the leading actress throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic <UNK> <UNK> of this puppet but wait you also get loads of <UNK> <UNK> barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place none of the actors are good there are just varying degrees of bad the gore and horror aspects are especially <UNK> filmed the film really looks like an adolescent put it together no coincidence henry <UNK> the director by name but not by trade has not made another film i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid silly dreck and how bout the ending what happened if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore
<START> dolph lundgren <UNK> and <UNK> his way through this incoherent mystery thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe he is actually quite good here but the story is a mess of b movie cliches detectives revenge <UNK> <UNK> s m that looks like it was made up as they went along the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick rent red <UNK> instead
<START> let us begin by saying that this film's english title the power of <UNK> <UNK> is an absolute <UNK> it is because in hong sang <UNK> film there are no actual shots of wars troubles and conflicts so the idea of establishing power of a <UNK> is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film if we were to judge this film by its korean language title <UNK> do <UNK> him is going to appear as a <UNK> statement about emotional <UNK> of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest hong sang <UNK> has also directed a highly prolific visual document about <UNK> choices made by people in their lives the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> if making a film out of <UNK> can be claimed as a film <UNK> <UNK> virtue then hong sang <UNK> has to be <UNK> as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about <UNK> <UNK> of human relationships sentiments and lives whether one likes it or not this is the only fair conclusion that be <UNK> from this particular film
<START> i sat through both parts of che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and i can't recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly i'd had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because i have a real <UNK> about directors producers and <UNK> who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and i feel that on the whole 2 to 2 5 hours is about right for a movie so 4 hours seemed to be <UNK> the limits of my tolerance and i was very dubious about the whole enterprise but i will say <UNK> that this is a beautifully  i might say lovingly  made movie and i'm really glad i saw it director steven soderbergh is to be <UNK> on the clarity of his vision the battle scenes <UNK> as if you were <UNK> the bullets yourself br br if there is a person on the planet who doesn't know <UNK> <UNK> guevara was the <UNK> doctor who helped <UNK> castro <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> via the 1959 cuban revolution when i was a kid in the 1960s che's image was everywhere on bedroom wall posters on t shirts on magazine covers che's image has to be one of the most over exploited ever if the famous images are to be relied on then che was a very good looking guy the epitome of revolutionary <UNK> had he been butt ugly i have to wonder if he would have ever been quite so popular in the public imagination of course dying young helps br br movies have been made about che before notably the excellent motorcycle <UNK> of 2004 which starred the <UNK> cute <UNK> garcia <UNK> as young che <UNK> south america and seeing the <UNK> poverty which formed his <UNK> politics but i don't think anyone has ever <UNK> the entire story from beginning to end and this two <UNK> is an ambitious project i hope it pays off for soderbergh but i can only imagine that instant commercial success may not have been <UNK> in his mind br br the first movie the <UNK> shows che meeting castro in mexico and follows their journey to cuba to start the revolution and then the journey to new york in 1964 to address the un cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary film but aren't the second film <UNK> picks up again in 1966 when che arrives in bolivia to start a new revolutionary movement the second movie takes place almost entirely in the forest as far as i can see it was shot mostly in spain but i can still believe it must have been quite <UNK> to film <UNK> del toro is excellent as che a part he seems born to play br br personally i felt that the <UNK> ie part one was much easier to watch and more <UNK> in the strictly movie sense because it is upbeat they are winning the revolution will succeed che is in his element leading a <UNK> band of <UNK> workers and <UNK> in the revolutionary cause the second part is much harder to watch because of the <UNK> of his defeat in much the same way that the recent <UNK> while being a good movie was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure so i felt the same about part two of che <UNK> we know at the outset that he dies we know he fails it is frustrating because the way the story is told it is obvious fairly early on that the <UNK> of revolution in bolivia is doomed che is regarded as a foreign intruder and fails to connect with the <UNK> peoples in the way that he did with the <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> which is frustrating to watch because i felt that he should have known when to give up and move on to other perhaps more successful <UNK> the movie does not <UNK> him too much he kills people he <UNK> he struggles with his <UNK> and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up and moved on he leaves a wife alone to bring up five <UNK> children br br but overall an excellent exercise in classic movie making one note as i watched the us trained <UNK> soldiers move in en <UNK> to pick off che and his small band of warriors one by one it reminded me of the finale to butch cassidy i almost turned to my husband and said so but <UNK> thinking he would find such thoughts trite and out of place as we left the theatre he turned to me and said didn't you think the end was like butch <UNK>
<START> <UNK> samurai sees sonny chiba and some other guys get transported back to civil war stricken <UNK> japan for no particular reason and much carnage ensues it's a rather over the top <UNK> of sword vs machine gun that ultimately <UNK> some interesting results br br the plot essentially runs along the <UNK> that you might expect from the title initial fish out the water antics what is this flying metal box etc etc aren't we better off here discussions and ultimately a huge battle the latter is proof that the film doesn't take itself seriously at all the carnage taking up most of the second half as samurai army battles <UNK> platoon a face off one would fully expect from the title but it still manages to <UNK> with its <UNK> and <UNK> it's certainly one of the most unique battle sequences of its time and doesn't drag despite its extended length br br chiba gives a gruff performance as <UNK> initially a good leader but someone who finally finds himself questioning his own morals as the situation slowly has an effect on him this is certainly one of his better vehicles from his terrific <UNK> by the final act the two worlds have had such an effect on each other you have to wonder if it was a bit of <UNK> on the part of the writers as they seem to be asking weren't we better off back then ' but this is maybe reading a bit much into was can generally be described as a hugely entertaining two hours of almost non stop action
<START> after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project it would be great to see a contemporary <UNK> ken burns take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone with modern technology to improve old <UNK> footage and lots of information that has been <UNK> since 1974 when the world at war was produced an updated version of this series would be welcome the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an <UNK> series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original if you are interested in this era don't miss this series it is required viewing
<START> i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf and before i got my first vcr i figured i'd <UNK> it with this little gem and it's bad film making at it's finest br br the dialog is inadvertently hilarious and it contains a cameo with donald <UNK> anthony quinn is in it inexplicably and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years this movie is mr <UNK> country bears br br it features lines like shut up and let me fight br br and you're saying a lot of sh it br br and the priceless comeback unfortunately it is sh it tough angry sh it br br you'll be <UNK> by a fight scene as bo does a <UNK> across a <UNK> table and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll chop <UNK> action and t and a thrills br br what schlock movie fan could ask for more oh and when mr <UNK> character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his <UNK> illness he says real men don't eat <UNK> br br uh <UNK> yeah if bo was a smart cookie she <UNK> called for an exorcist right then and there
<START> i saw this movie on t v this afternoon and i can't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash it's not funny at all and it takes your i q down a few <UNK> i know this movie is for kids but that doesn't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a the word <UNK> equals big laugh b a four foot tall kid can <UNK> on a ten foot tall basketball net c kids should always fight <UNK> armed with guns because the <UNK> will fall for anything and d 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so called ninjas with swords one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldn't scare anybody maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh don't bother with this lame ass excuse for a movie
<START> excellent story about teenagers leaders high school football stars how far will you go to protect your friends lie kill how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl can love beat the odds can you defeat narrow minded small town people when your friend scores and you lose will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it or will you be a man about it and respect her right to chose will you rape her and show it as your victory over a problem girl can you stand by the one who's only sin is to have an opinion of her own to be able to make her own decisions to chose for herself it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong but one is for sure very disturbing movie and theme in general thumb up
<START> a <UNK> in eastern european film making and an outstanding example of serbian mentality a group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes two <UNK> movies everyone here knows word by word
<START> oh my this was the worst reunion movie i have ever seen that is saying a lot i am ashamed of watching br br what happened in the script <UNK> <UNK> i know let's have two stud <UNK> fall <UNK> in love with the most annoying character since cousin oliver yeah that'll be cool br br even for sitcoms this was the most implausible plot since ron <UNK> starting <UNK> painting bald men
<START> i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the <UNK> reason that it has nothing to comment upon it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world <UNK> for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a <UNK> <UNK> br br filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by <UNK> <UNK> who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days br br under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial <UNK> quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well <UNK> imdb members a favor don't write an online review for it will <UNK> <UNK> and in the end waste their time br br on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie
<START> this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast i mean best the story co written by <UNK> peterson <UNK> alter ego is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by <UNK> wit and charm the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of <UNK> <UNK> where she has <UNK> from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt <UNK> will and at the same time tries to help the long suffering teenagers who have been <UNK> of fun by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the town <UNK> she also has to deal with her attraction to bob <UNK> the owner of the local cinema and another woman patty who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira and later in the movie she also faces the complications of being <UNK> from <UNK> major <UNK> <UNK> and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable <UNK> and naive in this film while cracking <UNK> jokes and delivering off beat lines with double meanings br br this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams in the end <UNK> dreams finally come true which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman br br i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie a review will not do justice to the actual movie so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made meanwhile i wish you <UNK> dreams <UNK>
<START> so this movie has been <UNK> <UNK> and carried to incredible heights but in the end what is it really many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work the fairly academic camera work keeps the <UNK> <UNK> and scenes that are in <UNK> are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively <UNK> the voice interpretation of <UNK> dialogue under the excuse that <UNK> character likes the sound of his voice turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on <UNK> does shine in the few scenes where her <UNK> is not partially hidden from view but nonetheless most of the movie when this is a love story is only showed from a single point of view that of the man as ebert said if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate it's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them br br the idea that an <UNK> teacher who uses methods that have been <UNK> in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself his character becomes <UNK> as a credible teacher as the movie goes on drawing comedy from a deaf accent is quite honestly rather low and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty <UNK> of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few <UNK> meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated in a way that's fairly inconsistent with his <UNK> i have seen <UNK> <UNK> switch to <UNK> between each other even when they weren't aware of a deaf person being in the area and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to as a lover he seems like a typical <UNK> nice guy including his tendency to act <UNK> afterwards and yet the movie is indeed only really seen through him as everything his lover says is <UNK> through his voice br br the scenes involving the other deaf kids are in general <UNK> the broken symbolism fails the dance scene the pool scene even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken <UNK> at best many hearing people i know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel instead of <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of <UNK> no seriously when i go swim i go swim br br it also fails at carrying the end of the play instead making it a story of a deaf woman who <UNK> to a strong man even though the original play ended with a more equal ground where both have to accept each other as they are and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands not the <UNK> in her throat br br and for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be <UNK> <UNK> remains hollywood's token deaf woman to this day
<START> this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10 10 for all you people out there who are rating this film low <UNK> because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but <UNK> action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even <UNK> scenes from this movie if you want a true man a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's hes pure in <UNK> he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park and even in todays movies american movies rely so much on special effects and safety <UNK> and stunt <UNK> and so much more police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do a masterpiece
<START> boring children's fantasy that gives joan <UNK> star billing but little to do sappy kids pursue their dreams frankie wants to be a <UNK> and a baseball player <UNK> while best friend <UNK> runs for mayor she's 13 totally pedestrian in every way plus the added <UNK> of <UNK> performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys certainly a lesser effort for showtime no limits
<START> as far as i can recall <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> score are as follows br br 1 the final section of the <UNK> a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over br br 2 a <UNK> solo written for but eliminated from <UNK> score for the sleeping beauty is <UNK> between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene <UNK> chose this music because of its <UNK> relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter br br 3 the solo for the sugar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is eliminated br br it seems to me the <UNK> that <UNK> has somehow <UNK> <UNK> great score is misplaced
<START> holes is a wonderful film to see it has good messages in in such as be a good friend never give up etc i highly recommend it to anyone i still say the book is better than the movie but the movie gives the book a run for its money also <UNK> thomas plays zero that really adds to it lol
<START> when i saw the <UNK> of year 3000 at first time i had no expectations for that movie although it wasn't so bad as i was thought it's kind of italian version of <UNK> with cast that is almost famous in italy including <UNK> <UNK> behind the story is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh <UNK> you can also see other <UNK> to italian horror movies <UNK> <UNK> plays the role of tommy and you can see that kid in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> city of the living dead aka gates of hell as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of <UNK> brother quite entertaining movie with some dull parts
<START> this is the most <UNK> romance i ever sat through the perfect film for an <UNK> housewife in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> to watch in the afternoon lying on the couch eating <UNK> in fact <UNK> play a prominent role in the movie br br the only reason i was able to watch to the end is that i finally was able to <UNK> at keanu <UNK> dreamy face in almost every scene in most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look the only rapid action in this show is <UNK> <UNK> waving his hands with latin <UNK> more italian than mexican really br br the dialog is as stiff as wood unfortunately no <UNK> are ripped the hero is <UNK> perfect mannered and mild the <UNK> warm blooded old world family cliche is as old as the hills what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican this is a fairy story br br i knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie i hoped for the glowing <UNK> looked like the <UNK> of all food ads in women's day magazine i didn't see his name listed but the art director surely was thomas <UNK> who paints the million dollar <UNK> of irish <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> this film was literally seen through rose colored glasses if you like dreamy pink and blue sky this film is for you the <UNK> looked really good too
<START> the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine this movie is no <UNK> and certainly no casablanca i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate <UNK> that now <UNK> us <UNK> in sit <UNK> and the dialogue is stilted and preachy but let's look at the <UNK> theme of the movie br br with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom since watch on the <UNK> author <UNK> <UNK> has been exposed as a <UNK> <UNK> with her so called real life story julia from her book <UNK> as one of the most <UNK> of a <UNK> of western based <UNK> <UNK> it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator <UNK> and international communism from the <UNK> who had just proved their military <UNK> in spain br br as one reviewer correctly noted this is not a pro american play and movie as <UNK> went to her grave an american loathing communist this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual <UNK> that made up the american left then just as now the full <UNK> left of the daily <UNK> and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america
<START> i've just had the evidence that confirmed my <UNK> a bunch of kids 14 to 22 put on the dvd of titanic on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal only two of them had actually seen it before but they all had seen the moment of kate leo and celine <UNK> so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie shortly after the epic started they started to get restless some of them left asking the others call us when the iceberg appears over an hour and a half into the movie only the two girls who had seen the movie before were still there they started shouting iceberg iceberg a <UNK> followed they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic they sat open mouthed <UNK> <UNK> and far outs so just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene what is this one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it dr <UNK> for instance had a similar running time but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time in titanic leo teaches kate how to spit look at the faces and hands of the supposedly <UNK> de la <UNK> in the first class <UNK> room of the ship look at the historical details if you can find them the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink the real sinking here is of film standards all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends the film went on to become the highest <UNK> movie of all time so what do i know
<START> i loved this movie first because it is a family movie second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family with far less <UNK> than what i have normally seen in the movies the brothers are very close yet are not <UNK> their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end i understand that <UNK> choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but i believed it was the right choice for him i can't believe that this was a french television programme it had great production values i gave this movie a ten and i think you will too once you have seen it
<START> this only gets <UNK> because it stars david <UNK> well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn't too bad it has the beautiful leslie <UNK> she is super hot but can't talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is <UNK> raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as <UNK> 3 10
<START> i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all the play of the actors weren't any better br br of course <UNK> khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie credible and interesting br br i've read that this movie was based on the novel of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yet for me i didn't see it matching with the indian mentality br br in general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just can't understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of 6 8 10 br br so it's the kind of movie you should run away ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story
<START> i'm a fan of c c going back to their records and liked this movie but at one point in the mid 1980's on cable television in san jose california it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie all references to marijuana were replaced with <UNK> the bag that red drops to chong has <UNK> in it instead of marijuana but the conversation still remains the same it's worth 3000 <UNK> there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added <UNK> c c and talking to each other about getting the <UNK> at the end instead of space coke it's something else i'm not sure who created this version but it was horrible and obvious that they were attempting to make it family child friendly it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all
<START> director <UNK> <UNK> stays true to his own <UNK> play it straight and they will laugh and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the 1 cult film of all time mystery men ' when an evil villain <UNK> frankenstein geoffrey rush is released from a mental institution captures the local superhero captain amazing greg kinnear and threatens to take over champion city three wanna be <UNK> mr furious ben stiller the <UNK> william h macy and the blue <UNK> hank <UNK> come to the rescue frankenstein has been joined by a <UNK> assortment of underworld <UNK> however and has become a <UNK> <UNK> the trio realize that help is needed and decide to <UNK> what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of <UNK> ever assembled in the history of the cinema mr furious has his rage the <UNK> his <UNK> the blue <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mainly <UNK> and the occasional <UNK> but never a knife the invisible boy <UNK> mitchell can turn invisible as long as no one is watching the <UNK> wes <UNK> a heavy <UNK> from down south is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind maybe the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> a ball with deadly accuracy and the <UNK> paul <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that can <UNK> an entire room this is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or <UNK> the audience while playing it straight at all times the dialogue is witty and the performances given by stiller macy <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> there is a number of memorable hilarious scenes especially the one in which they throw a pool party and <UNK> to <UNK> and conduct interviews with a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and another in a bar when the <UNK> has a conversation with her long dead father whose skull has been <UNK> in her <UNK> ball the funniest of all however has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue captain amazing but these are only examples for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time the real secret of it's success though is that <UNK> keeps it all real the relationships between the characters are true and the whole concept of being a <UNK> is played as being entirely reasonable which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings in this world the aspirations of mr furious and the rest are <UNK> and <UNK> keeps the laughs coming without ever <UNK> to slapstick or mere sight gags the solid supporting cast includes lena <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> eddie izzard tony p tom waits doc <UNK> claire <UNK> monica louise <UNK> the blue <UNK> mother <UNK> lewis lucille and <UNK> tony c mystery <UNK> is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing guaranteed in the immortal words of the <UNK> we are number one all others are number two or lower ' is it an oscar worthy movie hardly but for a good time and a lot of laughs treat yourself to this <UNK> of comedy it's the real deal and you won't regret it i rate this one 10 10
<START> this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival but unlike yes by sally potter which i had seen some days before where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive this time quite the opposite thing happened there was something that dragged me down and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe it was as if all of a sudden there was nothing left all hope all future had been taken away to a dead place br br <UNK> life seemed to be dismal and locked but then one lovely day there appears that kind of <UNK> that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the <UNK> of her dreams there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion just out of nothing someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life that person was toni a <UNK> girl who does not seem to have any roots just like herself br br but the film's title is ghosts and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish there is no way to retain <UNK> ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people strange ideas that <UNK> your mind and are only perceived by yourself hiding away from all other people <UNK> a french woman is a victim of such ghosts she once lost her child daughter in berlin who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket in just one moment of <UNK> now time has passed and <UNK> is back in berlin still looking for the missing child br br nina could be that child after all she has got that same <UNK> at her <UNK> and the heart shaped <UNK> between her shoulder <UNK> which seems to prove her true identity br br and nina <UNK> that idea after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion she also <UNK> for a mother but in the end she is empty handed toni has disappeared with a man and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman marie is dead concludes <UNK> husband and the statement could not be more <UNK> nina is just a <UNK> a girl without name there is no hope for any divine <UNK> there is no marie in this world to <UNK> our lonely lives therefore in the end we see nina all alone about to walk along the road that has opened up before her into a future that seems <UNK> and uncertain
<START> this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life i'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 how can the story script is so weak she was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible br br the words i love you it doesn't meant anything in this film
<START> well now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of 1 000 corpses <UNK> i can now rest in peace nothing about the <UNK> performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a <UNK> <UNK> comes up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former <UNK> in hell house sorry i don't remember the actual name of the <UNK> a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago some like <UNK> <UNK> stand in john carradine whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments <UNK> it to the supernatural <UNK> film director john ireland <UNK> it as <UNK> <UNK> the result comes across like <UNK> school for girls catchy title made for tv production values intriguing plot crossed with children shouldn't play with dead things low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead trouble is it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its <UNK> minutes going through <UNK> <UNK> dragging us along for every <UNK> second
<START> i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts br br it doesn't hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much better br br i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes br br don't waste your money unless you are a <UNK> and just want to see all of mr <UNK> and ms <UNK> films br br it was a poor way to spend an evening
<START> house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes stiff acting final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so <UNK> <UNK> with your head house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do of course this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they <UNK> so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on even though we think that we do but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game a film for which repeated viewings are <UNK> instead if <UNK> br br it has a definite hitchcock <UNK> to it the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort <UNK> considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the <UNK> more thought provoking works one could easily consider the idea of lindsay <UNK> character being the same as <UNK> <UNK> ten year later perhaps both are strong <UNK> <UNK> both with <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> them to walk too close to the shark pool as <UNK> repressed up tight character says what's life without adventure put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks
<START> i was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of <UNK> it's an indie low budget no big name actors <UNK> director i had heard it was good but not this good br br placed in a contemporary ethnic working class brooklyn <UNK> <UNK> has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day do day struggles of urban <UNK> diana the protagonist is <UNK> with anger and <UNK> out at her high school peers getting in trouble with the school and her friends she is being raised by her single father who appears to love her and her brother but applies a strict sex based double standard on his children the father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that tiny the brother is taking boxing lessons at the local gym but diana is denied similar <UNK> on an <UNK> to the gym to meet tiny diana is captivated by boxing tiny doesn't like boxing so he and diana trade places he gets the money from dad then gives it to diana to take the lessons in his place br br this is actually a feel good movie as diana grows and learns about herself through boxing meets a guy and <UNK> some very serious issues head on there's no <UNK> <UNK> that can go right does go <UNK> resolution a la bend it like beckham the reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat <UNK> but in my opinion <UNK> is a better and more satisfying film for it
<START> true fans of film will love this authentic movie br br i disagree with the <UNK> who are rating this movie a one star and calling it unrealistic while i don't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists i've spent many years working in lower <UNK> and working class <UNK> and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave i don't know what the basis is for <UNK> comments that the film is unrealistic the dialog is great br br the low budget production value didn't bother me a bit i felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film the focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not <UNK> hollywood <UNK> or melodrama br br i completely bought into the character's motivations and reactions the acting was believable and impressive for new and non actors br br if your idea of good film is transformers or fast furious then skip it if you enjoy good character driven dramas then see it br br regarding the negative <UNK> being <UNK> click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews
<START> i admit it's very silly but i've practically <UNK> the damn thing it holds a lot of good childhood memories for me my brother and i saw it opening day and i have respect for any movie with <UNK> on the soundtrack
<START> it's very very funny you know just like a comedy is supposed to be it also looks very very good like a hollywood spectacular should so what more do you want <UNK> about a very very good sally fields she is so much better here than in anything else i've ever seen her in and she looks so damn good this movie is all you need to understand why she's a star those eyes like a silent movie star but better in fact everyone's eyes are so good i used to pretend to be a bad tv soap actor with my girlfriend we'd do that thing where you look real fast from one eye to the other of your partner they don't do that at all in soap dish great the eyes have it sorry br br there's so many terrific performances its fun just waiting for each of them to <UNK> there's a whole <UNK> going on with kevin kline on how to <UNK> very very subtly got that yeah he's damn good so is robert downey jr who has since made <UNK> of a career of playing the slick slimy executive cathy <UNK> while not the most gifted actress is so charismatic and riveting especially when she's angry and even whoopi goldberg is decent her natural timing giving here somewhat flat delivery a little <UNK> ok no whoopi bashing i hear ya br br and then there's the hair soap dish was made at the end of the big hair eighties so the ridiculous <UNK> are like a great character in themselves they get bigger and <UNK> just like <UNK> did yeah we got pictures br br soap dish is better than i thought it'd be better that i wanted it to be i'm sick of movies that tell me i'm supposed to care about shallow self centered semi talented <UNK> ie tv soap actors soap dish seems happy just to have me laugh at 'em thank you
<START> it is not obvious from viewing this film so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of islam and its <UNK> of violence and <UNK> against all non muslims is lacking <UNK> and also completely fails to factor in the human condition it is one thing to document that the <UNK> says many things about how a <UNK> muslim is required to interact with non muslims but any <UNK> is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a <UNK> of islam will agree with and <UNK> with all <UNK> of that faith and system there is reason to call much about the <UNK> into question such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy <UNK> don't swallow it all hook line and <UNK> without some thinking of your own br br one specific for instance is <UNK> the person <UNK> <UNK> who claims to be a former muslim who <UNK> an act of terrorism in <UNK> there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these <UNK> i am not nor have i ever been a muslim i have never read the <UNK> i am not a christian nor a member of any faith but i am an intelligent and <UNK> human while the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how some muslims view their <UNK> to islam i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the <UNK> just as their are <UNK> and <UNK> christians so too there are variations in the intensity of belief and <UNK> among jews and muslims br br when you watch this film you need to have the salt <UNK> on hand one grain will not be enough you'll need more please use your own mind and think for yourself research what is presented and <UNK> the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video there is a common thread of political <UNK> among those who put this film together <UNK> a definite bias be your own brain
<START> don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the <UNK> of cinematography when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers leaves a lot to be said i was expecting something better from award winning actor <UNK> del toro the vision that others may have of <UNK> will be <UNK> distorted by such trash as <UNK> a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context see the movie elsa and fred for example but it should not <UNK> the plot the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film
<START> camp with a capital c think of mask and the ace <UNK> movies then <UNK> by 100 this laugh a minute entertainer takes schlock to the level of high art david <UNK> is a genius and govinda is beyond description see it over and over again i insist
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of <UNK> and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u br br this movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think <UNK> <UNK> cut down the role of <UNK> <UNK> br br character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence br br the ideas of <UNK> is also not define and confusing br br a really very big disappointment
<START> this movie starts out with an execution of a <UNK> of witchcraft and his mistress his head is chopped off and buried <UNK> of his body sounds like the thing that wouldn't die doesn't it well it does play out a little like that but once the body is reunited with the head all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly i mean the movie is only <UNK> minutes long and i kept thinking when is it going to end the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of <UNK> the only thing to keep you watching after the head is <UNK> is the fact that there are so many boobs being <UNK> that you really begin to lose track still i want to see a horror movie not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable and don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town there isn't only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily <UNK> they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap
<START> nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time it's being brought to you by the never inevitable fred <UNK> ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn't click as science fiction it's plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine <UNK> wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all that's nearly bare to resist give me a f ing break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn't make this one great i'd like to point out another film called the assault 1996 by jim <UNK> which resembles the identity of <UNK> it illustrates why top notch 1st person femme fatale action movies don't translate well in america sorry <UNK>
<START> this movie was amazing it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director writer sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience the acting was fantastic and can only be <UNK> by the writing and directing of the film this film focuses on the real americans the past generation no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life this film is about loss and <UNK> instead of picking on <UNK> it <UNK> it not as someone who <UNK> you magically but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an <UNK> someone you can trust will not judge you but rather will guide you though your thoughts this movie is all round amazing
<START> although the film is the adaptation of the french play forgot the name sorry it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of <UNK> character this film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness it will display the overwhelming love of life along with human <UNK>
<START> having read during many years about how great this film was how it established <UNK> among the french critics specially the <UNK> <UNK> crowd when i finally watched it about a year ago i found it pretty disappointing but then i guess my expectations were sky high shot in <UNK> black and white this deliberately cerebral film made for tv and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art <UNK> and an off screen narrator as they <UNK> through a series of paintings which are shown in the style of <UNK> <UNK> and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film <UNK> has a similar argument <UNK> is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie but i would say almost any <UNK> story is more interesting than this film
<START> this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill <UNK> he buffalo bill cody and <UNK> jane are the central characters br br as the civil war <UNK> lincoln mentions his concern that the country's <UNK> would be enhanced if people would follow the advice go west young man which mercifully the film didn't <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> as a number of others did but then he gets <UNK> and some <UNK> <UNK> that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians br br in the meantime we see wild bill <UNK> who <UNK> with a small boy while a <UNK> is <UNK> at a <UNK> along the <UNK> wild bill uses a <UNK> knife which he eventually gives to the boy calling it an <UNK> <UNK> which in reality was a different type of knife though both were used throughout the frontier br br <UNK> eventually meets buffalo bill cody who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man cody has just gotten married and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down br br when they arrive at their destination they run into <UNK> jane who has a crush on <UNK> she looks at <UNK> wife and asks buffalo bill is this your <UNK> the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem since one definition of <UNK> was prostitute demille wanted the line in and one of his <UNK> pointed out that in <UNK> <UNK> books about peter rabbit three of the <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify the rabbit of ill virtue it worked the line stayed in br br the indians were getting restless in part because of the superior <UNK> they got from the agent of the eastern <UNK> cody and <UNK> were asked to help <UNK> the area so that troops could get safely through to a <UNK> area cody led the troops <UNK> went to check out the activities of an indian chief who was an old <UNK> and who was leading some of the hostile indians br br <UNK> jane gets captured and <UNK> gets captured trying to save her they are brought to the chief and although neither would talk torture applied to <UNK> breaks <UNK> jane's <UNK> and she tells the route cody is using br br the two are released and <UNK> joins up with cody and his forces in part to alert them they're walking into a trap with <UNK> help they hold off the indian attack br br <UNK> decides to go after the gun <UNK> and finally takes them prisoner as they're waiting for authorities <UNK> is <UNK> down by being shot in the back while playing cards br br there are numerous historic <UNK> in the film but it <UNK> the flavor of legend pretty good for the 1930s
<START> i don't know what it is with these brady kids first barry williams <UNK> <UNK> about having sexy with his tv sister maureen <UNK> then about dating his tv mom <UNK> <UNK> then susan cindy olsen does music for a bunch of porno movies then mike bobby <UNK> gets in trouble for drunk driving finally maureen <UNK> <UNK> and eve jan <UNK> might have had a little same sex <UNK> on the side now christopher peter knight is pursued by a beautiful young model in her early <UNK> during his <UNK> on the surreal life which at first was fun to watch and now they are married and in a very <UNK> and hostile relationship the last episode where she <UNK> for a bunch of nude photographs with another naked girl for a <UNK> to give to christopher for his birthday was not a good move on her part and he dealt with it in a very mature fashion just picking up and leaving to clear his head i think he was always <UNK> to her every need and now he's finally taking a stand and i hate to say it but i think she <UNK> him <UNK> the way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she <UNK> him for every little thing also she talks openly about having <UNK> with other women and it is obvious she still sleeps around on him with women and men which is not something any self <UNK> human being should do when already married to someone if this were a man talking down to his wife like that and going out every night <UNK> and having sex with other people everyone would be <UNK> behind the wife to leave him why should this be any different what started out as a cute little crush on another reality show <UNK> into a huge disaster <UNK> as beautiful as she is is like another britney spears and lindsay <UNK> clearly in need of some therapy because she cries like a baby over so many silly things i feel sorry for her but chris needs to rid himself of her because he is a good man who cannot afford to be <UNK> like this
<START> this is one of may all time favourite films parker <UNK> character is over the top entertaining and the <UNK> <UNK> won't be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and <UNK> world br br if you're a library student rent this then buy the poster and hang it on your wall the soundtrack is highly <UNK> too i've shown this film to more library friends than any other they all fall in love with it
<START> end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very <UNK> intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn't make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering br br the end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever seen and that's saying something i've seen <UNK>
<START> because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money a remake of heaven can wait which was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat rich dead man but are shown coming from rock himself as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong the movie is not funny poorly shot the acting is weak at best go rent heaven can wait and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game
<START> what a brilliant film i will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter at a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too but neither of these <UNK> are flaws in any way cry freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black <UNK> steve biko in his struggles to <UNK> south africa to the horrors of the apartheid it is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko i may be wrong but although it is <UNK> story it is told in the perspective of woods so woods is an important character in conveying <UNK> story to the world br br cry freedom visually looks amazing with the show stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot george <UNK> music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes it was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes the script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the <UNK> attack of the south african citizens or <UNK> death the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch but is <UNK> by how it is shot performed and written and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well br br the performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn't a single bad performance regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in denzel washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as biko and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of <UNK> and the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note penelope <UNK> is lovely as <UNK> wife wendy and she is a great actress anyway out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me one was timothy west who <UNK> his role as captain <UNK> the other was the ever exceptional john <UNK> in a brilliantly chilling cameo role as <UNK> lord richard <UNK> direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual br br overall a truly wonderful film ambitious and long it is but never <UNK> to be compelling powerful and <UNK> moving a definite winner from lord richard attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> there wasn't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after i left the cinema having seen this gem of a film in a sold out house as part of this year's <UNK> film festival and the tears shed were all of laughter this film was hilarious there's no other way of saying this there wasn't one boring bit in it i laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of french <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> was absolutely terrific a great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it the performance was of course completely over the top but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well equally great was charlotte <UNK> who i love to see a lot and the mother was also a very strong performance the sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script wise but apart from that there is nothing to <UNK> about i had a great afternoon seeing this film while <UNK> was drowning in rain outside and i wish films like this from france would get a regular release in germany but the <UNK> is this country don't seem to understand that the french make good films i at least can't wait to find a dvd which offers subtitles hello australia please because that film i need at home to watch several more times
<START> its too bad a lot of people didn't understand this and the next episode br br but don't worry ill explain it too you br br this episode is split in 2 parts br br first part is tony's dream in his coma second part is what happens in real life br br now what people didn't understand is that tony's dream is more then just a dream in this episode its about his <UNK> for his death he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself thus he <UNK> all his <UNK> with this world you will notice what i'm saying at the doctor scene where tony says he has lost his <UNK> which contains his life they makers really did a superb job of <UNK> they're own thoughts of what happens when you die br br if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing with great spiritual meanings br br like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb br br only thing i didn't understand was what the role where of the monks gonna re watch it till i get this br br anyways this episode really touched me and i don't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience br br 10 10 no doubt
<START> <UNK> <UNK> sucks the life out of another famous property the violence is watered down the stories are formulaic the animation is bad the music is obnoxious and repetitive and frankly the show just isn't funny br br at the time h b put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not thus <UNK> and <UNK> appear in a recurring segment as <UNK> hey <UNK> is popular and the <UNK> are popular put 'em together and you can't miss also in an apparent ripoff of private benjamin <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> have a regular segment that features them as new army <UNK> seriously why br br adding to the annoyance factor are the public service <UNK> in every episode standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> on crossing the street safely <UNK> and are you ready for this the dangers of smoking i swear i'm not making that up br br the only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that jack <UNK> the voice of <UNK> from the early days continues the role here br br worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old <UNK> shorts otherwise avoid at all costs
<START> don't listen to <UNK> <UNK> critics on this one this is a gem young rich joan and her brother find themselves <UNK> after their father dies and now they have to work for a living she naturally becomes a reporter and he just as naturally a driver for the mob by wild co <UNK> their careers meet head on thanks to gangster clark gable in the meantime there is the chance for a <UNK> underwear swim for a bunch of pretty young things and for joan to do a couple of <UNK> dance numbers with all the grace of a steam <UNK> br br but none of this is supposed to be taken seriously it's all good fun from those wonderful pre code days when hollywood was really naughty joan looks great and displays much of the emotional range that would give her career such <UNK> thank god she stopped the dancing gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster he wasn't a star yet and so didn't have to be the hero great to see him playing something different and william <UNK> is excellent as the poor confused brother and there are some great montages and tracking shots courtesy of director harry <UNK> who moves the piece on with a cracking pace and an occasional <UNK> to the audience great fun
<START> i am always <UNK> of taking too instant a dislike to a film look at it a month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something <UNK> remarkable that went <UNK> at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert <UNK> at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself <UNK> <UNK> artistic director of the <UNK> international film festival aided by the film's director and producer gave a spirited <UNK> of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience <UNK> festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very <UNK> and <UNK> ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m a film directors this was not an overly <UNK> film there was a degree of <UNK> sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was <UNK> as were <UNK> <UNK> the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film making on the promise of a controversial movie <UNK> to the war in iraq are contrived over <UNK> and sloppy apart from a general <UNK> to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the <UNK> <UNK> reference marquis de <UNK> as one audience member put it seems a mere <UNK> excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale br br we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with <UNK> who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities <UNK> to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him br br the film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life <UNK> there is a carefully <UNK> scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs <UNK> a <UNK> sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are <UNK> a woman in a back room partly <UNK> and framed in the centre of the screen in the <UNK> of the bare bones flat a dj is more concerned that the girl's screams <UNK> his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark <UNK> of serious <UNK> enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way robert <UNK> with his back to us in the <UNK> br br but the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had a strong reaction to it the <UNK> stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing a reaction but mostly and as far as i can tell the <UNK> reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have <UNK> subjected us to such inferior quality film making director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his <UNK> that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone <UNK> or wastes film while playing <UNK> with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening but i found him as <UNK> as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to <UNK> another to entertain another to inspire i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken <UNK> one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his <UNK> about his job being to tell the truth i am left with the feeling that this was an <UNK> project for a new director or else a <UNK> attempt to put himself on the map by <UNK> publicity for second rate work br br andy <UNK> could paint a tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to <UNK> the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only <UNK> to making high sounding excuses for a publicity seeking film
<START> there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this <UNK> load hey genius <UNK> and <UNK> are from two different places learn something about asian culture the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless this dvd does prove useful i do love my new coaster br br so kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead
<START> there are three kinds of bad films the cheap the boring and the tasteless the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless br br boring films are just well boring if you don't leave quickly enough you fall asleep br br tasteless films actually have their <UNK> but the fact remains that they are <UNK> aids for very sick people br br only the cheap bad films are really funny because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately they way over reached beyond their abilities and available resources br br bo derek is just naturally boring and tasteless fortunately fate and a lack of <UNK> and skill redeem her by making her seem cheap as well this film is hilarious and it may well be the last really funny bad film ever made br br i first saw this in a theater may god forgive me i was laughing so hard i was rolling off my seat and so too with most of the rest of the audience br br it's clear that derek and her husband <UNK> conceived of this film as partly a satire unfortunately the <UNK> clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to pull that off consequently the <UNK> element comes off as some school girl's impression of some gay young man's impression of frank <UNK> impression of the <UNK> in batman trying to pretend he's robin it doesn't fly over our heads it has no clue where any human head might be br br on the other hand there are some supposedly serious moments in this film it is supposed to be an action film remember that are so <UNK> cheesy one wonders if someone <UNK> spoiled milk in one's eye br br as for <UNK> infamous tendency to reveal her breasts i can't imagine a less erotic nudity <UNK> display she is so weird looking with those broad shoulders i can't imagine what any one ever saw in her br br as for the plot such as it is well it isn't derek chases around africa and god alone knows why then her father harris pretends to act in some <UNK> puppet show and then of course there's the <UNK> that seems to have wondered in from <UNK> without knowing that the <UNK> changed probably because he hasn't seen a script apparently no one has br br <UNK> camera work shoddy editing if it weren't for the 3 way with the <UNK> the film would be unbearable br br as it is it's a real hoot
<START> i first saw <UNK> day when i was just 10 years old at home on the movie channel and still remember the impact it made on my life it touched me as no other film had touched me and i remember <UNK> my eyes out br br after the first time i saw it i couldn't find it anywhere else i would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film i guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about because no one and i mean no one knew what i was talking about i searched and searched throughout the years checking video stores shelves and <UNK> cable tv <UNK> but always came up short finally in 1996 i found out i could special order it i did and have probably watched it at least 50 times since and it still makes me cry every time br br <UNK> day is about martin <UNK> a man who is in prison but genuinely a good guy who <UNK> to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy this was a special place where he lived off nature spent time with his dog and was left alone to enjoy life soon into the movie he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake br br it isn't long before the cops find him and <UNK> grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off soon <UNK> and his hostage the 2nd martin become best friends and have many fun adventures together from robbing a toy truck to hi <UNK> a train all on the way to this special lake br br throughout the movie <UNK> has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boy br br i won't ruin the ending for you but i will tell you this movie is a must see it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life i am without a doubt the biggest fan of this movie ever i managed to find the song that the two <UNK> are singing throughout the movie i'm going back to where i come from i'm even planning a trip to canada to see the lake and <UNK> where <UNK> day was filmed crazy i know but that movie just means so much to me

<START> br br cheap looking and ugly this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for one fairly amusing toilet joke christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role jeff daniels and <UNK> hannah avoid <UNK> there is really no reason to make this movie especially since it is <UNK> that one will compare it with robin <UNK> often brilliant <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> br br
<START> this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better the last one heaven can wait was great i suggest you see that one this one is not so great the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today however i don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie it plays like some really bad b movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit com the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad i don't know how they could release this movie like that anyway the last part isn't to bad so wait for the video and see it then
<START> i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex <UNK> john <UNK> then as a bonus the music by <UNK> <UNK> i expected an old school edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america <UNK> i got a <UNK> story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying wtf too many unanswered questions and not enough action the result a potential cult classic got <UNK> down the toilet keitel and <UNK> work well together so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script oh and the <UNK> score ok but not memorable br br overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore keitel fan
<START> it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a <UNK> script fine production values good casting acting all bound together with a fine <UNK> score two roughly contemporary films accomplish this thief of <UNK> 1940 and the adventures of robin hood 1938 some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production <UNK> in england in the summer of 1939 moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander <UNK> was subsequently <UNK> in 1942 here is a unique case of the <UNK> of art <UNK> and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library
<START> scream was wes craven's last decent thriller since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the scream sequels perhaps the genius and the <UNK> devoted to the movie <UNK> all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for <UNK> he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with red eye br br rachel mcadams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel then she meets jackson <UNK> cillian murphy batman beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a <UNK> flight and a bay <UNK> what she doesn't know is he already knows her and he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to <UNK> and meet jackson's demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination br br you're probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes although this is a good old fashioned thriller that's the beauty of it no special effects no cheap make up just classic suspense you feel the desperation and regret with every decision mcadams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position br br as always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance it's either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it cillian murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn't reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to <UNK> jackass isn't so surprising perhaps it would have been more <UNK> to see a nice guy persona like toby maguire <UNK> into evil relentless madman nevertheless cillian murphy after his true identity is established played the role so <UNK> you'd really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked br br don't overlook this feature there are plenty of <UNK> <UNK> moments and heart <UNK> that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at craven's recent pictures if not for the you do it for all the times you'll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and <UNK> on to you wes finally gets it right aside from his trademark <UNK> in suspense red eye is not without its humor as <UNK> replacement <UNK> at the front desk <UNK> to keep the hotel in order it was a relief that red eye wasn't a disappointment instead you'll get the pleasure of seeing mcadams deliver another incredibly talented performance murphy look <UNK> by the minute and craven craft a classic traditional thriller a flight that was <UNK> and would have been the beginning of craven's renaissance had it arrived right after scream
<START> if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director louis <UNK> i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary <UNK> american town in 1979 this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely <UNK> a collection of home movies considering i didn't know any of these people it was even less interesting br br because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey perhaps it was that values aren't as conservative as you might think this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes such as the <UNK> whose son was a draft <UNK> as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine or perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of <UNK> underlying the nice home town as several ugly ideas such as <UNK> jews for financial <UNK> anti black <UNK> and <UNK> all were briefly explored br br the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an <UNK> sort of world was portrayed but when the film makers returned six years later the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan this seemed very <UNK> for several reasons first the 1979 portion was almost 90 of the film and the final 10 only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but <UNK> what about the rest of the folks of this town did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative with only a few <UNK> it seemed suspicious second while it is true that the national debt <UNK> in the <UNK> years so did the gross national product and while <UNK> shows 1979 as a very optimistic period it was far from that as the period from 1974 1980 featured many <UNK> gas sugar etc strikes high <UNK> and general <UNK> while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration the country in general was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years while many in the media <UNK> reagan a popular sport in the 80s the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one sided and agenda driven had the documentary given a more <UNK> coverage of 1985 and hadn't seemed too negative to be believed after all everyone didn't have their lives get worse this defies common sense then i might have thought otherwise br br overall not the wonderful documentary some have <UNK> it to be ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely <UNK> look at 1985 br br by the way is it just me or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired at least in part by this film both are set in similar <UNK> but the latter film was a hilarious <UNK> without all the serious undertones
<START> one of my favorite movies with a very nostalgic ending the movie is about the sullivan family obviously michael sullivan the father is one of the main members of the mafia the killer to say it this way and an expert one one of the kids wants to know the work of his father a terrible mistake so he hides on his father's car and well he sees tom hanks in action to say it this way br br mafia doesn't rules in mafia nobody wins when they want you out they take you out of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house the best car in the world whatever you like but make a wrong work or make something your boss doesn't want and you're fired and killed br br you can see what i mean in the movie sullivan jr sees something he didn't had to see and well almost all his family gets killed for that wrong thing his son did the movie is really entertaining you see how the <UNK> live after being chased by the mafia or kinda of that br br this movie is kinda of sad shows us about revenge those dirty works people do almost everything you like hopefully the guy is reading this comment doesn't works for the mafia and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers br br this movie receives 10 10
<START> during eddie murphy's stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds what is said is women do mr rob this is a character from saturday night live the man responds with shut up bitch unlike the previous post saying the women <UNK> do <UNK> this is incorrect although the post er said he was there they must have a hearing problem despite what the post er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd do mr rob i hope this helps anyone curious out the <UNK> cheers <UNK>
<START> here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life this time the target audience is <UNK> girls the fact of life is <UNK> this animated film created by walt disney pictures apparently with some <UNK> from <UNK> br br it starts with explaining how <UNK> make you grow and develop with the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body especially the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> work and why this all leads to <UNK> it is almost amazing becoming the comic note here how the subject of sex is avoided even the word is never mentioned although <UNK> will pass once i don't really know why i saw this but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time you might want to give it a try
<START> not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the <UNK> <UNK> camps and that's done effectively enough with surprising <UNK> for the time whatever technical flaws exist and there are plenty by watching this you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff again nasty because it's being done north of the <UNK> and not in <UNK> bay br br i don't think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office and if you watch the movies like this one and <UNK> chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films i don't know if it was the people in <UNK> being trapped in the wwii concepts the boys tend to <UNK> a lot or the war or what but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like go tell the <UNK>
<START> a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an <UNK> who has a long term girlfriend of course the <UNK> is very good looking charming etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman watching jean pierre <UNK> character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends it's tragic and you know she's going to end up very hurt but there's nothing you can do <UNK> is brilliant totally empty a blank throughout he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants br br the scene two hours in when <UNK> and <UNK> have made love and the next morning he puts on a record and very <UNK> and <UNK> sings along to <UNK> her is brilliant the what the hell am i doing here with this idiot expression that <UNK> back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come br br it's a long film but see it in one go preferably in a cinema takes a while to get into but then the time just disappears
<START> i spent 5 hours <UNK> in this film nothing i have ever seen comes close to the delicious <UNK> this film left me in never mind females advanced aging <UNK> human fear <UNK> off the screen for your viewing personally engaging to the <UNK> degree the film <UNK> one with an <UNK> shared feeling for our <UNK> i enjoyed this <UNK> with raw wounded <UNK> deep from within it <UNK> a <UNK> shared <UNK> in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain isolation and <UNK> views of self and others the result <UNK> our tepid <UNK> of a bridge away from the <UNK> <UNK> of dead we must encounter the birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit the effort for realism <UNK> with the dark ground of our <UNK> culture
<START> when i first saw this movie i was with my dad he encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites after watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites br br a river runs through it is about two brothers who each take a different path in life norman <UNK> craig <UNK> is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education paul <UNK> brad pitt is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles the movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path br br there is no downside to this movie you will be entertained the whole way through the acting directing and script is all perfect the two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score both of which <UNK> you in the world robert redford creates for you br br this is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic it sure is in my book if you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever
<START> 48 out of <UNK> people found this comment useful and counting br br people are such <UNK> for image and looks as much as for the intellectually hollow <UNK> that <UNK> behind communism che's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the <UNK> that has been spread by <UNK> propaganda such as this movie about him br br i don't know what's worse being captured by one of che's murder <UNK> or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically <UNK> garbage the question isn't why this pet project was made but what took them so long by them i'm referring of course to left wing hollywood and its secret love of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of <UNK> least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an <UNK> biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan <UNK> george clooney barbra streisand even it's a mystery all these overrated artists have often <UNK> themselves in similar politically one sided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and well known communist hasn't been a film topic of theirs yet br br <UNK> has all the <UNK> of an american truth <UNK> story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big budget political fairy tale <UNK> such as malcolm x or gandhi i e almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous <UNK> revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this man's actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent <UNK> who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> only <UNK> the director's lack of sound judgment br br the movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3 hour mark so it's quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his <UNK> <UNK> was up to the task if you think the film's length <UNK> that a bulk of che's life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on che's last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of <UNK> alleged <UNK> <UNK> don't have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly <UNK> director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che's earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of <UNK> people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this over praised <UNK> would have easily fit not one but two complete <UNK> into a 4 hour movie br br soderbergh in a sense becomes an <UNK> by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than 90 of guevara by <UNK> this kind of historical <UNK> <UNK> ignoring the ugly truth god <UNK> he should <UNK> the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a <UNK> a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to <UNK> but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are <UNK> of the worst kind such people often have a <UNK> contempt for the <UNK> what a stupid term they're supposedly <UNK> with br br half of all students around the world wear che's image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless <UNK> very often young people who think that by having this man's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only <UNK> one's overall <UNK> and total <UNK> in self education wouldn't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his her face to the world wearing che's by now cliché image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those che <UNK> probably know more about <UNK> blue hair than they'll ever read up on about <UNK> <UNK> dead ally br br after everything <UNK> been done in the name of marx one would think that these <UNK> ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn <UNK> <UNK> kim <UNK> <UNK> pot castro <UNK> <UNK> the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion ruined physically and or mentally through this system so none of that matters huh br br the fact that del

<START> as a hammer <UNK> i was <UNK> the time when i would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it holiday on the <UNK> i had seen one the <UNK> the film and thought it one of the worst films i have ever seen it was full of all the awful comedy that plagued british tv screens around the early 70's br br i am ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this film that i laughed at i don't know if it was because i was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations knowing how they would react i found <UNK> particularly funny although i could swear at no point in the trilogy does he say his <UNK> i'll get you butler br br having watched holiday on the <UNK> the jokes were starting to wear thin and these three films could be compared to an early hammer trilogy dick barton in that the second film made is the best although this is probably the only way they could be compared br br the only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the tv series who will no doubt enjoy this and hammer <UNK> like myself to the <UNK> i would say that this film isn't that bad and i can certainly think of worse hammer comedies
<START> this is an honest attempt to make a <UNK> sweet love story the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series <UNK> this lovely sweet <UNK> com is a timeless treasure the comparisons are obvious jimmy stewart plays a hapless but <UNK> straight kim <UNK> plays a <UNK> blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch she <UNK> herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved <UNK> her <UNK> familiar is being cared for by her beloved aunt you'll recognize the aunt from murder by death this movie is fun and <UNK> sweet bearing some spectacular wit and a nice <UNK> feel worth a look
<START> annoying static comedy with a painfully miscast peter sellers as a smarmy self centered <UNK> who always has his way with the ladies a major <UNK> on <UNK> filmography and even worse a film that seems to have been made solely to satisfy the ego of its star
<START> a meteor crashes into <UNK> lake the heat from the impact causing a <UNK> egg to <UNK> br br alright so the plot is just trash but despite its obvious low budget this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster on the loose films in existence there are also some good moments of humor in an age filled so called <UNK> which are no more than laughable men in rubber suit creations or <UNK> dressed up in <UNK> and forced to rip each other to pieces cheap exploitation style it's refreshing to discover that the <UNK> in this little gem is an excellent <UNK> style stop motion creature br br quite a hard film to find but it's worth finding
<START> i disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed masterpiece of the german new wave br br 1 there are major flaws in simple exposition in the basic communication of critical plot points as relating to <UNK> abortion and the secret contract between <UNK> and her husband how many viewers understood that the husband agreed in exchange for substantial financial <UNK> not to return to and <UNK> his wife until <UNK> was dead br br 2 the ending is highly unsatisfying because <UNK> and accidental the original screenplay called for maria to commit suicide after the reading of <UNK> will on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to <UNK> in the final version however maria only runs water from a <UNK> across her <UNK> in a gesture of suicide maria is then <UNK> blown up rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self <UNK> and moral compromise br br 3 fassbinder seeks to <UNK> <UNK> the public on the private the political on the personal contrary to what the critics and experts <UNK> i don't think it works merely <UNK> historic radio news or the sound of the <UNK> of german <UNK> in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama br br the selfish ambition of <UNK> rise from poverty to <UNK> is meant to parallel the so called economic miracle of <UNK> germany maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and <UNK> of her time and place but is in reality unoriginal and <UNK> women have been <UNK> their independence by using sex for self <UNK> for ages br br 4 lastly there are several instances of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> drug addiction and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have had their effect unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen music is clumsily <UNK> in places and melodramatic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for acting br br strangely for a movie <UNK> a country for <UNK> collective <UNK> of the holocaust it itself never mentions it once
<START> sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies they don't come any <UNK> and <UNK> than this as harry <UNK> through a series of violent <UNK> with the bad guys getting their just <UNK> which is just the way i like it great story too and <UNK> directed by clint himself excellent entertainment
<START> i couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was the screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of seven not by changing the story i think mainly through the cinematography the cinematography was the only thing that i found to be holding back the film on the other hand the pacing was absolutely on point whoever worked on the editing really did their job well and i thought bill paxton did a great job of directing now away from the technical stuff br br this movie threw me for a loop spoiler ahead all along i really felt that bill paxton was crazy and then when adam finally took the fbi agent to the rose garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was i got thrown for a loop i had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too without any words spoken simply by touch sees it again with adam and asks him how he knew my dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost <UNK> idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out <UNK> <UNK> so to speak knowing their sins and crimes already i don't <UNK> an eye for an eye so i didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing god's work instead i chose to believe that they were both <UNK> and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to disturbed them <UNK> also that was my interpretation but the <UNK> thing about the film was it's like a house of cards and a never ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you've sat through it's definitely one of those movies where i'd love to be able to meet the writer so i could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all were they crazy and psychotic were they simply <UNK> and took license because of it or did they have some sort of appearance from god and if so was it god or the devil <UNK> himself as god my friends and i found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie br br a definitely <UNK> and thought <UNK> film with some very disturbing but certainly not <UNK> elements to it it's not a perfect film but it definitely is it's own thing great directorial work and acting by bill paxton and the child that played <UNK> was extremely good i hope he doesn't end up <UNK> to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise i gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the <UNK> that make a film but i would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something although i can't <UNK> what was off and if it hadn't have been the movie would have gone to an even higher level still a definite recommend especially for those that are <UNK>
<START> <UNK> may go down as one of the single most under rated movies ever made br br a stellar <UNK> cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone <UNK> it up there was no one <UNK> kline showed wit and great physical comedy goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking i could just go on br br do not pass this movie by
<START> we always watch american movies with their particular accents from each region south west etc we have the same here all foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture besides american and european almost dominate the cinematographic industry br br this movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn't figured even for those who live in a big city like <UNK> <UNK> all actors are <UNK> and they are very realistic the camera give us an idea of their confuse world the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world br br it's a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home
<START> from beginning to end this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen the characterizations and interactions between the title character and <UNK> <UNK> character are pure torture the <UNK> as metaphor gimmick is so <UNK> that it borders on cliche yet director <UNK> treats every <UNK> turn as if it were something profoundly important br br maybe there's some value for a <UNK> re playing of some of the scenes such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female for goof value but even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey
<START> hi all i am a chess <UNK> since the age of about 6 i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film br br in this film the central character reflects a real chess player called <UNK> von <UNK> who committed suicide in <UNK> he is famous for a game he played against <UNK> where a beautiful combination was played by <UNK> instead of <UNK> he simply walked out of the <UNK> hall never to return br br the social <UNK> of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious <UNK> you sometimes get in chess <UNK> chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice and you can sometimes end up <UNK> in other areas of life a major example of this is the chess legend bobby <UNK> although a genius he was also very disturbed in many ways br br in the film a world championship match is depicted as between an italian <UNK> and luzhin the format is a <UNK> which actually the world <UNK> body of <UNK> has sometimes employed as a format itself going from <UNK> players to just 2 in the final but this was a group <UNK> which also depicts a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each other br br the position before <UNK> makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself in fact i have done a youtube video about it for you to explore the winning combination in detail enjoy http uk youtube com watch v <UNK> best wishes <UNK>
<START> cassavetes was clearly an intelligent sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films he wanted to be an auteur to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema for that i applaud him br br unfortunately as a member of his audience i cannot applaud a woman under the influence cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic an insane woman and somehow managed to craft a dull film filled with lengthy ad <UNK> <UNK> and drawn out scenes he seems to have had a gift for capturing the <UNK> moments of a person's life on film and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the <UNK> run and run this <UNK> would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something <UNK> real or even a <UNK> of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not yet i found the performances particularly <UNK> to be artificial i never believed for a moment that she was really insane i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed yet i've never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence she played it like a very obnoxious <UNK> woman who drinks a lot and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once at the beginning but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film there are some moments in which she <UNK> into something real but those moments are few and far between she fails to sustain a <UNK> mentally disturbed character again i applaud her efforts but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true br br <UNK> audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly just to prove that they <UNK> it ' but don't be <UNK> by the hype judge for yourself you don't have to pretend to like it br br like woody allen john cassavetes could be accused of <UNK> in his film making seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared <UNK> and <UNK> self indulgent but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie if cassavetes had employed some self discipline and a sharp pair of editing <UNK> a woman under the influence could have stood a chance but what's the point of making a <UNK> film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art house <UNK> and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti establishment <UNK> without <UNK> anything down i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot instead of presenting a string of 30 minute long scenes of ad <UNK> arguments if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans you're just reaching the already converted watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it if you are truly moved and fascinated by it good for you
<START> it's hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper <UNK> for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon <UNK> through corridors which becomes slightly tedious br br i was amazed to see marcus <UNK> in the acting credits wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like <UNK> goldberg it must be an <UNK> and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker br br the story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so then it'll be enjoyable
<START> this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england so that says a lot right there the tension when we have to find out whether or not <UNK> is staying is amazing though the upside is seeing the nice secretary sheila in her <UNK> table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr rat face this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal there is also a watch that gets <UNK> away and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of the sixth sense only a lot more dull and british add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr rat which results in nothing plus the <UNK> of a lot of people plus a cat and you have yourself <UNK> a british movie the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there <UNK>
<START> the first point that calls the attention in for ever <UNK> is the absence of a plot summary in imdb the explanation is simple since there is no story screenplay plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie jean luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most <UNK> films i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about but there are <UNK> that <UNK> to justify or explain this messy movie and it is funny to read their reviews br br my vote is one br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> forever <UNK>
<START> i didn't know this was a silent movie with narration i don't care for silent movies the corny humor <UNK> lighting and film etc i'm sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it it was about chapter 8 before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen maybe this appeals to the sci fi crowd the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater <UNK> <UNK> narrated this movie the one enjoyable aspect of the movie no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story i cannot recommend this movie
<START> i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for though it has its confusing parts of the plot it doesn't greatly <UNK> with your understanding of the movie that being said if you're not open to more liberal political ideas then this probably isn't the movie for you i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding each character has their funny moments and the audience at the <UNK> film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area but that's intentionally done john cusack is right in that although it's set in the future it really makes you see the present
<START> nick cage is gates a treasure hunter oh excuse me treasure <UNK> whatever that means who is <UNK> from a long line of treasure hunters one of his <UNK> had been given a clue to the <UNK> of a huge treasure that our <UNK> fathers most if not all <UNK> had decided to hide because they just didn't want to <UNK> their independence all that badly br br the first clue turns out to be in a long lost ship hidden in the <UNK> gates and his crew <UNK> of <UNK> ian sean bean movie <UNK> <UNK> justin <UNK> of the immortal <UNK> and a couple of <UNK> <UNK> enter the <UNK> hold of the ship they immediately <UNK> out tons of <UNK> all over the floor not that this is significant in any way at last they find the clue a <UNK> is <UNK> over it and it turns out to be a <UNK> with writing on it sort of don't ask me to explain br br it's a <UNK> and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly <UNK> at not finding the actual treasure gates wanders around <UNK> to himself about the meaning of the <UNK> in this frozen <UNK> hold while the crew just stands around slack <UNK> i mean come on someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of coming all the way to the freaking <UNK> and not finding anything interesting but they just stand there as gates enters his own world solving the <UNK> br br the next clue turns out to be on the <UNK> of independence ian decides to steal it gates is appalled various characters deliver <UNK> obvious exposition get used to it all this leads to <UNK> <UNK> pulling a gun on gates and the <UNK> going off in a big explosion oh that's why they <UNK> all the <UNK> huh ian and his henchmen make their escape and gates and movie <UNK> <UNK> walk nine miles in <UNK> <UNK> to an <UNK> village in order to stop them br br to stop them gates concludes after trying the fbi and super <UNK> <UNK> chase diane <UNK> gates and <UNK> must steal it themselves <UNK> then tells gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the <UNK> because it's so <UNK> with metal and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah gates then tells <UNK> that there's an opportunity to steal it from the <UNK> room does <UNK> know what the <UNK> room is gates asks a place where they make <UNK> and <UNK> i am not kidding that's the actual line <UNK> doesn't deliver it like a joke either so <UNK> does all this research about the library of <UNK> and the <UNK> and water and <UNK> <UNK> but doesn't know what the <UNK> room is this pretty much <UNK> what level this script is on br br to make the rest of this short gates does in fact make off with the d of i in a ridiculous break in that could only happen in a movie i also hate the way they depict computer <UNK> technology in movies full of improbable and <UNK> graphics and <UNK> <UNK> chase ends up <UNK> along for <UNK> sake and as an obvious love interest angle at one point the three of them on the run from the law discuss all their plans really <UNK> in a clothing store surrounded by people br br a series of clues and the kidnapping of <UNK> father played by a <UNK> jon voight leads good guys and bad guys alike to a huge indiana jones fun house located underneath new york city odd that the subway <UNK> never found this thing gates and gates senior lead ian off on a wild <UNK> chase ian believes they're trapped in a <UNK> de <UNK> and leaves them there however after they're gone <UNK> asks how they're going to get out gates br br oh boy br br <UNK> a button and a door opens no i'm serious a button like they might have on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in an office building good thing he knew where that was anyway after some more <UNK> <UNK> they find this immense treasure room remember this is all underneath manhattan full of all sorts of <UNK> golden things <UNK> gets to deliver a really stupid line again and fbi officer harvey keitel <UNK> them <UNK> sean bean and allows the two chemistry less leads to get married br br for any viewer i think it would be hard to ignore all the exposition the leaps of logic and the stereotyped characters for very long though some of its exposition involves nice history lessons inserted into conversation at random moments i'd like more conversations like that in my life
<START> i may have seen an episode or 2 when the show originally aired but when i watched 1 episode on netflix i was also hooked i watched the whole series in like 2 days i really liked gary <UNK> character first he's thoroughly <UNK> then you start liking the character these things have a thousand uses his <UNK> andy griffith meets charles <UNK> meets satan is great charming charismatic smarmy and uh kind of dangerous and by kind of i mean really i wanna be like him when i grow up lucas black is great too the accents are great too anyway i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it
<START> this film is one of the more <UNK> black and white films of this time in the early 1930's before the <UNK> code was <UNK> it's the story of a young beautiful woman moving to new york and making her way to the top of the business by using her body as a tool to get there br br barbara stanwyck plays the young and beautiful lily powers who indeed does a fairly well job with her performance lily moves to new york and makes her way up the business place by sleeping with all the men stanwyck does an outstanding performance as being a strong woman who uses men as one time deals hardly any emotion towards them playing them as if they were <UNK> lily powers is a woman who doesn't have love on her mind just power and money br br i thought this movie to be a little bit different then other films i have seen because there is hardly any background music heard i believe it is only because this is when people were first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the film the few times the music is heard is during the beginning as we are shown how she makes her way up the chain the filming and different scenes were something fantastic the director of this film did all the right angles and all the right tricks making this film full of realism br br this film was all together an alright movie the ending to this movie wasn't as good as it should have been but it didn't entirely ruin it baby face had its slow moving scenes throughout the movie and perhaps a few predictable parts such as who she will sleep with next but this is a lovable movie that can be watched more then once and suggested to some people and friends
<START> wow <UNK> <UNK> has followed up <UNK> and z boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big wave surfing culture in america <UNK> together <UNK> <UNK> footage along with interviews from surfing legends we are transported into the daring and free spirited life of the early <UNK> whose sheer passion for the sport <UNK> an industry that today touches the lives of millions br br it's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth you can feel the respect <UNK> has for this group as we hear accounts of greg <UNK> <UNK> from a pack of <UNK> fellow surfers on the beach to <UNK> challenge 50 foot <UNK> off <UNK> north coast or jeff clark surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california and the <UNK> history of <UNK> hamilton today's surfing icon hearing greg <UNK> <UNK> refer to hamilton as the best <UNK> ever sent chills up my spine br br as an aside <UNK> clark and others were at the sundance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> described himself as an old over the hill <UNK> he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the film br br riding giants pays homage to these extraordinary <UNK> while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the <UNK> and terrifying power of the waves they seek to <UNK> the gut wrenching <UNK> drops required to get into them and the almost <UNK> combination of <UNK> and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster <UNK> br br all this and the movie has more for those of us that didn't live in california in the 60's we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture and to my surprise the impact of the movie <UNK> on surfing <UNK> also weaves in a <UNK> on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of <UNK> in equipment i'm not a <UNK> but like the rest of the sundance audience i was absolutely captivated by this film <UNK> is <UNK> his claim as the big <UNK> of american documentaries
<START> this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but i didn't it seemed to be trying way too hard to be <UNK> all flash with no content it has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but <UNK> them all together and it becomes an <UNK> task just to sit through it i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video <UNK> and the fact that i'm a big shakespeare fan but i was very disappointed i just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring
<START> it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any <UNK> men after all ben <UNK> was three times a widower with a son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam <UNK> and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western br br perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the <UNK> people have relationships some go good some not so good it's just life and we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the <UNK> <UNK> intact but that's if bonanza were done today br br but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of <UNK> success was the noble <UNK> ben <UNK> and his <UNK> sons ben <UNK> was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense <UNK> spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in a <UNK> br br the <UNK> became and still are an american institution i <UNK> more people cared about this family than the <UNK> just the popularity that bonanza has in <UNK> <UNK> to that br br <UNK> roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show <UNK> has it he didn't care for the noble <UNK> characters which he felt <UNK> on <UNK> perhaps if it were done now he'd have liked it better in the way i describe br br this was just the beginning for michael <UNK> how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit <UNK> also has highway to heaven and little house on the <UNK> where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the <UNK> br br when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan <UNK> left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david <UNK> tim <UNK> and ben <UNK> adopted young mitch <UNK> but big loyal but a little thick <UNK> was easily the most lovable of the <UNK> his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family br br so the <UNK> of the <UNK> have passed into history i got a real taste of how america took the <UNK> to heart when i visited the real virginia city it doesn't look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake <UNK> just about where you see the <UNK> on the map at the opening credits is the <UNK> home the set <UNK> and open as a tourist attraction like 21 baker street for sherlock holmes fans the <UNK> and the <UNK> are real br br and if they weren't real they should have been
<START> tony scott can make good films and bad personally i think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother but this is quite possibly his best film br br what makes this film so great is that scott gives denzel on <UNK> form better than training day and the revelation who is <UNK> fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and <UNK> the set up is absolutely not boring although it takes time it is involving and takes us on a little journey into the characters including a superb role for <UNK> mitchell as the mother this all serves to make the action so much more effective as we are so invested in the characters for all their all too obvious weaknesses this film has you on the edge for its entirety and doesn't cop out at the end either br br the film would of course be nothing without washington i often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there i can only really think of one daniel day lewis who has more on screen power these days this film should have been huge given his status and the strength of his performance and the quality of the film it just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the <UNK> it ends up going straight to video i wish i'd got the chance to see this on the big screen
<START> in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the very low middle class dysfunctional and <UNK> family of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the teenager <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> have deep secrets the religious <UNK> is indeed a hit man hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he has a lover the very <UNK> woman <UNK> martha <UNK> and he wants to <UNK> going to the country with her <UNK> has a young lover <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> who delivers <UNK> for his father's butcher shop <UNK> is a common sixteen years old teenager of the <UNK> having active sexual life smoking grass and loving heavy metal when <UNK> is killed and <UNK> in their neighborhood the lives of the members of the family change br br <UNK> <UNK> is a great low budget brazilian movie that pictures the life in the <UNK> of a big brazilian city the story is very real uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big brazilian cities drug dealers hit men fanatic religious <UNK> people hopeless teenagers etc has many plot points and a surprising end and the characters have excellent performances acting very natural and making the story totally believable the camera follows the characters giving a great dynamics to the film in the extras of the dvd the director <UNK> <UNK> explains that his screenplay had no lines only the description of the situations and was partially <UNK> only one week before the beginning of the shootings the actors have <UNK> in <UNK> and they used lots of <UNK> being the reason for such natural acting my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> against everybody
<START> yet another colourful excuse for men in rubber suits to <UNK> with each other this time around time <UNK> from the future arrive in 1992 and <UNK> a few people to go back with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of godzilla thus saving a future japan from destruction but having accomplished this task the time <UNK> are revealed to be a bunch of double <UNK> whose own creature goes on the rampage and with no godzilla to stop <UNK> <UNK> it all sounds very silly and it probably is but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good too unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish rather than <UNK> rubbish and the movie turns out to be just as dull as its predecessors look out for the shaky spielberg in joke
<START> simon's best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene <UNK> and given life by the immense talents of lemmon and matthau no one delivers these lines better no one times them better nobody does it better
<START> this whole film should have lasted 45 minutes maximum although an interesting concept theme it really did not develop as a story once the initial idea of a brave stupid bomb <UNK> expert cowboy are introduced and this happens very early in the film the rest is <UNK> characters were not explored and aspects of the location and politics were ignored there was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment and the difficulties in <UNK> between friend and <UNK> but the way in which the unit <UNK> stretched belief individual performances were good and special effects were adequate but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content
<START> wow a danish movie with this kind of content i mean the actors the story the pictures the <UNK> everything was where it should be br br and a danish <UNK> house producing those <UNK> wow this is like the 2nd or 3rd time a danish fx has produces visual effects in that quality br br spoiler ahead the twist with the ghostly children in the submarine was quite good but generally i did not feel the big chill which i would expect from a ghost movie end of spoiler br br but anyway this is a danish movie which i as a <UNK> can be proud of br br the only bad about this is that it wasn't a danish director but a swedish
<START> this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didn't have to pay for it in short dumb ass movie don't see it but then again thats my opinion
<START> a very enjoyable film providing you know how to watch old musicals mysteries it may not come close to agatha christie or even thin man mysteries as a film noir but it's much more interesting than your typical boy meets girl or let's put on a show <UNK> musical as a musical it's no busby <UNK> or freed unit but it can boost the classic <UNK> for two and the weird sweet marijuana the film runs in real time during a stage show opening night of the <UNK> where a murder and soon another is discovered <UNK> is the murderer found out before the curtain falls sure but the search is fun even though somewhat predictable and marred by <UNK> of comic relief luckily in the shape of the <UNK> <UNK> of the chorus girls toby wing the stupid cop is just a bit too stupid the leading hero is just a bit too likable the leading lady a bit too <UNK> the bitchy <UNK> donna bit too bitchy and the <UNK> <UNK> a bit too self <UNK> but as stereotypes go they are pretty stylish there's a <UNK> of really gorgeous chorus girls who are chosen even better than the girls for a busby <UNK> musical of the same period who sometimes tend to be a bit on the <UNK> side yes this film could have been much better than it is and the duke <UNK> number is an embarrassment but if you enjoy diving into old movies this will prove to be a tremendously <UNK> trip
<START> nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction this is the case with the <UNK> tomb br br the script is <UNK> ideas from older better universal horror flicks like dracula and frankenstein the direction is trite and stale the acting is mediocre even <UNK> <UNK> is feeble compared to tom <UNK> in the <UNK> hand and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy <UNK> vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film br br universal realized how bad this movie was and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as the <UNK> ghost with a much better script and better director the result was likely the best film in their four film mummy cycle although not anywhere near as good as karl <UNK> 1932 original br br <UNK> footage raises this film to a 3 the new stuff is a 2 at best dick <UNK> and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters <UNK> off so they wouldn't have to appear in dreck like this anymore
<START> this is full of major spoilers so beware br br <UNK> de <UNK> always suffers in comparison to the two films louise brooks made with g w <UNK> <UNK> box and diary of a lost girl but in some ways <UNK> is the quintessential brooks film here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her <UNK> collaboration what <UNK> has that the <UNK> films don't is music in this early french film the whole louise brooks <UNK> is fleshed out <UNK> with a <UNK> of image song and music the <UNK> is what seems most associated with brooks she was the first to dance it in europe but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango the tango also plays a plot point in <UNK> being the music she <UNK> with on her short rise to stardom after becoming miss europe later when she has <UNK> her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre the longing for her <UNK> fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to <UNK> the documentary about her life looking for <UNK> a film narrated by shirley <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> quality of the tango <UNK> louise <UNK> strong headed but elegant and erotic <UNK> br br the song je <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film but a very good one by the way <UNK> voice was not dubbed for the film by edith <UNK> as some have claimed <UNK> was born in <UNK> and wasn't discovered until <UNK> the song however is what <UNK> character <UNK> sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test which she views with the producers and <UNK> who intend to shape her career it continues on screen after husband andre who has followed her to the screening room shoots and kills her in a single shot with <UNK> dead body in <UNK> at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly <UNK> as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen the murder weapon still smoking he subtly smiles she is now his forever and by association <UNK> br br <UNK> louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after <UNK> de <UNK> so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well this film really <UNK> the brooks <UNK> more so than the <UNK> films which are superior films no doubt it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the cult of the movies where people like brooks james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive
<START> i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i've ever seen i did not laugh once throughout this short and it's a bugs bunny cartoon for <UNK> sake bugs bunny cartoons are always funny not boring alas this short turns out to be good night elmer another incredibly boring jones short with the addition of bugs bunny br br the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff this cartoon on the other hand is <UNK> with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon there's too much dialogue the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its <UNK> but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue at one point elmer finishes eating dinner and comments that was <UNK> <UNK> good <UNK> of <UNK> possibly the most redundant dialogue i've ever heard in a cartoon characters reading text out loud in the later era woody <UNK> cartoons doesn't count in my book even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this br br <UNK> pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me but if you've sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few <UNK> during his career you might enjoy it
<START> i give this marriage 3 years and thats <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> mouth spoiled controlling loud and her <UNK> sexual past makes me laugh she tells chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip <UNK> he married her chris has low self <UNK> and from a different time <UNK> i have nothing against <UNK> <UNK> but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending her mother said he was an old <UNK> and thinks this is his last attempt to <UNK> his youth here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce i don't think his old brady family is gonna fit into his new life i see them being shut out chris said his friends were more important than his family the supported him and was there for him
<START> what a complete waste of time the movie starts as a clone of the saw series but with even worse acting melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end it just doesn't happen it's a total wrestler ending with none of the good acting i can't believe i spent the time watching this it's not fun as some people put it a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first
<START> 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an <UNK> start the <UNK> talented tom <UNK> was involved in the project this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular and that's exactly what happened the show remains one of the <UNK> funniest <UNK> shows made in a very long time every line facial expression casting choice scene all <UNK> of perfection there was not one episode after which i thought man that wasn't as good as the rest each one was a standout again this is the kind of <UNK> that we've come to expect from tom for those who don't know tom <UNK> is the director of ace <UNK> first movie the nutty professor first one and liar liar quite a <UNK> he's a producer here not a director but his magic touch is felt in every episode the family consists of br br the father paul <UNK> john ritter nice slightly neurotic can be a <UNK> from time to time works as a sports writer john unfortunately passed away in 2003 leaving a fond memory and near sure <UNK> <UNK> by the suits br br the mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> come on who didn't fall in love with <UNK> when she played <UNK> on married with children al <UNK> was our hero we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had but without <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lazy lifestyle al would've probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that <UNK> life actually caused him to be <UNK> was a <UNK> back then and still is a <UNK> now instead of a <UNK> and just as <UNK> as ever <UNK> is the conservative mom and loving wife i know it sounds boring but <UNK> she fits perfectly br br the <UNK> blonde daughter bridget played to perfection by <UNK> <UNK> almost never has an idiot been played so well aside of <UNK> on arrested development bridget may well be a shoe in for any awards given to this <UNK> bridget is shallow self centered not very bright and a tad <UNK> in his look she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo perfection one of the high points of the show br br the overlooked geeky daughter <UNK> amy <UNK> a <UNK> and a geek she gets no love from life or circumstances feels overlooked under appreciated and neglected most of the time she's <UNK> younger sister in reality she's older than her and the <UNK> extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless <UNK> to much of our amusement br br the son <UNK> martin <UNK> was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter then john passes new characters come and <UNK> is not the wise cracking verbal trouble maker that he used to that went mostly to david <UNK> character br br those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter unfortunately enough the insanely hilarious larry miller one of my favorites did not get lots of screen time he played paul's co worker <UNK> after an <UNK> <UNK> cost ritter his life in 2003 september <UNK> the show was on <UNK> for a while no one thought it could come back but it did later on with a couple of new <UNK> this began the second phase of the show and the new characters were br br the strict confident school principal ed adam arkin i saw adam here and there on talk shows this was the first time that i saw him do anything impressed is the word i use his performance was very impressive sad he wasn't brought in earlier he also plays <UNK> potential love interest after paul passes the <UNK> progress towards this point which would've sounded crazy at the beginning earns the creators lots of praise it was done slowly carefully and excellently with constant respect paid to the paul ritter br br the attitude grandpa jim <UNK> james garner a surprisingly welcome addition to the series he was cannon fodder for endless <UNK> jokes mainly by br br the 35 year old unemployed wise cracking half brother of the mom <UNK> played to insanely funny heights by david spade i knew spade was funny i just didn't know he was this funny somehow <UNK> very familiar presence is <UNK> inside his character as opposed to a <UNK> character which is understandable since he's a comic and he's on a comedy show this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david <UNK> appearances in movies talk shows and functions award shows etc and delivering a superb <UNK> of <UNK> voice and comedy style except that it is spade by that i mean you realize he's not trying to play someone else or a whole new character he's being the goofy funny spade we've come to know and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top every line he <UNK> every sarcasm he <UNK> all classics literally spade was crazy funny so so funny br br the show's humor and drama were both <UNK> after the show was back but audiences thought john passed it ain't gonna be the same anymore this is understandable considering we are talking about a group of people american viewers who gave <UNK> <UNK> a free ride but caused andy <UNK> controls the universe to be cancelled in no time as the show's quality <UNK> its ratings <UNK> soon it was no more sadly br br and i saved the best for last fans of married with children are in for a treat and boy what a treat it was i still <UNK> just remembering it it's a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it even if i <UNK> do it under the spoiler <UNK> suffice it to say that it's something you'll never forget i know i won't
<START> it's a cooking competition show <UNK> it's not going to be the japanese version br br the show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the <UNK> by the chef to the goofy <UNK> truly a good way to spend some time watching tv br br you could critique the show for having guests like marc <UNK> as a judge but <UNK> it's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize br br oh yeah and i'm bitter john <UNK> isn't the new iron chef br br ala <UNK>
<START> i checked this movie out when it still had 6 votes and it said like 7 2 or something but seriously this is a horrible movie lets break it down the first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a hand held digital camera owned by a <UNK> at a community college the next thing you'll notice is that the actors are all friends of said <UNK> he probably met them at the pub the night before third on the list you will notice that the musical editing is horrible and they try to <UNK> many songs into this movie at 30 second <UNK> also all digital editing is done on said <UNK> home pc probably using windows movie maker this movie was horrible pretentious had an undeniably bad script and acting that followed suit i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone i know but i do sentence the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for an eternity
<START> this is a great little film that's very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances all the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this it's very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre it's a comedy romance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus <UNK> russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved vincent <UNK> performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise the ending was very cute and it's unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is <UNK> and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially good this is <UNK> movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance this is a great little film that's very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one the direction is very good <UNK> <UNK> does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace the acting is wonderful nicole kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with ben chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing kidman rules ben chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with kidman the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end vincent <UNK> is fantastic as the main villain yes he was <UNK> but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him mathieu <UNK> is ok here but didn't have much to do rest of the cast are fine overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> a friend of mine was in the cast as a <UNK> agent a non speaking part as i recall he brought it over on dvd so i could see it it was interesting but very much felt like an amateur film a well made amateur film though really boring and poorly written it was probably fun to make and be involved in but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release maybe in <UNK> they'd enjoy it but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement br br if this film maker has made or makes any more films he really should try to have a really interesting story line and good actors i'm sure this was a great learning tool for them i wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film making
<START> it's only 2 episodes into a 5 part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen that's on tv silver screen or even in real life br br as a writer it's so good it's almost <UNK> as a viewer it's so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a <UNK> instead of monday to friday it's clear that all these <UNK> are actually <UNK> br br i'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century so for me at least it's mind changing go watch it
<START> like too many recent british films this one takes a great cast and gives them a flimsy cliched script to work with the performances save it from total disgrace and it has some charm but it certainly didn't make me laugh where are all the great british writers hiding
<START> i love the movie it brought me back to the best time of my life br br we need that time again now more than ever for me it was a time of freedom learning and finding myself i will always miss it there will never be another time like the 60's unfortunately
<START> for what it is this is a pretty good movie i like both <UNK> <UNK> full house <UNK> christine top gun they both give strong performances the love interest is ok but this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie i love <UNK> and i hated seeing them paint over the 14 <UNK> of hand <UNK> <UNK> with good old army <UNK> drab there is a small history lesson here in that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played a key role in wwii i don't know if the training was quite like this <UNK> the movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere with good riding action sequences i love looking at the <UNK> of the vote history one 18 year old man gave the movie a 10 true bike lover i guess i wouldn't give it a 10 but i did give it an 8 i do not <UNK> every movie with the same scale there are movies that were big budget with great actors that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big star wars episode i is my best example i loved the first three <UNK> movies but i thought episode i was weak in comparison so it gets a lower rating from me than this movie i expect more from george lucas
<START> i can see little girls enjoying this show but calling this a family show is ridiculous i'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years it's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school and others as the seasons go on all of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson in the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke as for the actors i didn't like them either bob <UNK> was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom <UNK> dave <UNK> is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid and he's horrid john <UNK> was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him the oldest girl dj on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever the middle girl stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister the youngest girl michelle showed what bad actresses the olsen twins were you can always tell when they are switching them off the plot lines to too many story lines were so <UNK> stupid it's cringe worthy this is a family show that tried to replace any good substance with <UNK> and love and though those are needed for a show about a family they <UNK> it way too much this will be remembered as my least favorite sit com from the 80's and 90's br br my rating terrible show <UNK> 30 mins
<START> every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa so sue me i admit it i like cheesy <UNK> movies i like excellent intelligent ones too but as with so many things variety is a good thing what would the christmas season be without the <UNK> cinematic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of santa in all his <UNK> from edmund <UNK> to billy bob <UNK> fred claus will make no one forget <UNK> falls but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed fred is a perfectly ok holiday movie with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids my wife and i laughed a lot even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince paul <UNK> was a top notch santa which helped a lot not a great flick and unlikely to become must viewing for anyone's <UNK> christmas traditions but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was holiday <UNK> with a small dash of spice there's nothing wrong with that
<START> i've just seen it for those who don't know what it is i suggest to <UNK> the entire feature and enjoy viewing it it's kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end but this time besides the black knight there is also superman it would be wonderful if they made the entire movie but i'm afraid that it's almost impossible especially just before the official batman 5 film br br there is no greater crime against peace than the <UNK> to fight for it br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this last dutch speaking film of <UNK> made me laugh good as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece <UNK> all the senses i haven't read gerard <UNK> book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a <UNK> picture of a somewhat self <UNK> poet writer who gets his in a way no spoiling here an anti hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he all this in a superbly <UNK> cinematography paul <UNK> manages to turn the otherwise rather cute <UNK> dutch locations into a suspenseful film noir setting impressive work
<START> the film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about 5 mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see i don't like this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually ran out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy better still don't go and see it at all
<START> sunny a cocktail waitress in the d c area is a bit dim to put in mildly she drives an old <UNK> and <UNK> a tiny room from a gay male couple however she saves the life of a prominent arab by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks <UNK> an opportunity presidential <UNK> get her <UNK> in the <UNK> department for the u s government even then she <UNK> things up at times but she tries hard and learns a lot she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official but is there another sinister plot in the making involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife a blonde one lol lol lol this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb as a fox as they say sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u s government very very well she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her <UNK> surroundings perhaps the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work but for those who like to laugh rent this today
<START> i have to be honest i was expecting a failure so bad because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money but that wasn't the case with this pretty funny sometimes odd movie i loved how they told the story of timon and <UNK> the story with <UNK> and him having trouble sleeping was funny the <UNK> bubble and when <UNK> leaves the <UNK> stop it's all harmless fun good for kids and some adults i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of <UNK> off toward the end it works 8 out of 10
<START> this movie is perfect for families to watch together it is a great film and it deserves more credit the special effects are stunning and spectacular everyone who has children should share this with theirs
<START> i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of a c grade porn movie with one major difference no porn br br the story and dialogue needs a complete <UNK> maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked up br br while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just pointless br br it was a complete waste of my time
<START> cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while <UNK> around cuba on a western <UNK> cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the <UNK> regime came and took the property of the boy's father the majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that <UNK> in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their <UNK> a good film worth watching several times <UNK>
<START> this is a great movie but there could be more about soylent green there should be more scenes of what they do to people how people act in <UNK> i think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year <UNK> and beyond even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie so go rent or buy this movie right now
<START> i can clearly see now why robin hood <UNK> quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood <UNK> some cow clad in make up at the beginning of the episode how many people wore <UNK> in the <UNK> century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down and is essentially a pile of <UNK> p a great hero of england has been <UNK> br br will you tolerate this i won't that's for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment 3 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self <UNK> the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours <UNK> with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the film's <UNK> at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story
<START> what starts out as <UNK> conflict in this movie ends in understanding <UNK> and grace the movie <UNK> through europe with the father and the young son <UNK> in a car over 3000 miles the <UNK> forces <UNK> beliefs and life skills to <UNK> there's really no clear winner it all adds up in the end as experience experience of multiple layers of life for those interested in understanding islam this movie offers a generous and gentle <UNK> without being <UNK> about the agenda it's a coming of age story for the young son his <UNK> and rebellious nature turning to <UNK> for receiving more ways of life
<START> an unusual take on time travel instead of traveling to <UNK> past the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet they <UNK> down to this planet whose sun is <UNK> to go <UNK> in 3 or 4 hours that's cutting it close in some kind of futuristic library they meet mr <UNK> a to z get it ha ha and his <UNK> it turns out instead of escaping their <UNK> destruction via space travel the usual way the inhabitants have all escaped into their <UNK> various past time <UNK> mr <UNK> uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection check out the <UNK> we see here another trek <UNK> of <UNK> and dvds when mr <UNK> <UNK> the machine the <UNK> what <UNK> <UNK> kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the <UNK> version of <UNK> <UNK> century where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for <UNK> there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill <UNK> in this time using <UNK> of the time you're a bully fine <UNK> witch witch they'll burn <UNK> spock mccoy follow kirk but end up in an ice age <UNK> years earlier br br kirk manages to get back to the library first the real story here is <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> of his <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> years ago this doesn't really make sense except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change even so spock mccoy weren't <UNK> by <UNK> oh well it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately he mentions being from <UNK> of light <UNK> away instead of the correct hundreds or thousands a gross error for a logical <UNK> in any case spock really shows his nasty side here forget day of the <UNK> and remember this side of paradise mccoy quickly finds out that his <UNK> buddy will not stand for any of his usual <UNK> and nearly gets his face <UNK> spock also gets it on with <UNK> a <UNK> female who had been <UNK> to this cold past as punishment a couple of trek novels were written about <UNK> son the result of this union all these scenes are eye <UNK> a reminder of just how much spock <UNK> or holds in it's also ironic that only a few episodes earlier <UNK> for <UNK> mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love and now all this happens kirk meanwhile <UNK> with the elderly <UNK> who insists that kirk head back to some past era you are evidently a <UNK> maniac great stuff from actor <UNK> last seen in bread and <UNK> it all works out in the end but like i mentioned earlier they cut it very close a neat little trek adventure with a definite <UNK> <UNK>
<START> in stand by me <UNK> and teddy discuss who was <UNK> superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like <UNK> and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts god br br black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are <UNK> in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes br br jet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so fun br br besides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a <UNK> yes lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film
<START> the lady from shanghai is weird even by the standards of its <UNK> director orson welles whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon it's a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky irish sailor played by welles who falls in with a mysterious lady rita hayworth who was married to welles at the time and her crippled and probably <UNK> husband played with a <UNK> <UNK> gusto by everett <UNK> a long sea voyage follows with welles in <UNK> as bodyguard and the plot <UNK> when <UNK> law partner glenn <UNK> turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown a murder plot ensues and all sorts of <UNK> follow for welles and his <UNK> and at this point the story fuzzy and told at a <UNK> pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not by itself possess and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess br br it's hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe <UNK> his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife but self destruction <UNK> as it often does with welles and miss hayworth has never looked less <UNK> that she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar as aside from her beauty her most appealing <UNK> as a screen personality was <UNK> a quality she does not possess in this picture the director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at o'hara the presumably <UNK> sailor since welles for all his many gifts was not known as an easy man to work with this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean connery or robert shaw might have been able to breath life into welles does not the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> loony <UNK> law partner <UNK> works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd sour notes and are often <UNK> edited but for all this he manages to make <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and disturbing and <UNK> in a <UNK> way the more flamboyant method actors of the fifties such as timothy carey br br there is a question that <UNK> me about this film what was welles trying to say he was a highly talented and intelligent man and tended to make statements in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth i think i have an answer or a partial one welles was <UNK> up his movie career he had reached the end of his rope in the hollywood studio system he <UNK> and he knew it the lady from shanghai isn't exactly a nose <UNK> at the studio <UNK> of the day but i suspect that it is in its portrait of amoral rival big shot lawyers read producers expressing welles' opinion of the power <UNK> of hollywood that he presented himself as a <UNK> sailor is telling welles himself was certainly an <UNK> <UNK> and he rarely lived in one place for long he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big <UNK> film citizen kane which caused a <UNK> of controversy from which he never fully <UNK> this may be the issue that <UNK> not speak its name in this film which is to say welles' personal failure in not getting over the shock of his <UNK> in the movie colony and his inability to deliver the goods as promised the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not <UNK> disasters well beyond his control that he presented himself in the movie as an <UNK> naive <UNK> shows a lack of self knowledge on welles' part he was much more of an inside player than he let on and i imagine that he <UNK> his knowledge of the <UNK> aspects of life and himself for knowing so much
<START> there are those movies that are bad they are funny then there are those where you scream i want that one and a half hours of my life back thats pretty much what this is br br dean cain tries to be an actor but fails the <UNK> are really bad repeated scenes and rocks that look like falling paper and the fake plastic guns that have <UNK> taped on them the split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just terrible br br this movie cant even be used as one of those simple night <UNK> its just that bad br br if i could go negative ratings i would
<START> i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick <UNK> and some of the other actors roy <UNK> for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind <UNK> mines the very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre school kid would've been spell bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day
<START> i am a shakespeare fan and i can appreciate what ken branagh has done to bring shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers however this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences add that with alicia <UNK> stumbling over the dialogue reminiscent of keanu reeves in much <UNK> about nothing and other poorly cast roles it all equals an excruciating <UNK> of viewing
<START> i watched this video at a friend's house i'm glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie <UNK> one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups most not related to <UNK> flight <UNK> smoking gun is a short video clip of the <UNK> preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the <UNK> film his claims about radiation <UNK> star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of <UNK> to <UNK> against <UNK> the <UNK> or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
<START> this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay <UNK> to the <UNK> of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
<START> the screaming skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it now there's a hook the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and <UNK> that turn up at <UNK> times add to the formula a <UNK> creepy <UNK> who still <UNK> the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane but then again when i first saw house on haunted hill as a nine year old it gave me the <UNK> <UNK> in the same way i'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era br br don't get me wrong the film is not terrible it just seems to get tedious at times but there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but <UNK> <UNK> home and the gardens and pool are a nice touch for me the best played out scene involves eric <UNK> john hudson going <UNK> in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just <UNK> right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged <UNK> director alex <UNK> in a <UNK> role it makes you wonder who the real <UNK> was br br in it's own good way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat <UNK> the <UNK> make their first appearance in <UNK> wing doors in 1958 that at least made me jump out of my seat
<START> wow simply awful i was a fan of the original movie and <UNK> sat through part 2 3 was and improvement 4 5 and freddy's dead were pretty bad but nothing is as bad as freddy's nightmares freddy acts as a rod <UNK> host of this anthology series br br i can accept how freddy became one punchline after another but at least in the movies the appeal of freddy carried the movies but here these were so poorly made they looked like high school productions of a horror series the poor actors if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for i'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors ones just starting on the hollywood ladder brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week or seasoned actors on their way down the hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week br br i half expected dana <UNK> to guest star but she was already dead by the time this was in production br br to <UNK> <UNK> line in the original elm st what ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this
<START> eleven different film makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the <UNK> attack this is one of the best effort you will see in any film films like this are rarely made and appreciated this film tries to touch every possible core of <UNK> here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique br br there is the story from <UNK> <UNK> iran where somewhere in iran people are preparing for the attacks from america there a teacher is trying to <UNK> her students by <UNK> them about innocent people being killed in <UNK> massacre then comes a story from <UNK> <UNK> egypt where a film maker comes across face to face conversation with a dead soldier in the <UNK> attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in <UNK> attack then we see a story from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where a group of five innocent children's sees <UNK> bin laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from america then we see the story from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mexico where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real footage of <UNK> buildings coming down and the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives the other most important story is from mira <UNK> india where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son whose name is <UNK> trapped in <UNK> massacre after september 11 attack our heart beat automatically starts <UNK> if we hear two names anywhere in the world first is world trade centre and the second is <UNK> this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it br br i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of home dvd collection definitely worth every penny you spend but please don't expect anything more apart from films in this dvd there is of course <UNK> of the film makers but no extra features
<START> death lends a hand is one of the pivotal early episodes of columbo that helped define the show for the next thirty years it marks the first of robert <UNK> four appearances three as a murderer playing much the same role in each show br br in this case <UNK> plays <UNK> the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper <UNK> mr <UNK> is having an affair although she is <UNK> decides not to tell <UNK> in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husband's business associates she <UNK> badly to this suggestion an argument ensues which rapidly turns violent as <UNK> <UNK> her across the face because he is wearing a large ring the blow knocks her to the ground and kills her br br there are some really priceless moments in this episode one of my favourite scenes is where columbo pretends to be into palm reading although this is in fact a <UNK> to discover the shape and size of <UNK> ring without <UNK> that he knows the killer wore a ring columbo being columbo he only reveals what he really knows when the time is exactly right to turn the <UNK> a little so initially he <UNK> plays the part of a rather simple minded man who gets excited by the <UNK> going over the <UNK> of the moon or some equally ridiculous palm reading <UNK> <UNK> br br another great scene is when <UNK> tries to offer columbo a job for his firm effectively <UNK> him to stop <UNK> his nose around again columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on he pretends to be <UNK> and excited by this job offer br br and there's another where columbo says to <UNK> in front of <UNK> that he wishes the murderer could hear their conversation he wants to hint to <UNK> that he is onto him without directly <UNK> him so he rather <UNK> but understandable in the circumstances decides to play <UNK> on <UNK> in order to <UNK> him into <UNK> and doing something stupid which of course he does all the while the <UNK> <UNK> is unaware of the subtext of this conversation it's only near the end that columbo explains all to <UNK> not shown on screen br br i won't reveal how columbo finally nails the killer bang to rights but let's just say there's a <UNK> involved br br a really really good episode possibly the very best of the first series if you liked this then you'll like double exposure too also featuring robert <UNK>
<START> this movie is wonderful the writing directing acting all are fantastic very witty and clever script quality performances by actors ally <UNK> is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky really original and heart <UNK> <UNK> the scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production
<START> the critics are dumb this movie is funny and smart i loved this movie a lot why does everyone hate this movie so much i wish people would love this movie more than they don't ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie i don't see you people out there making movies like them so people should just watch it and not comment it i like this movie it is ok through it all there are parts were it <UNK> dumb but at least they made it jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens but this is better than that i can't believe this was rated so low
<START> one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began the members of the summer of love culture at the end of the seventies and <UNK> of the 80's were eventually tool old for love <UNK> and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life whatever that meant for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational <UNK> <UNK> was the culture of wonderland a love for drugs and a sense of <UNK> coupled with a <UNK> for authority values and the establishment is the world that the film captures br br the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that <UNK> the american house apart once the battles were over we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the <UNK> of the seventies part biker part hippie part crook all <UNK> no ideology to express just a sense of <UNK> with everything and <UNK> to nothing ron billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin <UNK> with <UNK> they talk of love and behave violently they take from the rich and sell to the <UNK> they steal from everyone br br holmes and company are the end result of a strange <UNK> of anti matter like sex and drugs and rock roll when the lab <UNK> get bored and move on br br the film is <UNK> directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug <UNK> in their element the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant that story was told in boogie nights this is a story of a <UNK> and forgettable era
<START> eh not a particular good slasher flick so so acting effects decent yet familiar and <UNK> soundtrack br br there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes apart from that there's a lot of characters wandering around not realizing what's going on or chasing after red herrings more killing of time than of people there are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer not partial to any one <UNK> the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well the identity isn't revealed towards the end and motive is pretty thin and we really don't care br br supposedly the movie takes place around christmas but this isn't a major factor one scene gets lit by christmas lights that's about it br br the movie is rather dark with a <UNK> picture most of the time at least on the <UNK> i watched some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes the ending should have been stronger than it was we think we realize what happened although there's a chance something else did
<START> <UNK> this one was a stinker it does not fall <UNK> in between star wars and <UNK> thats for sure in all <UNK> it falls somewhere between the cracks of a <UNK> video and captain <UNK> only with not as big of a budget and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying simon le bon <UNK> front and center while the rest of the band <UNK> tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from <UNK> <UNK> last 3 albums brief clips from <UNK> add nothing avoid at all costs however i liked the part when they played <UNK> like the <UNK> but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger <UNK> i mean they aren't singing <UNK> of the <UNK> or <UNK> like the <UNK> it's a wolf whatever a dvd of <UNK> <UNK> '80s videos is probably worth a look for <UNK> sake
<START> when i saw this movie i couldn't believe my eyes where these hilarious creatures <UNK> muppets with big <UNK> teeth really meant to be scary or where they designed to have a good laugh i sincerely hope so if you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them better dragging them across the screen the whole was rather funny than scary and i had a good time watching the movie because i was amazed by its overall <UNK> to have only one good part it is one big joke from beginning to end and i believe this movie belongs into a new category so unbelievable crappy you'll be laughing from beginning to end i'm not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things
<START> don't get me wrong the movie is beautiful the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic however it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done br br <UNK> planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph loss and gain it was balanced br br disney's edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to <UNK> us they made <UNK> evil they made <UNK> evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive br br i am all for <UNK> global warning but this was over the top political and <UNK> junk br br that's another thing i went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at home br br if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the <UNK> planet earth series it is better lessons better sound and if you have <UNK> ray better picture quality
<START> i took a <UNK> in renting this movie but i gotta say it was very very good on all <UNK> script cast director photography and high production values etc proves eva longoria parker is head and shoulders in <UNK> com above bad actors such as kate hudson and jennifer aniston who <UNK> and call it acting <UNK> <UNK> it br br parker and <UNK> fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as over her dead body lake bell is excellent too and this is the first time i have seen her and finally paul rudd gets to shine in a really good movie instead of lesser films br br a movie like this never gets its <UNK> from close minded males it's too bad as other imdb reviewers here have noted there is nothing lame about this gem no hack writing or acting br br and its depiction of contemporary l a and california in general makes every scene look bright beautiful clean and otherwise outstanding in every way never before has a movie made l a look so good ah what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie br br i won't <UNK> the plot but as a long time and hard core <UNK> i was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light hearted piece of entertainment it reminds me very much of the old <UNK> movies which were also so enjoyable br br this movie exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ghost for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap <UNK> they are we already know the public taste <UNK> heavily toward the mediocre some of us save our praise for the truly worthy however br br if you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as into the night with michelle pfeiffer jeff goldblum and <UNK> <UNK> blind date with bruce willis and kim basinger american <UNK> with <UNK> williams chances are with robert downey jr christopher <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> making mr right with john <UNK> etc you'll enjoy this br br a first rate job all around even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years but even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie's overall excellence
<START> what's happening to <UNK> he seems to repeat himself in every movie has he run out of creative ideas if he has time to take a back seat went to see the movie with great anticipation of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original i knew it wouldn't the <UNK> said it all but even then i thought it would be a great <UNK> treat after all isn't he the same guy who directed <UNK> and company or is he i have my doubts after watching <UNK> i am not going to talk about the plot or the story as most of it is taken from the original if you are really dying to go and see this one you could play a fun game with friends identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own so <UNK> becomes <UNK> how corny is that guess <UNK> wouldn't sound that great ajay <UNK> is quite a disaster as <UNK> the comedy is strained and the <UNK> talk that really was effective in company sounds fake the chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't exists at all in fact the more charming <UNK> tries to be the more irritating she becomes this reaches a peak by the end raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others he is a guy to watch in the future i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as <UNK> he looks like a caricature of <UNK> <UNK> there is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a <UNK> instead of inspiring fear he looks like a <UNK> with his bowl the only performance that really stood out was <UNK> <UNK> as inspector <UNK> i am afraid i don't have the patience to write more
<START> i was interested in seeing this movie because i knew it was christian based the director had a good idea intentions when making this movie but it could have been better i can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life however i didn't understand why the director made his friends so <UNK> mean and rude the main character kept <UNK> to his friends when they were the ones mean to him they weren't understanding at all and they used god as a reason to explain their <UNK> the main character nor anyone else didn't know if the ex girlfriend was divorced still married etc but they were against him <UNK> old feelings that needed to be dealt with his friends were suppose to be christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not so many times we do things in life where we don't apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him the ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name address and phone number she seemed to be the stalker she didn't seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself god is love and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god doesn't care about true love only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with we all make mistakes it's all about what steps you take to make <UNK> like i said the movie had potential but i was tired of the one sided point of view being constantly repeated and <UNK> down the viewers throat by his so called well meaning friends this movie didn't hold true to the christian belief of love but i give it a c for its effort
<START> ronald colman won a best actor oscar for <UNK> performance as a popular stage <UNK> who completely loses himself in his roles particularly as shakespeare's othello <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> film has a marvelous <UNK> having been written by the <UNK> team of ruth gordon and <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately the witty banter comes off as self conscious here and the <UNK> business is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also won an oscar for his score and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress when theatrical colman <UNK> <UNK> her she asks him what are ya some kind of nut otherwise this scenario is awfully obvious surprisingly <UNK> and not very funny 1 2 from
<START> the story centers around barry <UNK> who must go to england if he wishes to claim his inheritance being about the <UNK> aussie <UNK> ever to set foot outside this great nation of <UNK> there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue the songs of barry <UNK> barry <UNK> are highlights
<START> yes <UNK> is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity here we have <UNK> as a <UNK> genie yes a <UNK> genie where he does everything from making bad <UNK> to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him so yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and <UNK> not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid what might not be expected is that a film with a kid and <UNK> o'neill would be so incredibly <UNK> the main plot of the film involves this kid played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great <UNK> of frank <UNK> where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog <UNK> who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom box then <UNK> ensues as the kid makes the <UNK> genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make <UNK> with his shady gang type <UNK> father br br this really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been <UNK> in a million other movies i e the two chances in life speech from father to son but it's <UNK> o'neill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking <UNK> of it all his plot line involves him when not getting the over talky treatment from <UNK> to rap within the dialog and also start off his <UNK> recording career on top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box so is there a camp factor to the movie up to a point but this is even <UNK> by all of the <UNK> scenes and <UNK> <UNK> moments that have really no business with the rest of the material one might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the <UNK> of the popularity of a basketball player who wanted to go on the michael jordan acting <UNK> if it would be anywhere near <UNK> entertaining or convincing i'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid but i'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty <UNK> for feeding the <UNK> machine br br so if you want to have a fun night of <UNK> as genie turned <UNK> turned <UNK> all the more fun to you hell it might even be interesting to have a <UNK> movie night with this and his other <UNK> acclaimed effort steel but if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's
<START> i was watching this with one of my friends who is a vampire freak and i was extremely disgusted at the fact that this film exists this film should be shown to prisoners of war yes it's that bad even john <UNK> wouldn't be able to sit through this so why the 3 10 rating because it had a vampire midget come on what's more entertaining than a vampire midget there's one scene in this film where john savage gets laid by saying i want to feel human again and the chick being the brainless stripper slut she is lets him feel human i wish i could feel human with jessica alba or <UNK> fox this is a movie for <UNK> there is bright flashy objects and random movements all in all don't waste your money on this garbage i got it for free when i was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a garbage barrel full of video tapes and a sign that said free so in a way i didn't get ripped off but still
<START> what happens when you give a homeless man 100 000 as if by asking that question they are somehow morally <UNK> of what is eventually going to happen the creators of <UNK> of fortune try to get their <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment br br they take ted a homeless man in <UNK> and give him 100 000 to see if he will turn his life around then with only the most <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they let him go on his merry way br br what are they trying to say money can't buy you happiness the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be or how about lift a man up it's more fun to watch him fall from a greater <UNK> they took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain that's supposed to be entertainment they dress this <UNK> up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos only this time they <UNK> the car crashes and asked what happens when you take down a stop sign
<START> it's a gentle easy going 1950s comedy kim novak belongs to a <UNK> of witches in manhattan she puts a spell on neighbor jimmy stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him losing her powers see witches are <UNK> to have hot blood but not love elsa <UNK> is <UNK> aunt also a witch jack lemmon is her brother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the chief witch and ernie <UNK> is sidney <UNK> an author who <UNK> in writing about witches br br i described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else everything is so smooth and polished from the set decoration through wardrobe and plot to the performances and direction take the character of ernie <UNK> he's referred to as a drunk and a nut and here's how the movie demonstrates these traits he asks for a second drink and though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen his hair is a bit long and <UNK> that's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut nothing is out of place everything is <UNK> and free of dust the soles of jimmy stewart's shoes are barely <UNK> br br and the zodiac club where the witches hang out it's called a low dive yet it's a clean dark place with polite <UNK> a <UNK> of musicians neatly dressed <UNK> and <UNK> plants against bare brick walls that is not my idea or yours of a low dive not even for <UNK> village in 1958 my idea of a dive in <UNK> village is <UNK> or the white horse <UNK> or the san <UNK> or the swing <UNK> a now <UNK> lesbian <UNK> the zodiac club is a high dive compared to these br br the <UNK> we always hear about is muted by today's standards i mean kim novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet and she wears a lot of black clothes like the <UNK> of the period did br br but never mind all that it's an enjoyable romantic comedy kim novak is effective as gillian who runs a primitive art shop for the <UNK> she has a strange beauty <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time she <UNK> rather than walks a <UNK> presence her <UNK> seem drawn with a set of plastic french <UNK> and jimmy stewart is quite good as the <UNK> and <UNK> victim in the 1930s he usually played in light roles in the <UNK> years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use who could resist laughing when <UNK> <UNK> forces him to wear a <UNK> and drink a hideous <UNK> of <UNK> fluid in order to cure him of <UNK> spell it's good to see him as a <UNK> instead of the angry and <UNK> man of principle he was in danger of becoming richard <UNK> directs the movie quietly without fireworks or special effects and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had note the scene in which novak casts the spell over stewart when the <UNK> <UNK> face and ears seem to <UNK> with <UNK> startling eyes br br ernie <UNK> in the 1950s was a well known television personality there was never anything quite like the ernie <UNK> show before or after it brings the word <UNK> to mind he could stage five minutes worth of <UNK> and <UNK> tricks in an <UNK> room with only <UNK> <UNK> for orchestra as background and he did an <UNK> sketch using the character of <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> poet the credits kind of skip over the <UNK> brothers but that's rather casual because these two guys pete and <UNK> were <UNK> <UNK> with independent careers in jazz <UNK> <UNK> was later a member of doc <UNK> band on johnny <UNK> late show br br the third act kind of <UNK> down a little and becomes more romantic than comedy but it's never dull the whole film rolls along as neatly as van <UNK> play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too
<START> i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a <UNK> special i think where are they now and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky <UNK> he played the male child ghost in this b horror horrible but i remember him from his character freddy on the silver <UNK> television show this <UNK> a major letdown there's nothing here it actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish i kept stopping it in boredom setting it aside and forgetting about it then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it obviously the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element the <UNK> and obviously here that doesn't work i can't stand the male leads i kept expecting them to look down at their <UNK> during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines the situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping <UNK> is awkward and plain dumb i guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh it's fairly good gore makeup there man i'm really reaching for a positive now huh the only other no budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be home sweet home
<START> i actually really like what i've seen of this cartoon so far sure the animation isn't the best but frankly i'd rather see this type of more <UNK> style done quickly and cheaply than the old type of style done quickly and cheaply which was starting to happen more and more often it's only a style that looks good when a lot of time and effort is put into it there's nothing wrong with the <UNK> lines and the little black <UNK> eyes in fact i think it's really cute as a kid i never thought scooby <UNK> design was particularly adorable but i think i might like it better know br br anyway shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not but i think he has the most potential for some depth sure the show doesn't center around the original mystery solving theme but that was just a tired old formula anyway don't get me wrong i'm sure there are writers out there who would be able to bring a lot more interest to mystery inc 's traditional <UNK> which has been lacking as late but in the mean time this show is a fun <UNK> from the standard shaggy and scooby are still funny but no longer only comic relief they're still cowardly but finally have the opportunity to use what seems to be shock intelligence they're the same old over eating <UNK> as ever but now actually seem to be getting on with their lives with the help of uncle <UNK> inheritance br br i used to find most original scooby doo jokes to be pure cheese and unintentionally hilarious at best but this show actually <UNK> a capacity for real humor also i never really like <UNK> <UNK> as shaggy anyway so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does other people i still think billy west was the best though br br overall while not a great cartoon in the scope of all of cartoon history still an achievement among other scooby <UNK>
<START> the movie titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember it re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten why so <UNK> i have no idea could will they ever make a movie like titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece it will be almost impossible br br the director no doubt had the major impact on the film a simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance yes i'm not the romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this guaranteed everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting br br the movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling everything looks very real and live the legend herself titanic is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too <UNK> the acting was the real effect <UNK> and <UNK> are simply the best at playing there roles no one could have done better they are partly the reason why the film is so great br br i guess it's not too much to talk about the plot is simple the acting is brilliant based on a true story probably more then half of the <UNK> that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something <UNK> and a film to <UNK> for hollywood could it get better no not at all the most moving film of all time don't listen to people see for yourself then you will understand a landmark don't be surprised if you cry too
<START> what can be said of the compelling performance of tara fitzgerald she is utterly believable as the injured mrs graham hardened by experience sharp and strong <UNK> yet not <UNK> to the passionate <UNK> of mr <UNK> through every mischievous glance and every <UNK> of temper every <UNK> of <UNK> in his eyes and telling facial expression toby <UNK> is a master of his character he is the force of passion and hope that will <UNK> <UNK> injured spirit <UNK> <UNK> is a perfect performance of the <UNK> rogue yet despite all he has done there is an <UNK> human dignity in his <UNK> to play the <UNK> at the end he is at least aware of his own <UNK> and how they have brought his ruin <UNK> attempt to save his soul after leaving him and taking their child at a time when this was <UNK> of is a triumph of hope hope and faith in the worth of every human life and soul however misguided however <UNK> that person may be <UNK> <UNK> may then be seen as her reward for her faith and <UNK> moral character though the <UNK> ideas of morality so strongly presented in tenant seem outdated by today's standards the story is <UNK> with integrity passion and conviction which still make an impact tenant is far more believable than <UNK> heights or even jane eyre here is an adaptation that does the novel justice i highly recommend viewing it
<START> pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong br br examples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern <UNK> that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the <UNK> you can never definitely predict a <UNK> location at a specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid <UNK> can pass through <UNK> all of this so far is accurate but then they <UNK> that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall you could indeed do it this is complete <UNK> instead the theory <UNK> that at our level it is possible for you to walk through a wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the <UNK> chance of passing through the wall the odds are so <UNK> against it br br this is but one example of how they <UNK> the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by <UNK> <UNK> about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with it br br plus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck i suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for <UNK> on <UNK> that gives you a history of physics from <UNK> and gravity to ed <UNK> and m theory in only 3 hour long episodes quantum <UNK> is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot who is going to <UNK> everyone acting is below average but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely <UNK> by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material all in all if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project this is a film to watch i guess that would be enough to say on this film everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough
<START> i'm one of the millions of columbo <UNK> all over the world and just watched this the episode that started it all on british channel 5 it is fascinating to think what <UNK> from this so so movie and i can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of columbo and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous classic series that said this particular movie is not as good as the rest except for the embarrassing final episode the <UNK> british episode if columbo had been made as per the original <UNK> it certainly would not have gone on for very long or be watched and loved world wide in this film lt columbo is <UNK> dressed drives a normal car has a partner doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive there's also none of the cat and mouse chemistry between columbo and the villain watchable but only for the novelty of seeing how columbo started out
<START> since starting to read the book this movie is based on i'm having mixed feelings about the filmed result i learned some time ago to see the movie adaptation of a book before i read the book because i found that if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film this would undoubtedly have been true here whereas in the case of <UNK> which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i've ever seen it would probably not have <UNK> br br i'm trying to figure out what the cause is and i suspect that i have to point my finger <UNK> at michael cunningham much as i respect him for the hours which i have not read but which i saw and was <UNK> by i cannot escape the feeling that he not so much adapted susan <UNK> book as he did take a few of the characters and the basic premise and write his own movie out of it br br it's not that i dislike the movie i actually love the movie which is why since i started reading the novel i'm feeling disturbed about the whole thing i feel <UNK> to ms <UNK> for enjoying the movie which was so <UNK> a departure from her work reading it i can understand why she had such a struggle adapting it unlike what one reviewer of the movie said it's not so much that some novels don't deserve to be a movie it's more like some books just can't make the transition ms <UNK> novel <UNK> on a level so personal and intimate to her central character so <UNK> that it seems impossible to me to place it in a physical realm even though a lot of the book is memory of real events it is memory and so <UNK> and <UNK> as to be i feel not <UNK> i think that ms <UNK> work is a real work of literature but cannot make the transition to film which in no way <UNK> from its value br br i cannot yet report that evening the film does not represent evening the novel in any more than the most superficial way since i'm only halfway through but the original would have to make a tremendous leap to resemble the film that follows at this point i guess i'm writing this because i feel that if you're going to adapt a novel adapt it but don't make it something else that it's not i'm not sure if michael cunningham has done anything wholly original but from what i can see so far the things he has done are all based on someone else's work we would not have the hours if virginia <UNK> had not written mrs <UNK> and we would not have evening in its <UNK> form if susan <UNK> had not had so much trouble doing what probably should not have been attempted in the first place but it's too much to say that it would be better if ms <UNK> had left well enough alone because evening the film is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own br br thus my confusion mixed feelings sense of <UNK> and ultimate conclusion that in this case the novel cannot be the film and vice versa and my eventual <UNK> to both writers for doing what they did so that we have both works as they are
<START> jack frost is really a cool movie i mean its funny its violent and very enjoyable most people say that it is b rated but that couldn't be <UNK> from the truth it has great special effects and good acting the only weird thing is of course the killer snowman i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late nineties most films these days lack the <UNK> of a clive barker master piece that is be original and give the viewer what they do not expect jack frost is very cool 10 out of 10 grade a ed also <UNK> the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost
<START> in spite of having some exciting and daring sequences <UNK> just never gets going there are exploding <UNK> hat pin murders mass <UNK> <UNK> with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes but they're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition everybody in the movie looks bored this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed br br add to this the too proper brit characters and you feel like you've <UNK> into a sherlock holmes movie br br finally the cinematography is very ordinary there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge <UNK> but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull br br definitely only for lee and cushing fans
<START> spoilers br br tom and jerry is a classic cartoon with a flawless idea and almost every single short is a gem while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts there is not way you can hate this cartoon sure it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes and i can say that i agree but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great but some are just better than others well this would fit into others br br here is the plot of <UNK> cat tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast and becomes easily frightened jerry <UNK> how scared he is and tries to scare him even more than he already is he creates scary <UNK> for tom and tom becomes scared out of his wits and his lives jerry then puts a sheet over a <UNK> <UNK> and controls it thus making it look like the <UNK> is a ghost tom finds out that jerry did all of this and chases him tom then accidentally bites the house maid however at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a <UNK> cup br br overall this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short but it felt like something was missing in this it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts anyway this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons but it is still nice br br 7 10
<START> it was a saturday night and a movie called baseketball was on tv i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema boy was i mistaken words cannot describe how funny this film is starring the creators of south park who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny i taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time i have seen it 7 times im obsessed with it and i know anyone who <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> work will appreciate this movie a must see this is my 1 comedy of all time
<START> primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it br br a bunch of terrorists high jack a <UNK> and kill an entire army doing so they believe it to hold <UNK> but no it contains two <UNK> with a taste for human flesh then a crack team who might as well be called <UNK> force get called in br br ok this ain't jurassic park and yes the <UNK> are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a costume that's not too <UNK> to barney the dinosaur only slightly less terrifying but come on guys this had about 1 of jurassic <UNK> budget and as such does what it can br br does this deserve to be in the bottom 100 hell no i think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 are being way way overly harsh it's much closer to a 4 it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom 100 and has a similar production value to a sci fi channel production again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb br br the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously neither does the script br br all in all it's an enjoyable b movie not for film <UNK> br br out of
<START> the violent and rebel twenty five years old sailor antwone fisher derek luke is sent to three sessions for <UNK> with the navy psychiatrist dr <UNK> <UNK> denzel washington after another <UNK> and <UNK> against a superior <UNK> navy man reluctant in the beginning of the treatment he gets confidence in dr <UNK> and <UNK> his childhood revealing painful <UNK> generated in his foster house meanwhile he meets <UNK> <UNK> joy <UNK> and they fall in love for each other <UNK> his personal problems antwone becomes a new man this true <UNK> drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life the direction of denzel washington is excellent making sensitive attractive and with good taste a story about child abuse in the hands of another director it might be a very heavy story my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK>
<START> i'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin my <UNK> is split 30 tone <UNK> 70 lackluster writing br br the 30 i agree with the first <UNK> synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully <UNK> the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it's inhabited only by the cast of <UNK> girl this is coming from someone who likes <UNK> girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by <UNK> while we can see the <UNK> under the film so clearly <UNK> to be diverse but falling ever so short br br the 70 is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token <UNK> are one dimensional cardboard <UNK> of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each <UNK> in the film the audience is treated to what i'd say is a gag we get a basic <UNK> then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprise the stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence <UNK> solely on the <UNK> of the ending you're writing jokes br br spoilers below br br the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories that's fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voice over but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another br br meaning there is no seduction in the broad sense no tension and neither confrontation nor <UNK> between the <UNK> of two different people trying to <UNK> their existence to <UNK> the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets <UNK> by the girl he's hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we'd be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a <UNK> could unfold with all the other tales as well a then b that's it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the <UNK> island sketch the only queens is the <UNK> of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village br br it's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual <UNK> and so on new york i love you however deserves to be held to <UNK> <UNK> because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new <UNK> but instead we have <UNK> before us the selected slice of a <UNK> its characters <UNK> in from the o c plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole <UNK> becomes an <UNK> to the very notion of diversity and the <UNK> and cultures the movie <UNK> fails to represent br br for example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her <UNK> male <UNK> when in fact he's the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend <UNK> are <UNK> the girl away it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl's father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually <UNK> dancer what the dad can't be just some guy from south america now that he's obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle to upper class white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too <UNK> br br it's not my place to <UNK> where the movie should have gone but in every <UNK> set up and plot twist the direction taken screams status <UNK> appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the single <UNK> of the characters <UNK> them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in <UNK> being <UNK> at by a <UNK> old white guy how <UNK> an asian <UNK> pursuing a white college kid instead again i'm not saying the entire <UNK> has to be changed it's just that every damn story premise is so hackneyed and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading br br i will <UNK> the <UNK> of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was well <UNK> and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldn't <UNK> anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non <UNK> is when the old opera singer says <UNK> that's what i love about new york everyone's from a different place well you wouldn't know it from watching this one
<START> i absolutely love this show but i saw the second episode first after watching the first episode i could see why people were turned off at first the first <UNK> humor is not the best and they struggle to properly start the series however i still like the light and humorous attitude of the show the characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters as a first episode it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good the episode is not bad by any means but as the show progresses it becomes better and better so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show
<START> a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the <UNK> and later their bodies are stolen en route to the <UNK> newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings she discovers that right before each ceremony the bride was given a rare <UNK> supposedly from the <UNK> which contained a powerful drug that <UNK> them patricia is told that the <UNK> was first grown by a dr <UNK> who lives in a secluded estate with his wife in reality dr <UNK> is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their <UNK> fluid to keep his wife <UNK> young patricia along with dr foster who is working with dr <UNK> on the medical mystery surrounding his wife try to force dr <UNK> hand by setting up a phony wedding which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor's <UNK> this movie had a very good opening reel but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes the cast is decent <UNK> and coffin deserved better but that's life russell steals the show even out <UNK> lugosi who does not give one of his more memorable performances even considering his <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today's hollywood <UNK> <UNK> weak and contrived ending as well rating based on b movies 4
<START> why is it that any film about <UNK> the last <UNK> brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over <UNK> high school <UNK> despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of the 50's admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel sex br br miss <UNK> has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it didn't wash off on the others
<START> i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in <UNK> kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry <UNK> getting <UNK> on the football field the whole audience was in <UNK> with laughter laughter that lasted until the credits br br for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry <UNK> as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head but br br if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
<START> this is really a very bad movie why first of all the story is bad it is an artificial story combining all sorts of things together that make no sense it just seems a wrong experiment secondly the actors cannot play in a realistic manner they cannot even talk as an actor should why did i buy this movie and what must i do with it now
<START> so neighbor was killing neighbor reminds me of iraq as i watched the american flag 50 stars in <UNK> being dragged behind the horse i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction indifference to the bill of rights i'm a <UNK> and must have some historical memory br br watching the <UNK> <UNK> character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave as he looks at the <UNK> of blacks and germans his ethnic background being <UNK> at a poker game was interesting many twists in this movie the wife who is forced into her marriage shows both lust and a strong will characteristics we're not used to seeing in <UNK> victorian southern <UNK> br br the crazy <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> gave me some insight into why my cousin head of the <UNK> horse <UNK> gang inc in <UNK> was hung about that time bands of homeless men were <UNK> the countryside armed remind you of iraq and how similar we are underneath the <UNK> of religion and ethnic background and why <UNK> are still fighting that civil war today br br too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just <UNK> and are <UNK> <UNK> civil war everywhere that's <UNK> now called iraq who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil the wild eyed killers in <UNK> <UNK> lawrence kansas could as easily be the <UNK> we're fighting now with no success br br another <UNK> was the father's tribute to the <UNK> who move into lawrence and <UNK> a school even before they <UNK> a church and for that reason they'll win huh i was taught history in <UNK> al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and <UNK> that's why they won course they also literally had god on their side as you see here when the freed slave <UNK> that he's cutting out to free his mother sold into slavery in texas god what a horrible legacy slavery gave us br br acting pretty good lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride <UNK> into battle but didn't hear any rebel yells so reminiscent of football games in <UNK> you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was as the <UNK> and <UNK> gather their forces for another raid they have lost sight of why they're fighting and so do we just more mindless slaughter br br you're also brought up to date with the <UNK> kids coming home from iraq as the <UNK> <UNK> what <UNK> first has his arm <UNK> shut trying to save it then has it <UNK> and then dies so much suffering for such a stupid cause br br the cinematography is fantastic now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes one of my favorite parts of any movie i suspect that this movie was written by a gore <UNK> as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era if you knew history the dialogue is definitely thought provoking not your ordinary blood and guts war movie by any means you see the wounded but still active duty soldiers still fighting cause they have nothing else to do you see the southern <UNK> living off the land stealing <UNK> yet at the beginning you've seen the battle stop so the women could be <UNK> from danger as i read the <UNK> number of women and children dying in iraq i'm thinking where did we lose our sense of honor as a people i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years but some book somewhere <UNK> it with good reason <UNK> at his best pre <UNK> buy the dvd or rent it and tell me why others <UNK> this not just <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the <UNK> heat i could not have been more pleased the road to <UNK> directed by sam <UNK> american beauty is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time perhaps i'm just getting old perhaps i've just seen the same themes recycled time and again but this movie is indeed different br br the story opens with young michael sullivan jr facing out to the sea <UNK> the <UNK> of his father's legacy one of the best men to ever live one of the most evil this <UNK> snakes its way throughout the movie the story revolves around crime boss john rooney paul newman and michael sullivan tom hanks the young man rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal angel of death rooney is tied by blood to his own son but tied by love and loyalty to michael young michael jr intrigued by the stories he reads steals away in his father's car one night while dad goes off to work with connor rooney heir to the family business connor lets the situation get out of hand and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder witnessed by michael jr upon the discovery that young michael has seen what he should not have seen the plot is set in motion as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> soon michael sr is on the run with his young son pursued by contract killer <UNK> the reporter maguire jude law br br i will <UNK> no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers however i strongly encourage viewers to examine the many <UNK> that present themselves in the movie problems between sons and fathers michael sr jr john rooney son connor between the world at home and the world at work between good and evil between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are between clean money and dirty between the town of <UNK> and <UNK> as hell and along the way <UNK> the visual brilliance of cinematographer conrad l hall 9 nominations 2 oscars for best cinematography rain <UNK> off <UNK> shots through mirrors especially on swinging doors tommy gun flashes from out of the shadows absent any sound not only has 75 year old hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career but <UNK> year old paul newman offers one of his best performances ever br br yes i may be getting old but i've seen a lot and this is fresh and <UNK> the road to <UNK> presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre to films of the 40s to dark comic book figures lurking in the darkness to villains and heroes to american film in general go see it
<START> the tv guide described the plot of severed ties as thus an experiment on a severed arm goes awry so right away i thought this was going to be about an arm that s got a mind of its own as seen in the beast with five fingers or the hand or someone getting an arm transplant as in body parts both premises are tried and tested or to be more accurate tired and tested so i was curious as to how the producers would approach the story i actually thought they were making an <UNK> movie like <UNK> down to the use of b w photography at the start of the film but the makers seemed to have tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a splatter comedy similar to the evil dead i <UNK> very little to say on this except that i disliked the evil dead movies and i disliked severed ties and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for <UNK>
<START> dana andrews stands where the sidewalk ends in this 1950 film that also stars gene tierney gary <UNK> karl malden and <UNK> brand andrews plays new york city detective sgt mark dixon a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects when a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster <UNK> <UNK> dixon and his partner go to investigate <UNK> blames the murder on ken <UNK> stevens who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife morgan tierney but the victim dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the <UNK> men he goes to see <UNK> and not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him now he must cover up the murder as a further <UNK> he falls for morgan her father ken <UNK> who went to <UNK> apartment after he saw that <UNK> had hit his daughter is arrested for the crime br br this is a really terrific gritty noir with some good performances the <UNK> handsome and <UNK> andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues the movie <UNK> him with his fabulous laura <UNK> gene tierney and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being <UNK> up little does she know she's got another one on her hands ken <UNK> does a terrific job as her father who <UNK> his innocence despite some <UNK> evidence karl malden is very tough as <UNK> boss br br my only problem with this well directed fast moving and absorbing film is the ending pure hollywood and putting myself in <UNK> place i doubt i would react the same way a minor criticism for a film written by ben <UNK> and directed by otto preminger i didn't find it as awe inspiring as laura but few things in this world are if you like film noir this is a must see
<START> this tv made thriller is all talk little action it works hard to set up its convoluted plot yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still <UNK> at best by the end i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning it has a quasi ten little indians scenario but <UNK> it mid way through in favor of <UNK> sally field and her <UNK> of a killer field overacts here with a <UNK> i've seldom seen from her the early <UNK> are good but the writing quickly <UNK> off course and eventually goes over the top lots of <UNK> and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing a curious failure from producers aaron spelling leonard goldberg with all this talent couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet
<START> another comedy about a <UNK> little country struggling through the jungle of the modern for the forties global world with only native wit and <UNK> to guide them this is a fine entry in the ealing cannon terry thomas <UNK> as usual in the lead as a <UNK> <UNK> man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts <UNK> the interest of the world ian <UNK> makes a great romantic lead peter sellers puts in one of his <UNK> performances as a corrupt <UNK> and the uber suave john le <UNK> plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader lots of fun is had by all especially the viewer perhaps not in the very top <UNK> of ealing classics but pretty high up
<START> the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick a lame reason for <UNK> kumar to date 3 girls very loud over acting by both <UNK> and john abraham <UNK> <UNK> was the highlight of the movie <UNK> <UNK> did well but not as good as his performance in <UNK> <UNK> overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer save your money and don't watch this movie watch <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> again br br <UNK> it a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance the plot was extraordinarily non sense good music by <UNK> the man who bought us <UNK> keep it up movie shot all in one room new <UNK> female cast were okay as it was their first film but established actors like <UNK> and john totally disappointed an established director like <UNK> gives his worst movie ever
<START> not as bad as you've heard there are actually some funny parts and affleck and <UNK> have fairly good chemistry <UNK> in particular is appealing and likable as <UNK> love interest james gandolfini and catherine o'hara are <UNK> professionals they're pretty good in just about everything in the end surviving is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see br br unfortunately it is <UNK> and much of the comedy is forced the attempts at dark humor come off as <UNK> affleck tries hard to be <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but comes across as disturbed his character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and <UNK> more muted believable performances even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies you never fully buy into the set up of affleck renting this family for x <UNK> br br there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their <UNK> the x <UNK> eve scene <UNK> with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked provocative pictures of his mother that not only isn't funny or believable but disturbing br br to make matters worse the colors in this film are <UNK> almost <UNK> the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks <UNK> and cheap br br surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office <UNK> paycheck <UNK> jersey girl and this for affleck it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be
<START> i grew up <UNK> and i know the story this movie is trying to tell although i no longer believe the story i'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average lifetime movie of the week mildly interesting mediocre acting a bit slow the script is predictable the music is sappy and it is a bit melodramatic and all the people left behind have got to be the <UNK> clean non christians ever not a single curse word from any of them but i laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the united nations <UNK> nuclear as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just like bush is there some christian code of honor that <UNK> that since bush claims he too is called by god that all christians must cover up his ignorance by <UNK> that word the same way he does lol i really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that after the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> incident the movie began to feel like <UNK> manipulative propaganda i was looking for something bold actually i was looking for something that might make me think but i didn't find it here if you're looking for mindless entertainment stop here it's good for killing a rainy afternoon but if you're looking for intelligence look elsewhere
<START> colorful western br br <UNK> cowboy james stewart <UNK> on up to the <UNK> territory to dig for gold sell his <UNK> and try to get a date with pretty saloon owner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants stewart's cattle beautiful cinematography in a <UNK> effort by william <UNK> and bill daniels good technicolor adventure from universal international directed by anthony mann br br also starring <UNK> <UNK> connie <UNK> and walter brennan as stewart's sidekick
<START> ok plain and simple if you are a fan of the other tomb <UNK> games yes even <UNK> keep away from legend br br it is without doubt the most disappointing <UNK> game yet it looks very nice it sounds very nice but it is totally <UNK> and i've given up i feel like i've been robbed by <UNK> br br it's very simple <UNK> was a pc game before anything else you control lara using the keyboard in 6 tomb <UNK> games the controls were standard in <UNK> they were <UNK> but still the same general control sequences in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally <UNK> br br i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say <UNK> the <UNK> no why should i others say <UNK> a <UNK> no why should i others say <UNK> this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for <UNK> well i don't care it is not the standard for any other <UNK> game so why mess with it oh i know because they couldn't care less about their original loyal fan base they want to cash in on the new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money pathetic br br my advice to any serious <UNK> fan is keep away from this game and if you do buy it complain to <UNK> i have seen masses of other <UNK> mainly on the <UNK> <UNK> from people telling them how rubbish it is perhaps they will listen
<START> i first <UNK> onto the <UNK> accidentally one night while <UNK> television since then i have never missed an episode br br it's humour is very weird like a cross between <UNK> <UNK> social commentary the fast show's excellent one liners and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere the best example of this was <UNK> <UNK> special stuff what was that all about br br the humour will not appeal to all some will say it's just too sick and it's easy to see where they're coming from nonetheless give it a try if you don't like it don't watch it but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice
<START> once again disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names the most glaring errors are the characters penny does not have her book brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop dr claw is more a show off than an evil villain etc but there are more than that the horrors start from the first minutes of the film having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesn't help <UNK> him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman they introduce brenda who only serves to make this movie disney <UNK> add to this the fact that the claw seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost <UNK> opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be a better storyline to replace it but as you guessed disney failed in that too the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for <UNK> sake and <UNK> after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduced the new <UNK> it doesn't look function or think like the old <UNK> at all it's just the <UNK> comic relief figure disney obviously <UNK> that the gadget cartoons were a comedy so they made the film a comedy too but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the <UNK> face and replaced them with gadget being a moron the <UNK> being a wise ass and claw showing off someone should tell disney that children's movie doesn't imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be targeted for children of 10 12 years not children of 10 12 months like this movie whatever this movie is supposed to be it is not repeat not the real inspector gadget because i love the old gadget i hate this
<START> saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don't get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleep br br the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don't think christmas is nothing but <UNK> after 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who <UNK> him to celebrate christmas after all br br i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy <UNK> that at least was funny
<START> spoiler this movie is based on the concept of what if of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question the main character goes through a bad day like many of us and asks this question chaos theory states a <UNK> in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game this event sets into motion one's destiny just like <UNK> in the <UNK> effect except mr destiny uses comedy over drama the results make a fresh somewhat original movie if one's philosophical are in tune with the <UNK> effect one will likely enjoy mr destiny i give it a 7 out of 10 amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie 3 times and finally watched the ending on <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it i was very moved by this movie i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault as in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with leo who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have <UNK> sex even though fully aware of his hiv status i was also disappointed with leo for <UNK> the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men this is in no way meant to bash gays i am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others the only part of the movie i couldn't understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include marcel in <UNK> illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral br br i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have <UNK> sex
<START> i am a huge horror splatter fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the <UNK> as long as it has a point br br after reading the other people's reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films i've ever watched br br the acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this case br br i <UNK> 11 <UNK> to get this dvd br br unless you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent sh t films avoid at any cost
<START> well the movie was a fun watch the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire <UNK> <UNK> by like vampires that walk in the <UNK> though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams <UNK> this hurts it's really stuck then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while and there are random dream <UNK> that really don't help with the plot come to think of it nothing really made sense but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect come to think of it the fight scenes were <UNK> and the zombies were just fun to watch slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more but you know all in all you can't expect <UNK> list but its a fun watch
<START> wonderful film one of the best horror films of the 70s she is realistic settings and <UNK> as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even <UNK> obviously because most horror movies are old and must be <UNK> is like a mental <UNK> that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here br br before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment in the film a good gift because 10 is really well done raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films he really impression excellent film really i consider a film anthology of <UNK>
<START> this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey <UNK> br br after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment <UNK> you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the f k br br without giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a spoiler br br spoiler alert spoiler alert at the end of the movie it <UNK> i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie
<START> if you love the thin man series you will love this movie <UNK> character of vance is very similar to his character of nick charles there are even dogs br br the chemistry between powell and <UNK> may not be as fabulous as powell and loy but it isn't half bad
<START> well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and sad and yes the guy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was hot interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery i think my mum would like it i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f <UNK> club though
<START> i'll say one thing about this film there are no <UNK> you can't get bored watching this the problem is that it is too intense there is too much action and it needs <UNK> that is the risk you take in modern action films you want it interesting but not overdone this is way overdone br br even though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in gary busey and roy <UNK> it still has the feel of a b film the best part of it is <UNK> dialog the only a part of this b film br br the rest of the story is strictly rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes one in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines that was memorable not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long
<START> this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best the scenario is based on the novel by <UNK> <UNK> and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant br br the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both <UNK> and watson <UNK> definitely gives his best performance to date proving he's worth much more than what we thought watson also performs brilliantly br br the story is about a phenomenal chess player <UNK> which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life the film is presented in a non linear time with multiple flashbacks of <UNK> childhood through those the complex character of luzhin is described br br i have nothing more to say but to suggest this film to anyone
<START> the story of this film is truly remarkable a virus cut loose and only 1 of the human race survived the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say the twelve monkeys did it thats right the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people apparently animals do not contract this disease day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this how it was created if nature did it or a mere human being had created it all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them the deaths began during 1996 1997 and twelve monkeys have something to do with it or at least thats what the poster says so a current convict named james cole bruce willis is sent as a <UNK> to get some <UNK> from above after he does his <UNK> work he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin br br throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times from 1990 to some time during the 1950's in a middle of a war throughout the time traveling back and forth it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it wasn't for the ending i personally didn't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen but it isn't everyone who thinks this way so i gave it a 8 but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7 br br for the whole acting of the film i give it a a bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good but brad pitt is completely 100 excellent his acting is so great he gets into the character so well i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club there characters or similar in this film he is just a little more insane in this film so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out for most people it's a great science fiction film i just don't think it is a masterpiece
<START> the <UNK> william powell he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him the murders are projects barely human beings i have noticed this is a <UNK> of the <UNK> other than an occasional <UNK> widow the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists nothing more there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this there is a lot of political <UNK> especially as it relates to the asian performers this is a little hard to take the cast is great and <UNK> direction is also a consistent asset
<START> that's the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their graves br br i won't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they're so obvious they go without saying small things like this being the all new adventures of laurel and hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made little things like that br br a bad idea would be to have actors playing <UNK> whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy as bad as that is it might have worked for a really bad idea try casting two actors to <UNK> the duo okay they might claim to be <UNK> but the end result is the same br br bronson <UNK> can be funny okay forget his wacky <UNK> cousin larry <UNK> in perfect strangers and look at him in true romance here though he stinks it's probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast all of who are better than the material he was probably just desperate for money there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent this cause is not helped here by <UNK> what is stan <UNK> iranian <UNK> only in <UNK> trademark <UNK> does he come close though as the <UNK> is overdone to the point of tedium that's nothing to write home about <UNK> <UNK> does slightly better as ollie though it's like saying what's worse stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the <UNK> br br remember the originals with their split second timing <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> well that's absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so <UNK> you could park a bus through the gaps whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of <UNK> this one has some long <UNK> mummy <UNK> and what a lousy title that's mixed in with the <UNK> <UNK> scenario i can't claim to have seen every single one of laurel and <UNK> <UNK> movies but i think it's a safe bet that even their <UNK> was <UNK> ahead of this br br maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort of playing themselves or at least using their own accents it at least felt natural and <UNK> as opposed to the contrived caricatures <UNK> and <UNK> are given and since when did stan do <UNK> and so many at that i was gonna give you a standing <UNK> i would like to <UNK> my friend stop it br br only notable moment is a reference to <UNK> the clown the cartoon character who shared larry <UNK> l h comic <UNK> of course bought the name <UNK> how <UNK> to see a <UNK> after laurel and hardy and was co director and producer of this travesty br br questions abound would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today would they glass <UNK> with broken <UNK> have stan being <UNK> in the <UNK> with a <UNK> and end on a big cgi finale let's hope not br br i did laugh once but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is why was this film made in the first place who did the makers think would like it possibly the worst movie i've ever seen an absolute <UNK> i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red hot poker and <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> inserted up your back passage
<START> recently i saw the documentary the revolution will not be <UNK> also know as <UNK> inside the coup at first i thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the <UNK> coup of april 2002 what bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive and that at no point any criticism was expressed about hugo <UNK> this is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non biased account of what happened there should have been some of that too after all <UNK> certainly is not a saint fortunately since the documentary is several years old a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays and it was not difficult to find for instance <UNK> investigation about chavez the coup by the 5 european tv <UNK> who <UNK> the film which presents blatant <UNK> about <UNK> it lists the many errors and intended or <UNK> <UNK> in the documentary just use the title as a search string in <UNK> you will find it another interesting document was the video <UNK> of a presentation of the <UNK> of the many errors in this documentary x ray of a lie to me it seems to be a good <UNK> to <UNK> inside the coup it's available at video <UNK> i strongly advice you after watching <UNK> inside the coup to look at x ray of a lie and then form your opinion my conclusion is that kim <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> or not part in <UNK> propaganda
<START> private practice is supposed to be a medical drama so i guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines just by watching house i solved two out of nine medical mysteries before the doctors did <UNK> seriously if you are a lazy writer why not copy some cases out of older er episodes or some obscure brazilian medical soap house is recent and popular <UNK> their ideas is hard to get away with br br second biggest complaint these people are supposed to be forty somethings right then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15 year olds is three weeks ie three whole damn episodes of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your friend with benefits it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship the character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed drama br br and i won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite <UNK> as we got to know her in <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> don't you think it's funny the way <UNK> ends up <UNK> after loser pete sorry but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with <UNK> <UNK> is a loser <UNK> or not and derek ends up <UNK> in a relationship with whiny irritating meredith miles away in rainy seattle apart from that little <UNK> with mark they seemed to be perfect for each other sometimes i think <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is trying to tell us that in relationships our first choice is often the right one
<START> from start to finish i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie it's amazing that the groove tube is possibly the <UNK> yet <UNK> of all comedic skit movies this is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia for 73 minutes the weird strange humor never stops just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier it's way way better than comedy central or any prime time show do yourself a favor and trash all those soft lame romantic comedy movies into the <UNK> better yet tell your box office manager you want the groove tube back on the big screen
<START> this game has the <UNK> honor of being the first game that i have stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like <UNK> into bits and then burning <UNK> first and last tomb <UNK> i will ever play i assure you br br plot just <UNK> that word made me laugh there isn't one neither is there character development we finally have a girl heroine who can take care of herself who isn't a <UNK> mary sue but unfortunately she dresses like a slut and her breast are huge they had to attract the sexist boy <UNK> you see anyway all she does is go in tomb after tomb shooting things as she goes along why she does this i have no idea i had subtitles on and the t v as loud as i could and i still didn't understand a damn thing the development or lack there of for her her two friends and the villains were laughable there also will be levels that you have to go through that do not give you any hint on what you have to do next and you literally will be in most of the boring as hell <UNK> for hours trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing there is one course out of two in particular with her on a <UNK> believe me it is not at all fun that you will be on for <UNK> an hour with no save point in sight that means you get hit by the other <UNK> and guys in <UNK> shooting at you or you hit a tree you start the hour long trek over br br boss stupid f <UNK> you know lets makes the levels very long have basically no save points have no story no character development give no variety in game play have most of the music on the longest levels ear bleeding and give no hints whatsoever to the player so they can stay even longer in a place instead of getting to the nonexistent plot br br stupid f <UNK> one those sound like bang up ideas br br stupid f <UNK> two i <UNK> who needs character development plot or <UNK> game play br br todd i'm sorry sir but these ideas seem like they will extremely p ss the player off br br boss stupid f <UNK> shut up todd you're fired br br game play all she does is shoot of course she can flip while shooting jump while shooting or kick while again shooting but flipping jumping and kicking does not <UNK> the fact that all she is ultimately doing is shooting boring music the intro music is extremely beautiful i love listening to it the in game music goes from tolerable to wanting to cut your ears off br br visuals considering this game was made in 2006 i was expecting the visuals to blow me away well i was blown but definitely not in a good way br br bottom line this game is a plot less no character development mess with a barely dressed <UNK> thankfully young women in the lead that goes through boring <UNK> for some boring reason what that might be i couldn't tell you with unimaginative shooting <UNK> stay far away from this b s it's gets two stars for having a women who isn't a damsel in distress no matter how scantily clad she might be and the beautiful into music
<START> despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger <UNK> movies it wasn't until about 6 years ago that i first saw <UNK> the <UNK> i knew all the songs from an old astaire rogers record yes <UNK> but knew nothing of the plot br br unfortunately while the songs are catchy and ginger <UNK> character is sweet and funny you just can't like <UNK> <UNK> while trying to make up to his longtime partner he continually <UNK> her career his character doesn't have the usual humour and <UNK> of the other <UNK> astaire characters br br worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers
<START> i thought i had seen this movie twice in fact then i read all the other reviews and they didn't quite match up a man and three young students two girls and a boy go to this town to study alleged bigfoot <UNK> i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw despite the <UNK> in the reviews therefore i'm putting my review back if you like the occasional <UNK> movie as i do then return to <UNK> creek is the movie for you whether it's setting the sleep <UNK> and <UNK> off to your favorite movie bomb or just hanging out with friends <UNK> creek the mute button and you've got a fun night of <UNK> look out is the legend true i think we just might find out along with a not so stellar cast will there be any equipment <UNK> at particularly key moments in the film does our blonde <UNK> young hero have any chest hair will the exceptionally high tech technicolor last the entire film you'll have to watch to find out for yourself
<START> another silent love triangle film from hitchcock not a mystery but very english very well paced and photographed smooth boxer bob <UNK> ian hunter <UNK> circus boxer one round jack <UNK> carl <UNK> to be his <UNK> partner partly to keep the pretty but <UNK> mabel <UNK> hall davis nearby there are lots of character actors and <UNK> jack and <UNK> wedding the <UNK> standing in the <UNK> of the church <UNK> shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men the fat lady the <UNK> twins who of course argue about which side of the <UNK> to sit and the wedding feast is amusing the rest of the movie has jack losing mabel and boxing his way back to her heart or something like that it was another era altogether with the audience in evening dress and the <UNK> dressing up too when out of the ring the camera angles the pace the use of symbols the <UNK> very stylish and masterful the camera work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping <UNK> good looks are well used in this one his smiling is not so oblivious of what's going on around him as he is in hitchcock's the <UNK> and so is not annoying but can <UNK> have such <UNK>
<START> die <UNK> was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in germany i watched it last night and i must admit that i am deeply disappointed if that is supposed to be the last best hope for entertaining and challenging german action cinema well then there is not much left br br die <UNK> tries to be sexy daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind the characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected which doesn't happen too much the act against their nature that makes it hard for me almost impossible to follow them or even identify with them br br most of all i think the film is very bad cast there is not one character in whom i believe maybe the superior officer at the <UNK> unit but that's about it those people that try to look like or act like special <UNK> like elite cops i don't believe them not for a second br br the story is not so bad after all but i think it's badly told you don't get to know the bad guy at all for example and when after a very dark show down karl simon the good guy asks his already dead <UNK> why what for i did ask myself that very same question knowing that <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't have the answer br br i sincerely hope no i believe that germany can do better even with action films
<START> being from a small town in <UNK> myself i can instantly relate to this movie considering the era it was made in the <UNK> look <UNK> like a lot of people i grew up with yes the plot is so so and yes the acting is not going to get nominated for an oscar anytime soon but that isn't the point the point is to suspend reality and just have fun and this movie has fun <UNK> from the greedy <UNK> <UNK> to the well meaning but <UNK> deputy this movie was made to poke fun at the scifi genre and small town living at it's best who can't smile at the sight of the <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> <UNK> and i loved the <UNK> wish i had one when i was growing up overall considering the technology they had available at the time this is a pleasant romp into one's childhood when you could sit back on a saturday afternoon popcorn in hand and laugh at the <UNK> of small town living this is a movie i would watch again and again if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways
<START> i wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this might be a good show this show is only good if you don't know what talent is i won't even say how offensive it is i know it can be offensive to a lot of people because thats not really what bothers me about the show what bothers me is that people watch this and think it's funny it makes me feel like our generation is getting to stupid and i'm actually scared that it will one day be run by people who watch this garbage br br basically the plot is simple it's about an offensive self centered spoiled women sarah <UNK> getting through everyday life br br thats it like that hasn't been done a million times in fact almost every joke either has been done or is racist br br sarah also likes to sing i like her voice thats it not the lyrics the lyrics are dreadful which she likes to sing about a lot of things br br if you like to see a hot women put everyone else down and make them feel like crap while at the same time <UNK> and saying crap about every race then this show is for you
<START> i first started watching this show probably around the year of 2003 or 2004 with my friends of course at the time i was younger and enjoyed some of the jokes on this show i was 11 in 2003 and i am 14 now 2007 though my age probably plays a major role in how i judge this show after reading other's reviews i have come to see that after the third season this show went down the <UNK> i agree this show is obnoxious repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot br br the show revolves around timmy turner who was granted two fairy <UNK> because basically his life was horrible his parents were never around and he had a nasty baby <UNK> the plot of the entire show is that this kid timmy and his <UNK> always wish up some destruction that cannot be prevented by making another wish because something in da rules says they can't the show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated like magic cannot break true love super toilet or even just some <UNK> jokes lines that <UNK> probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times br br the show is aimed at kids younger than 10 because it involves gross situations and kid humor that most kids of my age wouldn't care for the character voice selection could've been better too timmy has an extremely loud shrill feminine voice as does <UNK> <UNK> sounds like an old lady <UNK> dad sounds like some <UNK> or game show host <UNK> mom's voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine attitudes in this show are in some episodes timmy talks back and acts spoiled and <UNK> <UNK> apparently is smart and wise <UNK> is stupid dumb and incapable of thinking as is <UNK> dad <UNK> mom seems to end up doing whatever <UNK> dad does br br the show is too far <UNK> from reality to get my <UNK> anymore maybe as a younger kid i could see more of the humor in this show but as i grow up it really grows old and not to sound <UNK> or <UNK> but the show does have that mentality that makes you want to commit homicidal activity towards the characters a show like this just has to be your attitude if you know what i mean if not it basically <UNK> you
<START> robot <UNK> doesn't suffer from story or bad effects i mean this was 1990 if you know what i'm talking about <UNK> 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the '80s if you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time it wasn't until terminator 2 judgment day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and story <UNK> began to use that motive but you'll have fond memories of transformers gundam wing even power rangers if you watch this film the enemy robot is very menacing it makes you not want to face the man without a really good back up plan and there are some great moments within this film a <UNK> spy is working within their <UNK> who you think is on your side backing you up all the way could be the person you didn't expect him her to be and that's very <UNK> to think so don't you agree
<START> i was disgusted by this movie no it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia <UNK> this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but shows that being entered as <UNK> in the rape trial when she did not paint her first <UNK> for a year after the trial br br i don't know if you understood this from the movie probably not <UNK> was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape <UNK> he continued to claim that he never <UNK> knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again it's true br br i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about don't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work br br don't see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia
<START> i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up quite frankly i'm just happy fido got picked up for us distribution in any case br br ever seen shaun of the dead good how about <UNK> able to <UNK> the two well if you can your name might be andrew <UNK> canadian <UNK> of the first ever family themed zombie comedy or <UNK> seriously that's what the press book in toronto called it though not as violent dry or british as shaun of the dead fido remains true to its roots a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both <UNK> and the infamous sci fi pulp that was being <UNK> out during the period br br <UNK> talented <UNK> carrie anne moss billy <UNK> dylan baker and tim blake nelson stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script the film explores all the <UNK> of its premise a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident what would you use your new undead servant for a butler <UNK> labor a pet <UNK> acts fido <UNK> all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way with much thanks to the work of <UNK> as one of said zombies and young tv actor <UNK> ray who seems at times to be a better young <UNK> wood than the young <UNK> wood was br br if you're expecting another shaun of the dead don't waste your time there's not nearly enough gore and <UNK> at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed but if you're willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake you're in for a treat think of fido as the sensitive more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the <UNK> rebellious loser and you're starting to get the drift if you like or at least tolerate zombies small children and loads of deadpan satire <UNK> the film for you if that's not the case well you know the <UNK> just hit 'em square between the eyes
<START> well for starters this actually was the most elegant <UNK> film to this date br br the man's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension <UNK> to anything he's made earlier his work has in very black <UNK> white words been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and we've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say br br in villa paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the <UNK> not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget set in <UNK> in 'the <UNK> it deals with the <UNK> issue of lack of love but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused and on top of that he himself manages to play a b d a true b d who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there and people therefore suffer <UNK> br br i'd have to say it's one of the best movies i've seen this year and i'm greatly <UNK> his next
<START> i have enjoyed criminal intent series of law and order for a long time kathryn <UNK> <UNK> alexandra <UNK> the female detective is rather hard and seems a bit bitter in the criminal intent series see her other side in this movie br br this movie shows the marvelous soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intent fan this movie is a <UNK> in her acting and you get a pretty darn good yarn of family <UNK> in the south br br i did not like albert <UNK> role in this movie because he did such a convincing acting job of the older southern fellow that is hard headed and <UNK> and <UNK> of change he reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrayal is divine but you will likely find him hard to like in this movie br br <UNK> <UNK> is easy to like in this movie and why i recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent law and order fans
<START> this movie has an all star cast john candy richard lewis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shepard and jim belushi to name a few run <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> as well as some other beautiful european locations and is very funny the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and i highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it john candy is in top form in once upon a crime as is everyone else if you and your family are looking for a great family film this is your ticket everyone gives stellar performances great acting great comedy and great timing which is rare in movies these days great plot great mystery which i love anyways and overall well worth the money you spend on it so get the kids grab some popcorn juice or tea or <UNK> and enjoy the show
<START> i have seen bad movies before but this one takes the worst movie of a lifetime award by far anthony hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one anywhere i will never see another movie with him in it directing it etc etc i can't believe the other actors actresses that i liked in this picture that <UNK> so low to be a part of this disaster there must be some great drugs out there for anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film is beyond me save your money on this one huge flop from beginning to end shame on you mr hopkins also shame on christian slater i can't believe you put your <UNK> on the line for this one
<START> wow i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage it's a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids the vignettes are good especially speed demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which michael jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship and it's just as weird as it sounds joe <UNK> is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout br br the real gem however is the incredible smooth criminal video which makes the movie worth <UNK> for that part alone
<START> i wasn't sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this a smart slightly twisted comedy that makes you think i wasn't quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at c o r e to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go you'll be glad you did
<START> <UNK> at sea br br aspect ratio 1 <UNK> 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br black and white br br suffering from <UNK> ollie <UNK> on a <UNK> boat trip but he and stan get mixed up with an escaped convict <UNK> <UNK> chaos ensues br br this feature length comedy an ok entry which nonetheless <UNK> like a mere imitation of laurel and <UNK> best work marked the final collaboration between l h and producer hal roach episodic in structure the movie <UNK> in a memorable ocean voyage after the boys are taken hostage by villainous <UNK> who shoots a <UNK> to prove how tough he is the gags are ok but inspiration is lacking perhaps due to the <UNK> of actor turned director gordon douglas previously responsible for <UNK> first solo effort in the sound era <UNK> produced in 1939 but whose work here lacks a measure of <UNK> fair but nothing special l h <UNK> charlie hall and james <UNK> make guest appearances
<START> holes is my all time favorite movie so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to <UNK> it on dvd this upcoming september i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were the director of this film did an excellent job of re creating the book into movie form also all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters especially max <UNK> as <UNK> props to all those involved in making this movie it was a real success 10 out of 10 stars i definitely recommend it for everyone to see
<START> after seeing several movies of <UNK> i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in <UNK> he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by <UNK> br br recommended
<START> since <UNK> ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years obviously the <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> should be out of ideas after <UNK> down all of the characters adding even <UNK> new ones replacing some voices though i like nancy <UNK> she is not <UNK> <UNK> and having no sense of continuity ex in a <UNK> episode i watched the other day tommy and <UNK> each got a new puppy but it subsequent episode the aforementioned dogs never appear you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy but <UNK> br br all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks while not as horrible as the <UNK> episodes everyone is even <UNK> than they were including grandpa my god he used to be the best character on the show but now he has no real purpose the ending is needlessly <UNK> and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes <UNK> <UNK> is that the kids can interact with adults <UNK> what fun br br no stars at all for the <UNK> all <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> please destroy this show before it gets any worse
<START> these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part 6 battlefield earth and <UNK> had those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful i haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and <UNK> before i start the review let me tell you the story theodore rex is a 35 million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters they cut the <UNK> sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight to video movie in decades whoopi <UNK> in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck br br plot a millionaire <UNK> dinosaurs so he can launch <UNK> at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age a female cop named katie <UNK> and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur br br the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which <UNK> the movie of all its mystery then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful whoopi looks <UNK> and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no <UNK> theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen most of the jokes <UNK> around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail on accident and on purpose i thought <UNK> was bad but it takes a <UNK> to theodore rex the worst movie of <UNK> career br br don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable i didn't see that when i watched this movie all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the <UNK> cousin of barney utterly painful from start to finish
<START> one woman by herself in a house for 45 minutes of screen time doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge of your seat but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come writer star vivian <UNK> takes on those little fears we all <UNK> and <UNK> them to terrifying proportions so don't watch this film alone
<START> kept my attention from start to finish great performances added to this tremendous film mr pacino once again gives us another brilliant character to enjoy
<START> i watched this film in <UNK> joy br br this is possibly one of the best films of all time it has a timeless value you can get so much out of it it's amazing there are parts that are moving funny and just great br br all aspect are spot on the portrayal of the story is perfect every detail is 100 genuine even small irish subtleties have been covered br br the use of low and high shots gives two great views on <UNK> look out for that br br daniel day <UNK> performance is incredible i've never seen an actor do that ever it really is amazing br br and it's so great to watch it flows so well it's probably the closest thing <UNK> can get to real life experience i love it br br if you haven't seen it you should see it don't have any doubts on it there is something there for all
<START> this <UNK> movie looks more like a combination of music clips at mtv than as a real movie there is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself what is going to happen but nothing happens the story around eric <UNK> the frustrated writer is the only good thing the other persons seem to have nothing in common then why bring them together in a movie with music you can make watchable the worst movie when i open the tap and there comes water out with the music of bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie the director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie
<START> i love this movie my friend marcus and i were <UNK> the local <UNK> because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular 2 thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won't this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies do you really think nothing is <UNK>
<START> slight spoilers but it doesn't matter anyway br br an exercise in <UNK> of <UNK> proportions not even worthy of the <UNK> lines i need to put these remarks on the <UNK> this is the single worst episode of the masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the <UNK> mystery science theatre treatment even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle it was still a very lame mess its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting dialogue and acting editing and timing are put to use here they are absent and john carpenter is no master period and no trite analysis of the easy social comment <UNK> will change that oddly carpenter never has been anything more than a b director but at least such films as <UNK> and 'the <UNK> had terrific atmosphere the latter is one of my cult favorites br br <UNK> acting camera angles stuck in <UNK> <UNK> rhythm yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course <UNK> cannot really be blamed for unless the writers were buddies of cody the initial two minute <UNK> mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be <UNK> <UNK> duo is the first and last thing that works in the film but come on a girl <UNK> through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> of a pair of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner oh and i won't even <UNK> about how the doc <UNK> the <UNK> into the car and <UNK> away at 0 to 60 in six seconds does wonders for possible broken <UNK> or <UNK> br br then things fall apart real quick the vacuous dialogue i just want to help you the <UNK> <UNK> back and forth at the gate <UNK> battle tactics like cutting the <UNK> line in the age of cell phones followed by the the shoot out a born again <UNK> clinic director vs ron <UNK> and the high school <UNK> out for a few kicks at <UNK> break another lovely line so what are we going to do from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault <UNK> in the back of the van er no it isn't yet <UNK> season so who needs those teen boys anyway what about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who <UNK> his way through the gate with his all american <UNK> br br as for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves the cuts here were as stiff as the <UNK> of a <UNK> comics strip all that was lacking were the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the balloon titles and all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old <UNK> episode br br at one point we learn that daddy isn't really the daddy but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either this story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins yet there is not a single scene flashback or not where they are actually ever found together they remain mere <UNK> to each other throughout br br with the exception of the <UNK> every single one of the characters is absolutely <UNK> bland hysterical dull headed macho as perfectly flat as human <UNK> can be none of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them and there's that <UNK> dad who <UNK> at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the <UNK> out boyfriend he fortunately got his there are two great <UNK> worthy comic moments the <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> goes out and later the new born <UNK> with a glued on <UNK> head also cute was <UNK> <UNK> ball belly before she finally popped the right to life little monster from hell as for that <UNK> male abortion scene well they should have <UNK> miike's episode and banned this one instead br br in short a 3rd rate rosemary's baby meets alien set on the <UNK> of a m a s h episode this stinker alone <UNK> only to today's <UNK> under 16 generation will assure as someone else said here that this series will not be <UNK> for a third season a real shame since there have been a number of brilliant productions including such really decent spoofs as <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> deliciously quirky <UNK> <UNK> not to mention the superb imagery of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br sorry john carpenter i believe your directing days are over it's time to run for president
<START> after just watching five across the eyes i gotta be honest i just didn't like it i had read so many good reviews on this movie but i just <UNK> get where these reviews have came from br br i have got a lot of time for <UNK> into film making and i'm sure the directors will do well for themselves but the budget they had was the main problem there was two cameras used in the entire film which was ok but they seemed like really cheap cameras another problem was the sound you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time all talking on top of each other it's just impossible to hear what they're saying br br it had a good idea going for it in a nutshell they hit a <UNK> car then drive off a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit driven by a mad woman who wants to kill them and has plenty of chances to do so and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape but don't br br very frustrating i only just <UNK> through this one
<START> this film was just painful to watch not in the good dramatic way that makes you cringe with emotions for well developed characters in dramatic situations yeah i pretty much made that last sentence up as i went along but in just an absolute dull way for over two hours now you all may think i'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for shakespeare or artistic film making well you'd be wrong on both counts i love the works of shakespeare especially the <UNK> of romeo and juliet <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hamlet and i've watched plenty of <UNK> films such as the surreal and well made <UNK> and <UNK> 8 1 2 but this was just over two hours of lost in translation shakespeare way too much nudity i can understand artistic nudity in some scenes but not in every other shot of a movie it was pointless and served nothing for the story and basically just <UNK> film making i had high expectations for this film in that it was said to be very artistic and was an adaptation of shakespeare's the <UNK> but this was just an extreme letdown i gave this film a three only because of sir john <UNK> acting presence which far <UNK> all of the no names in this film and the cinematography set design combination as it made a lot of scenes look like paintings in motion however a lot of this film would've been better off as just a painting with a <UNK> of text below it a true disappointment maybe if <UNK> had been given the director's chair this would've been much better but this is one audience <UNK> opinion many others may enjoy this far more than me that being said if you can't find this at any nearby video stores it's currently not on dvd don't try to go too far out of your way to find it it's not really worth it
<START> this is one of my favorite movies of all time it's great and the acting is brilliant in the scene in which michael caine calls the police in tears and then stops the <UNK> the second he finishes the call really displays <UNK> brilliance the twists are a lot of fun the film is top notch
<START> but this is a great martial arts film liu <UNK> <UNK> ranks second to none as a fight choreographer only sammo hung at his best <UNK> this is immediately clear from his proud <UNK> of technique rather than flashy camera angles etc during fights the direction is tightly controlled to not only <UNK> the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed this film benefits also from <UNK> participation in front of the camera <UNK> performance at the <UNK> scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history liu is supported by the beautiful and talented <UNK> <UNK> hung of my young <UNK> fame and <UNK> <UNK> whose <UNK> are breathtaking and <UNK> to any amount of <UNK> as for the plot this film follows the not <UNK> theme of revenge but with character and moral development along the way and a most fitting resolution the humour in this is also of the best if you only watch one kung fu film ever this would be a good choice it has it all
<START> if i didn't know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn't it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september 11
<START> i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor <UNK> performance in every sense of the word a tour de force the atmosphere of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through the cinematography and production design really <UNK> techniques used in the best film <UNK> of the 40's and early 50's very nice attention to detail also during frankie <UNK> wallace ford's wake the <UNK> are all praying in <UNK> max <UNK> score is unforgettable as in later films such as <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> folk <UNK> to lend local color and a sense of place and time john ford already a film giant in <UNK>
<START> i had no real expectations going into this movie and i'm glad even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointed br br where to start first i think 15 of the movie consisted of stock footage of <UNK> scarecrows in a dark jungle field i get it there's scarecrows i think the title scarecrows was sufficient br br second not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and <UNK> <UNK> there's too many times where i was left going wtf br br third the movie takes itself seriously i'm all for a b movie with <UNK> of blood screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse but those movies often know they're b movies and even <UNK> it like dead snow hilarious <UNK> zombie flick or evil dead 2 but this movie seems oblivious to its <UNK> br br finally there should of been more blood and or nudity <UNK> i said it if you're going to have a crap horror movie make with the killing and if you're going to have one hot and one semi hot girl one of them needs to show some side <UNK> at a minimum br br so like the summary says skip scarecrows and just poke yourself in the eye you'll thank me
<START> the only part lacking in this movie is <UNK> part as the daughter wanting to follow in her <UNK> footsteps as a daytime soap star otherwise it would be a perfect 10 br br it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script i have to wonder if a little ad <UNK> wasn't taking place in parts it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you br br it's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once i'd recommend not drinking anything that would <UNK> coming out your nose br br you'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely <UNK> <UNK> has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you br br if you love daytime <UNK> or despise them this move <UNK> fun in all the right places
<START> i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5 2 10 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan <UNK> concerning mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of time and i'm trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o
<START> didn't know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling book tried guessing from the opening scenes what it would be about best guess buried treasure and a death list that lasted about 15 minutes when i got the <UNK> suspicion that the film was crap i'll not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film makers i watched until the hero jumped into his <UNK> to rush to the hospital he had his on his suit shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in <UNK> and a t shirt couldn't even get the continuity right i got the christian theme hard to miss it
<START> this man's navy is as other comments have <UNK> a rare and well filmed look at navy lighter than air <UNK> activities the <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> proud that the <UNK> they <UNK> never lost a ship to submarine attack and the filming at the various <UNK> locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of <UNK> that is long gone however the first half of the movie is all about <UNK> his relationship with his service pals and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother and getting <UNK> leg fixed only then does the second film start the second film is mostly <UNK> in action taking on a <UNK> sub guys get killed and much damage is caused the look is fairly gritty and realistic i imagine then we shift to <UNK> asia did the navy have <UNK> there never mind this part is really wild with a <UNK> being used to <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> from the jungle and the <UNK> are shooting like mad shades of vietnam except the <UNK> is oh so <UNK> this is a <UNK> we're talking about in the end a feel good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war
<START> i haven't seen this don't plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless until poor little rich girl <UNK> out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july 2007 br br in fact i don't know anyone that has gone to see any of <UNK> recent movies i rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career until she <UNK> up her act all of the recent publicity has only <UNK> her movie making career if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies br br up to this time movie producers have <UNK> sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production now lindsay will probably have to go to <UNK> actually compete for any role her reputation is currently poison quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in br br <UNK> now lindsay is going to have to deal with not being wanted is she going to be able to handle this br br i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show br br all of the <UNK> is merely my opinion i have no inside information
<START> if he wanted to be accurate he should have chosen some <UNK> natives and not a bunch of ny actors who know nothing about the <UNK> free not sucker free i've lived in sf my entire life and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did everything was over <UNK> and the only cat i saw from the bay was <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> with his little cameo as a <UNK> no shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ie his warriors jersey not once did i notice anyone wearing any giants or <UNK> gear instead he <UNK> them in some cheesy made up sf or <UNK> <UNK> that aren't even sold around here <UNK> has no <UNK> <UNK> black and asian <UNK> do not wear head or <UNK> with the colors of africa or <UNK> olympic team nor does every chinese gangster wear a <UNK> <UNK> jersey and try and sound black while shooting <UNK> further while there now is a significant <UNK> community that has <UNK> the mission all that was shown was some white dude and a self <UNK> 100 west coast <UNK> this is not new york puerto <UNK> here are few and far between and the <UNK> in the mission are very very different from the one that was shown here who was without a doubt from ny also <UNK> is not the only black neighborhood in the city an accurate depiction would have shown the drama between <UNK> sets in their own hood as well as vs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc br br this film could've been much better if lee had done some more <UNK> and had a better storyline to work with
<START> when the scientist and family man matt <UNK> robert <UNK> finally accepts the <UNK> to work the <UNK> <UNK> corporation in a space suit project he moves with his beloved wife patricia joanna cassidy and their son <UNK> <UNK> oliver and daughter <UNK> <UNK> moon frye to a huge modern house in the corporation compound they meet their friend tom peterson joe <UNK> and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle and tom invites the <UNK> family to join the steaming springs country club tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a <UNK> professional <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> but matt is not tempted with the offer later he is introduced to the director of the club jessica jones susan <UNK> that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club finding an evil secret about jessica and the members br br in the 80's when i saw <UNK> to hell i liked this movie that partially recalls the <UNK> wives with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound i have just seen it today and i found a great <UNK> message against the big <UNK> when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher <UNK> i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story but i believe it fits perfectly my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> o <UNK> <UNK> to hell
<START> robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie <UNK> is the main character in this film at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the <UNK> or james stewart in the naked <UNK> but as the film goes along <UNK> keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him stewart granger is sandy <UNK> who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the <UNK> will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing <UNK> is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings debra <UNK> as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self <UNK> censorship of that time she lies with <UNK> in total <UNK> even though she hates him the last scene of a frozen <UNK> is unforgettable
<START> i loved the way earth is made its photography is unbelievable editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart's voice over is perfect in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you don't want to miss you really are on a journey to where you would probably never ever end up by yourself br br and although at first i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival i could not help laughing myself sometimes nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend br br but rather than the need to laugh i left the cinema with a profound question <UNK> 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years br br with this question in mind you'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and <UNK> after seeing earth i felt the immediate need to change the world to help all these animals in their struggle to <UNK> the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global <UNK> at once all that not being a <UNK> <UNK> at all br br so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our still fantastic planet and the polar bear from its depressing fate www <UNK> com br br i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through br br i hope that cutting on my energy use will do i don't know how else to <UNK> the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they <UNK> or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state br br an inspiring film it is but i didn't leave the cinema feeling very happy
<START> the fact that this movie made it all the way to the <UNK> in <UNK> is bizarre this movie is just awful this image quality is just one <UNK> bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is <UNK> bad the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck every person <UNK> with this movie should be ashamed the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary and the <UNK> did they even see it this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it
<START> i watched the first 15 minutes thinking it was a real documentary with an <UNK> overly dramatic on camera producer br br when i realized it was all staged i thought why would i want to waste my time watching this junk so i turned it off and came online to warn other people the characters don't act in a believable way too much immature emotion for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country he acted like a kid and i don't believe it was because his character was so upset about the trade center <UNK> br br very trite and stupid br br have you seen city of lost children french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams i liked it
<START> i watched this today partially attracted to the all star cast and partly because i have enjoyed so many other films of this <UNK> however this is one to avoid there are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow the <UNK> challenge at the start for example the fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white tarzan movies you know where you see a <UNK> fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying <UNK> on the floor with it sticking from his <UNK> is that <UNK> death there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers the really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch if you do see this movie the <UNK> which inch forward at about <UNK> are the highlight somehow one manages to creep up on david <UNK> and give him a <UNK> its as if there was no time to get out of the way like when the <UNK> in the city falls over the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left but no he screams and it falls on him i only give this a 2 because of <UNK> and why does <UNK> voice develop a <UNK> as the movie progresses
<START> stargate is the best show ever all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles i love the connection between the characters if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star <UNK> unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time which is highly depressing however this program is very very good and is a must see but be warned it is highly <UNK> so in <UNK> i love stargate and amanda <UNK>
<START> blood of the sacred blood of the damned is the third installment of the gabriel knight games a series of adventure games about the <UNK> writer <UNK> detective gabriel knight gabriel and his companion grace have been asked by prince james of <UNK> to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so called night <UNK> when the son of prince james is kidnapped gabriel <UNK> the night <UNK> to <UNK> le <UNK> where he begins <UNK> together a mystery relating to the holy grail br br despite the marketing this game is not about vampires vampires have a token appearance in the game but never command center stage as did the voodoo <UNK> in sins of the fathers or the werewolves in the beast within gabriel and grace make no attempt to <UNK> the true nature of vampires or to research <UNK> on vampires although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot br br a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight <UNK> was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains through these relationships the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster however in blood of the sacred <UNK> only interaction with the villain is through a single cheesy interview which does nothing to <UNK> the villain to the player br br the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly <UNK> gabriel spends his time <UNK> into the identities of members of a treasure hunter tour group staying at his hotel but what he <UNK> amounts to nothing more than a red <UNK> grace spends her time <UNK> the mystery of <UNK> le <UNK> but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a <UNK> ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries br br the actions of this <UNK> ally and his polar opposite the vampire leader are <UNK> the ally leaves hints about the mystery of <UNK> le <UNK> in broad daylight and expects grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them however he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours and in the end he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway br br meanwhile the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming because he chooses to <UNK> from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child the only reason given for his decision to <UNK> action is that he wants to <UNK> his victory br br the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail the kidnapping and vampires should have been <UNK> replaced with a race against the <UNK> to <UNK> the mystery of <UNK> le <UNK> since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development br br all in all the game was a disappointing installment in the series despite an improved <UNK> and the return of tim <UNK> as the voice of gabriel knight
<START> i live in <UNK> where this film was made and i really wish it hadn't been this is one god awful flick i really try and support independent films but there is this <UNK> attached to anything indie and that <UNK> is indie films blow well this film does nothing to shed this curse the actor writer director brett kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re <UNK> tired clichés from movies past i am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that <UNK> in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it's way too overdone br br i can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car <UNK> now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the <UNK> budget of this movie as well for a movie that <UNK> to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn <UNK> and red food <UNK> br br the biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this <UNK> fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back not that this concept bugs me but i didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other this is done in such a short time span that it's <UNK> my first <UNK> would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her br br the last point that i have is and i won't hold this against kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring <UNK> video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just <UNK> style on film although if this movie were given a million dollar <UNK> and <UNK> the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie <UNK> my only hope is that something happens to prevent brett kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting br br lord help us all
<START> an excellent depiction of one of the more <UNK> aspects of that era i loved the visuals very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel br br i thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work which he didn't fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen don't want to spoil the plot but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action gangster format it is violent though
<START> oh my god i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious that is what it gets those three points for other than that it was atrocious it <UNK> meant to be this funny that much is obvious but the dubbing the acting of the dubbed voices the dialogue they said where often hilarious the actions performed and or not performed also lead to much hilarity and or throwing things at the screen such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass or the attempted escapes from the church in which they hole up br br evil mayor i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window br br hero ok br br evil mayor now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and <UNK> around with fire being totally <UNK> and getting <UNK> up br br insert sequence in which this occurs br br evil mayor damn wait i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry <UNK> seemingly <UNK> to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee insert sequence in which this occurs br br hero upstairs he is trying to escape again fool and he has left the door open he is silly this is a nice view br br woman where is my daughter br br hero <UNK> now i dont know i cannot see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire <UNK> and she is standing right outside where on earth could she be br br needless to say anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this so watch the first film with a couple of friends having a few drinks and make sure by the time you get to watching this one you are absolutely <UNK> drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all and there <UNK> even any decent gore such a shame
<START> a call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here his camera <UNK> around <UNK> in a museum after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape <UNK> up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with a sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching a tv program about <UNK> and stages his first finale during a <UNK> <UNK> dressed to kill is <UNK> primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial much of the acting with the exception of young keith gordon is mediocre and the second finale is a rip off of de palma's own carrie not to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in a <UNK> cold way the end results are distinctly half baked from
<START> i know the film <UNK> are <UNK> but if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b movie jungle try jake speed br br a little thin at times but its one liners and the location more then make up for this john hurt god love him seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white <UNK> the nemesis of <UNK> jake speed he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide crawford and dennis christopher <UNK> sidekick are a good team although you do wonder why they both put up with each other however together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that if you can get over yourself for a moment you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide the delicious karen <UNK> does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her <UNK> then her <UNK> br br i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy or <UNK> down the movie by trying too hard not every movie has to be the latest citizen kane and trust me wells was an original so lets remember that sometimes movies are for fun not social commentary or attempting to <UNK> an audience politically but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero's live in a celluloid dimension
<START> a group of people are invited to there high school reunion but after they arrive they discover it to be a <UNK> by an old <UNK> they played an almost fatal prank on now he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by <UNK> all the <UNK> and cutting off all <UNK> lines br br dark slasher film with an <UNK> premise bringing it up a notch are a few good performances some rather creative death scenes plenty of excitement scares some humor and an original ending br br <UNK> for extreme violence graphic nudity sexual situations profanity and drug use
<START> as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies unlike others however i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a <UNK> post must have been like plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made this occurs when harry's <UNK> group has to <UNK> a tribe of cannibals the pre censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that <UNK> europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps <UNK> an accurate account of how horribly treated the native <UNK> were by their white <UNK> in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two <UNK> not to be missed an adventure classic
<START> enterprise the latest high budget spin off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90 minute episode called <UNK> <UNK> first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a <UNK> being chased by some <UNK> who are the main enemy in the first season of the show from there the <UNK> movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is with some of the best character development story and action visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time br br the opening credits is a <UNK> subject among the minority of enterprise fans whom some believe that the song is out of place what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves if one <UNK> to the actual song instead of the theme then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together and eventually as the series progresses further and further and we learn more about our <UNK> captain and his crew will the song actually become meaningful overall diane <UNK> theme is beautifully <UNK> and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson br br what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered enterprise is in my opinion one of the most well cast shows since the next generation choosing scott <UNK> as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean luc <UNK> as the captain always leads the show <UNK> adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood <UNK> in their <UNK> he simply is both actor wise and character wise a superb human being and his charm wit and compassion are overwhelming to watch as for the other cast members a favourite of mine is john <UNK> who plays dr <UNK> it's also nice to see a non human playing a role and the decision to give the captain a dog named <UNK> was a well received idea throughout the show character development was brilliant it was fast well timed and almost perfect i say almost because sadly travis <UNK> character played by the <UNK> anthony <UNK> is a little weak at the end of the first season he does have some things to say here and there but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dominic <UNK> as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the <UNK> officer connor <UNK> plays commander charles trip tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting all of these characters make up enterprise and all bring a quality that star trek hasn't seen in a long time each person makes this show worth watching smiles and feel good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise <UNK> <UNK> br br the ship itself the <UNK> <UNK> is somewhat questionable in design the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid <UNK> century ships namely the <UNK> class starship continuity has been an issue in enterprise but thankfully rick <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them continuity is only a problem if you are forever <UNK> shows and are obsessed with the <UNK> of details if you see the show with and open mind then you'll have no problems but there is an urge to know <UNK> all the time so what did <UNK> and <UNK> offer to the star trek fan base with the issue of the <UNK> of the ship itself according to them the <UNK> <UNK> is how it is because of the incident in first contact when <UNK> <UNK> saw the enterprise e through his <UNK> and from speaking with the away team lead by commander <UNK> it changed the ideas in his head that's a good enough explanation for me lets move on of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer come on guys grow up when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy fans couldn't do anything only watch and <UNK> it all up anyway and then they learned that well maybe its not that bad after all if you can't accept a quality show for what it is not what it should be in your mind then go elsewhere or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do br br the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the <UNK> from deep space nine they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military perhaps that why the crew of the <UNK> enterprise aka <UNK> of the american fleet like it so much they are striking sets and represent the show perfectly br br rick <UNK> 'the <UNK> of the <UNK> as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart <UNK> <UNK> has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have and in all the right places whether that be <UNK> visuals sound editing or score enterprise is a fine <UNK> to just how good <UNK> science fiction can ultimately be when in the hands of geniuses the late gene <UNK> would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan so should you
<START> i was dying to see this once i saw the ridiculous <UNK> poster and <UNK> that it had to be the best satire ever what a brilliant idea for a satire the genre is <UNK> unfortunately the finished product as i think all involved probably realize is a <UNK> of missed opportunities not quite there performances and thankfully a few extremely hilarious inspired bits <UNK> <UNK> who is very striking looks really bad here probably because she is <UNK> struggling to make her flat role funny david hyde pierce is just sad to watch trying to hard to be funny and looking like a castro nerd molly shannon is so funny just seeing her makes you laugh but somehow her segment fails to <UNK> into something hysterical paul rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell the other guys are also really funny the <UNK> ones i think the problem is the director just doesn't move things along at the right pace he starts out very deadpan and that sets the <UNK> but when he lets things get really outrageous the drug sequence is the second funniest moment i've had all year in movies the first also coming in a lame movie <UNK> martin in all over the guy complaining about the movie in out it's just plain funny i wanted this movie to work so badly but it just didn't the clothes and <UNK> for 1981 are 99 9 perfect and the very few songs used are also perfect this ends up as a medium bad mad tv episode complete with <UNK> overlong sketches
<START> it is not an easy film to watch it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations yet it is so incredibly compelling and <UNK> <UNK> of the human character that it is in my humble opinion one of the very greatest films of all time br br the film is depressing cynical and cruel if you want something uplifting see jacques <UNK> fantastic <UNK> and julie go <UNK> which was made around the same time it shows the <UNK> of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change br br it involves a supposedly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between alexandre played by jean pierre <UNK> marie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yet alexandre is shown to be as <UNK> and jealous as any other man the women are exposed as being willingly <UNK> and defining their <UNK> through the male <UNK> br br the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it jean pierre <UNK> was one of the key actors of the new wave having starred among other films in the influential les <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1959 by <UNK> <UNK> as a rebellious teenager director jean <UNK> is not as well known as other directors from the new wave but he should be br br there is no <UNK> unlike in john <UNK> similar films made in the us and the dialogue comes from real life conversations the film is <UNK> with <UNK> personal experiences for example <UNK> <UNK> was a former lover of <UNK> <UNK> himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real life person that the character marie was based on did too the anger and <UNK> all <UNK> in a harrowing monologue by <UNK> delivered directly to the audience breaking down the <UNK> objective nature of the rest of the film this <UNK> personal and honest <UNK> statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around
<START> first things first i was never once scared of this underrated gem as a kid little mermaid on the other hand as my title says this was one of my <UNK> childhood movies that i still love as a teenager it's a beautiful bittersweet movie about a <UNK> german shepherd called charlie <UNK> voiced by burt reynolds who is killed by his boss partner in crime is name ha ha is carface charlie is sent straight to heaven by <UNK> because all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are naturally good and loyal and kind <UNK> gets sent back to earth 'cause he <UNK> up his life clock where he gets into even more <UNK> with his best friend itchy and a little orphan girl anne marie i used to watch this all the time as a kid and i still sometimes watch it anyways it's a beautiful bittersweet film as i said before that might just leave a tear in your eye
<START> i saw this movie in 1959 when i was 11 years old at a drive in theater with my family br br way back then i thought it was very funny even though i was too young to understand 90 of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight i saw it again this morning on turner south as i watched it i was absolutely <UNK> with laughter the <UNK> game is a unique classic from a by gone age if you're too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film i feel very sorry for you there's no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can even today deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to old <UNK> like me br br having said that all i can do is <UNK> request that younger people <UNK> from commenting on films like the <UNK> game br br movies like this were made for the generation that <UNK> the current group of your people and as such these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand br br in other words  if you don't understand the issues the film is addressing please don't embarrass yourself by offering comments which  frankly  make no sense
<START> i think it's a great movie it's fun maybe a little unrealistic but fun and dramatic i would like to see it again if they were showing it in tv just 1 question are we still talking about the same movie
<START> honestly before i watched this movie i had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace i did not believe that since morgan freeman and kevin spacey have taken roles in this movie and watched it by my own apparently they were right i was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie why the hell did i watch this movie br br of course i was not expecting much from justin as he really does not belong in the movie theater business but morgan and kevin i could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in edison to be honest their roles are rather stupid br br well you might think if the players suck then i should pay more attention to the story it is indeed story is the core of a movie but guys trust me this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story imagine this a smart ass journalist justin timberlake wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a <UNK> journalist from his boss morgan freeman this all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice ll cool j and an brilliant investigator kevin spacey at the end they beat the system with a happy ending story br br <UNK> i could not even carry on with this just <UNK> the movie is making me sick already my advise guys don't watch this please save your money and time for another movie
<START> john <UNK> 1998 the general was <UNK> as a major comeback though it's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin <UNK> alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some <UNK> but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever with a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a <UNK> table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only <UNK> but actually suggest a <UNK> a <UNK> with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film it doesn't get it instead it's <UNK> with what may well be brendan <UNK> worst and most <UNK> performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner <UNK> of a complex character on the plus side this helps not to <UNK> a character who is nothing more than an <UNK> thug but it's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics br br there's a minor section that picks up interest when the ira <UNK> up a local hate campaign against the <UNK> and his men painting them as <UNK> <UNK> drug dealers purely because <UNK> won't share his <UNK> from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and joining the <UNK> which we're expected to find <UNK> <UNK> that it's just thrown away things are more successful in the last third as the pressure <UNK> and his army falls apart but by then it's too late to really care adrian <UNK> maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous <UNK> ball do good work in <UNK> supporting roles but jon <UNK> hammy <UNK> beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> non involvement in what feels like a total misfire come back <UNK> all is forgiven
<START> i attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of <UNK> an interpretation in my opinion will <UNK> a lot of people in addition i am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely <UNK> never before had i wished for a negative score to rate a movie so if you wish to be <UNK> to <UNK> by those without authority then by all means get this film this comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will <UNK> a lot of people as well this was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were <UNK> the film's only <UNK> quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the time machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future
<START> daniel day lewis does a remarkable job of playing christy brown the artist who grew up with cerebral <UNK> but managed to have a <UNK> life dealing successfully with his <UNK> and becoming a respected artist and writer br br the film however is a very difficult one to review or even watch fortunately i had the <UNK> feature on to catch every spoken word which would have been impossible if i saw the film in a theater while i respect it as a brave piece of work dealing with difficult subject matter i can't say it's the sort of film i'd want to view more than once br br nevertheless my attention was held by the story telling device a flashback framed by the present in which we see christy being <UNK> for his achievements before we see the flashback to his youth and his struggles to communicate with those around him who certainly gave him loving care br br daniel day lewis certainly is remarkable as the troubled man who falls in love with a <UNK> <UNK> shaw much to his mother's fear that when the love is not <UNK> his heart will be broken there's a painfully long scene in a restaurant where he <UNK> his love to her before others and then goes into a <UNK> rage after drinking too much br br brenda <UNK> does a brilliant job as the mother taking care of him his father and a <UNK> of siblings while struggling to keep a roof over their heads until day lewis begins to have success with his work she <UNK> day <UNK> performance as the warm hearted mother and shares many poignant moments with him br br richly detailed story of a family that stayed together under the most unusual of circumstances with attention to period detail in every frame of the film both <UNK> and day lewis won oscars but hugh <UNK> and ray <UNK> are also excellent <UNK> is christy as a boy and <UNK> is the father who spends too much time at the local pub but loves the boy br br <UNK> up elmer <UNK> music is an added plus factor well worthwhile but definitely not a film for everyone
<START> oh yes <UNK> killers is a goofy horrible ninja movie make no mistake but it's also an incredibly enjoyable one this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck <UNK> who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes i suppose he's supposed to be sort of an <UNK> wan <UNK> type the tough ninja buster the box copy <UNK> but his <UNK> is laughable move without thinking my friend says this is the sign of mental <UNK> not of supreme concentration br br but really his two <UNK> sonny and dennis have such horrible dialogue that <UNK> as we call the colonel tends to shine in comparison especially watch for <UNK> logic regarding the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> are involved with if you know anything about <UNK> you will die laughing and yes this is a major plot point folks br br a terribly fun movie <UNK> killers is a hard to find gem i won't spoil the <UNK> ending for you either except that it's a perfect set up for a <UNK> killers 2 too bad chuck <UNK> died because he does have a the <UNK> ways of blowing away ninjas
<START> randall <UNK> raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the game when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for british crime boss raymond <UNK> the job involves <UNK> 50 cars in 24 hours or <UNK> will <UNK> his punishment so raines quickly <UNK> a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand but the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes it would seem a near impossible job to complete br br it's got quite a cast has gone in 60 seconds nicolas cage angelina jolie robert duvall will <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jones <UNK> <UNK> christopher <UNK> scott <UNK> timothy <UNK> all of whom deserve better enough acting <UNK> there to <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trouble is is that this is very much a case of too many cars <UNK> the car park <UNK> characters not enough <UNK> from the off we are in no doubt that this is a bruckheimer simpson production <UNK> script laced with loud noises and <UNK> of cheese <UNK> editing and directed with <UNK> subtly by dominic <UNK> it's essentially a big budget remake of h b <UNK> 1974 indie movie of the same name with the premise offering up the potential for an <UNK> <UNK> car based movie potential that sadly is never realised there's one or two high impact moments <UNK> for sure but enjoyable none the less but if you <UNK> the pun the film never gets out of first gear it's more content to <UNK> with its <UNK> of characters who <UNK> about trying to make the <UNK> screenplay scott <UNK> work br br car fans will get something from it the cars are ace on the eye as will fans of unintentional comedy movies check out <UNK> carpenter grief moment but no it's really rather poor all told 4 10
<START> first off i really enjoyed zombi 2 by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldn't stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi 3 has nothing to do with zombi 2 is even more a joke br br we jump from voodoo to death 1 the <UNK> agent <UNK> people back to life whatever this movie isn't worth the 1 00 it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi 3 is an <UNK> for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be i think i will just skip them br br zombi 2 is an awesome <UNK> tho
<START> overshadowed by braveheart released the same year the two costume dramas beg comparison i admit my bias against mel gibson yet i maintain a rational <UNK> for rob roy both braveheart and rob roy <UNK> depict <UNK> history in bloody romantic fashion braveheart is an epic <UNK> to individual honor and courage and a fine revenge fantasy it's also melodramatic <UNK> and <UNK> note its <UNK> usage of slow motion filming its violence is both ugly and glorious it is the latter quality which makes it more appealing to the adolescent mindset while braveheart surpasses rob roy in sheer levels of carnage not to mention its indulgent running time the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying its action is more understated yet more surprising and clever its sex is less <UNK> yet more erotic rob roy also has a better realized romantic interest its dialog attempts to <UNK> the poetry of the period its <UNK> teeth in the mouths of the actors attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> of the era and tim roth is a <UNK> villain also recommended the last of the <UNK> and the <UNK> you may find the latter more akin to braveheart with its emphasis on blood lust with the former more similar to rob roy in tone all the of the aforementioned movies merit their r ratings for violence
<START> there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled baby <UNK> bunny that was exactly this plot baby faced <UNK> robbed a bank and the money in the <UNK> rolled away and fell into bug's rabbit hole he dressed up as a baby to get into <UNK> hole to retrieve the money the scene in little man where he's looking in the bathroom mirror <UNK> with a <UNK> in his mouth is straight from the cartoon this was a hilarious 5 minute cartoon not so much an entire movie if you are really interested in this buy the bugs bunny dvd it's was much more original the first time 1954 plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and the triumph of villa paranoia the favorite film of the general public actually more important than the jury prize was <UNK> <UNK> brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy villa paranoia which was also selected by the european youth jury <UNK> of its appeal to <UNK> of all ages the following day director actor <UNK> traveled to the remote town of <UNK> pays de <UNK> for a <UNK> festival of new european cinema where villa paranoia picked up three more <UNK> best film professional jury best film audience prize and best film of another youth jury composed of <UNK> french high school students five <UNK> in a single weekend not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors in addition villa was awarded the grand <UNK> the maverick spirit award at san jose california just a week ago by distinguished british actor sir ben kingsley <UNK> making for a grand total of six <UNK> in a single week if lars van trier has put <UNK> on the offbeat oddball dogma cinematic map in recent years there is now a good chance that veteran maverick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that <UNK> has more to offer than <UNK> drivel which is to say a mass audience <UNK> for young and old alike moreover the female lead of his film <UNK> <UNK> has such a magical screen presence that with a little more exposure she stands a good chance of becoming the next international <UNK> <UNK> for the record villa paranoia is a fiction film written directed and acted in by mr <UNK> and <UNK> certain <UNK> from <UNK> the imaginary <UNK> anna <UNK> an ambitious young actress has lost a deeply <UNK> role in the <UNK> play and reduced to making an utterly stupid tv chicken commercial is on the verge of suicide however <UNK> <UNK> who runs a massive chicken farm <UNK> the spot offers her a job with room and board taking care of his <UNK> <UNK> wheel chair ridden father <UNK> who has not spoken a word since his wife stella committed suicide years before anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of <UNK> with the hostile silent old <UNK> and moreover discovers that he has been <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all these years a living <UNK> <UNK> this will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to <UNK> the dark secret which led to <UNK> total <UNK> from life and reality villa paradise paranoia true to the <UNK> tradition from which it is partially derived is a heartwarming multi layered serial comic psycho drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to <UNK> the kind of general international <UNK> it richly deserves alex <UNK> paris 21 march 2005
<START> i read the book and the book was fascinating br br this movie it's direction the screenplay and the acting were totally <UNK> i <UNK> at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel a novel that has all the action simplicity and courage to illustrate a <UNK> of a great possibly fact based story br br i can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know br br simply one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth br br the cinematography was indeed the only highlight but how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as <UNK> br br to <UNK> viewers do not waste your time or energy on this flop
<START> i remember when this film was up for the academy awards and did not win in any category for the life of me i cannot remember what it was up against but one thing i can say it was one of the best movies i have ever seen and the fact that steven spielberg directed the film did not <UNK> me one bit br br essentially it is about a black woman's trials and <UNK> as she is growing up from a girl to a woman there are a lot of <UNK> that are disturbing and horrifying but all of them are needed to see how much this woman has put up with along the way we see other women who have had to put up with their <UNK> and walk with them to redemption whoopi goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie danny glover should have also gotten at least nominated for his role in this film br br and the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects <UNK> not like some <UNK> freak shows like the more recent beloved did i encourage anyone of any race to see this film 9 10
<START> i like this episode quite a bit ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was as has been stated the music is very good and it has a <UNK> that doesn't exist in all episodes br br but one major plot hole exists so wide you can drive a fleet of <UNK> through it it is established that the light doesn't work in the vault don't you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light <UNK> worked you'd think in pretty short order they would have <UNK> the <UNK> and so found the note granted this is tv <UNK> fiction and various holes will always be found but this seems much too glaring br br it really doesn't make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the death bed <UNK> goes on <UNK> apparently for days
<START> this movie starts out <UNK> with an early scene in which frank morgan <UNK> against gary <UNK> marriage to his daughter anita louise frank morgan playing an <UNK> gold <UNK> <UNK> complains to cooper about his perceived <UNK> at the hands of his family including his daughter anita louise i am a fan of all 3 actors frank morgan is to my mind a hollywood treasure cooper a legend and louise a very lovely versatile and under appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role i also have nothing against <UNK> wright and while not blessed with great range she usually delivers heart warming performances br br from a promising opening the story <UNK> downhill all the way to the end i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of <UNK> would be in laws the butler in such a <UNK> non smoking household would never just <UNK> walk away allowing cooper to continue smoking or <UNK> he would certainly supply him with some means of <UNK> of his ill timed cigarette moreover nobody with any common sense would <UNK> himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of <UNK> of it and finally nobody in his right mind <UNK> out a cigarette in a <UNK> and sticks it in his pocket this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and <UNK> it is a poor <UNK> ill conceived and filmed in a way that <UNK> <UNK> not laughter br br the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived nobody lets himself <UNK> a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his <UNK> that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny it's absurd stealing babies from <UNK> is a serious legal offense and that too is nothing to laugh about finally the scenes of <UNK> overly <UNK> neurotic attention to his <UNK> feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own <UNK> babies but to me they just seem tedious and slow the wardrobe and prop <UNK> went over the top in those scenes while <UNK> the script writer went to sleep br br the lines are just not in the script to generate humor they just miss on all <UNK> the laughs come not a mile a minute but more like a light year a minute the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera br br the scene that is totally wasted is when both of <UNK> love interests and their respective fathers are <UNK> up in the same hotel room together there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine but none of it was <UNK> br br in the end one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt predictably it is the anita louise character who gets <UNK> on her would be wedding night while it is not on camera that is her fate and it is not particularly funny even as a loose end she hadn't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic unlike <UNK> patrick say in my favorite wife consequently i was expecting perhaps hoping is a better word in the context of the film for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending too the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie's end really <UNK> the effect of the happy ending for cooper and wright br br i kept waiting for something to happen for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era and it never delivered a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here
<START> i must admit out of the <UNK> movie collection this has to be the one that i love the most as well as one other that i have also reviewed the story is something that really keeps you watching a lot of the <UNK> films have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it in pieces before production when you watch it all <UNK> around sex and who can get with how many different people come the end of the film and oh dear god never watch one of these films when someone pulls out a gun it does not work that it is almost laughable but you do not want to waste the energy to do so br br losing control is exactly as its name comes on the protagonist the leading character the wonderfully talented and beautiful <UNK> reed the control is the control a person has over their senses their body and feelings and one man changes everything for her makes her a different woman almost but the mirror is <UNK> at the same time this makes for a great film that i wish i had come up with first br br 10 10
<START> what a strangely wonderful if sometimes slight and <UNK> big budget fantasy this is takashi miike had already proved by the time he got to the great <UNK> war that he could <UNK> into other films aside from his supposed <UNK> of the crime <UNK> genre visitor q and <UNK> showed this the former great the latter lesser but here miike in his first and only co screen writing credit no less proves that he can deliver the goods on a post modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions and with it <UNK> of cgi creature effects and make up and an epic battle that is more like a festival than something out of lord of the rings the comparisons can be made far and wide to be sure and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki for the seemingly unique mixture of kids as big heroes power hungry <UNK> looking for the energy of the earth as the main source <UNK> as the greatest evil and many <UNK> defined <UNK> designed creatures or yokai of the title but there can also be comparisons made to star wars especially to the <UNK> battle in <UNK> and to the whole power play between good and evil with similar forces or to anime like samurai 7 or of course to <UNK> films and through all of these comparisons and even through the flaws or over reaching moments it's miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters br br here <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> the <UNK> kid who starts out sort of <UNK> and sensitive to things in the world but will become the hero in a world going into darkness the darkness is from an evil <UNK> who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched <UNK> in the human world and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures the <UNK> into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission to destroy and kill anything in their paths <UNK> gets as <UNK> up to fight <UNK> the <UNK> as the yokai once <UNK> main <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> kill <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> another great <UNK> steals <UNK> little <UNK> companion a <UNK> soon things come to a head in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories but can only be contained up to a point by miike and his crew i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in american circles this has creatures <UNK> including a one eyed <UNK> stand and a walking talking wall not to mention a turtle a fire <UNK> and a woman who became cursed by <UNK> so the variety is on high on that end and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects which grows to <UNK> heights when the festival hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope but there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark and <UNK> becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike's <UNK> and not just because it's <UNK> <UNK> where else to get an audience <UNK> up than over a little <UNK> ball of fury who ends up in a tragic battle with <UNK> in robot form br br yet through all of this the sense of <UNK> that can be found in the <UNK> spots of miike's career is here as well which <UNK> it from its animated muppet and sci fi counterparts there's the bizarre humor as usual including a song dedicated to <UNK> <UNK> at a crucial moment in the climax and more than a few <UNK> of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes i loved for example the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller or the anxious turtle yokai the biggest danger with miike's access to bigger special effects and computer <UNK> which he <UNK> with is <UNK> on this end he's got everything down i'm sure with <UNK> and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions one of them is when all is said and done and <UNK> and the <UNK> human character are in the middle of the tokyo <UNK> in an <UNK> shot but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots and the interplay <UNK> on being too flamboyant and some visuals like the <UNK> of the yokai <UNK> the word about the big festival on the map just seem weak and pat i almost wondered if miike might <UNK> into bad spy kids territory quite frankly br br but this <UNK> aside the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement goofy thrills and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies it owes a lot to cinema as well as traditional japanese <UNK> but the <UNK> are always turning even in its most ludicrous and <UNK> confusing beats it's not the filmmaker at his very best but working in <UNK> in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage it's got a neat little message and lots of cool adventure 7 5 10
<START> the author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern <UNK> industry because he believes that the completely and deservedly forgotten movie bright <UNK> is about an <UNK> of his its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self indulgent <UNK> home movie suitable for screening at the director's drunken family <UNK> but certainly not for commercial or even non commercial release a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his her immediate circles avoid at all costs
<START> my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots so i try to seek out movies that have robots and this movie has robots big ones they beat the <UNK> and bang out of each other with the fate of nations hanging in the balance it's really cool you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of <UNK> were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget it is very hard to dislike this movie because of those big robots they looked like transformers and they fought like pro <UNK> it made my girlfriend smile and that is good enough for me and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul <UNK> as the <UNK> russian villain whether he is <UNK> <UNK> on his helpless opponents after they've already <UNK> or complaining that their close <UNK> to him in a bar has caused his <UNK> to taste like blood a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub bela lugosi accent he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on screen this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation
<START> the first in the series was brilliant easily one of the best horror films of all time this is the <UNK> when i sat down to watch this i was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones boy was i wrong incredibly wrong br br when i watched the first ten minutes of it i was actually really tempted to turn it off but i thought no maybe it'll improve it didn't br br not only is this just a dire film by itself it didn't need another sequel because the last two fourth and fifth had already been terrible enough also how many times can you bring freddy back the acting in it was terrible the story line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well the way they made <UNK> was just totally wrong pays no respect to the first one at all to add to this the whole thing seemed really over the top br br some people are saying that this film was funny this film is not funny at all since when is freddy krueger supposed to be funny i would call it <UNK> crap this film is supposed to be a horror film not a comedy if freddy had a daughter wouldn't that information have <UNK> like in the first one the ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy exactly like the rest of it this one completely destroys the essence and <UNK> of the first one just shows itself up br br such a shame that wes craven created something so good in the beginning yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin they shouldn't have even bothered making this film nor any of the other sequels except the third one the third one's the only decent one out of all the sequels br br if this was a dvd by itself and not part of the nightmare on elm street dvd set that i got i would have <UNK> it out when i got it br br summary a pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel br br a complete mockery of the first film br br so please don't waste your time on this worthless junk
<START> sequel to the kingdom is <UNK> and even more twisted i only saw half i was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1 2 hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder <UNK> mutated babies voodoo this has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you br br also you don't have to see part 1 to understand this you'll figure it out br br does anyone know if kingdom 1 and 2 are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is <UNK> br br sadly there probably won't be a kingdom 3 <UNK> hugo <UNK> <UNK> died a year after this was filmed but you never know
<START> pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the <UNK> of <UNK> and addition of <UNK> was bad <UNK> really doesn't have much to say or do and unlike <UNK> offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get <UNK> over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans oh well maybe the next one will be better cant <UNK> t much worse
<START> first off i really loved henry fool which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers parker posey is one of best actresses on screen today but this film was a full out travesty watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras so full of pride and making pointless <UNK> to star wars was stomach turning this was hype on the producers part <UNK> realized to the max a true example of the emperor and his new clothes mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever i don't think i can ever see it again in it's pure innocent light br br remember hal you can fool some of the people some of the time etc the director would be nowhere today if all he did was <UNK> out meaningless garbage sadly it's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation the story must be exciting and active or its box office hopes are dim indeed never mind a decent story for the actors it was like trying to act in a <UNK> br br the score i believe hartley's is tasteless with drum hits walking all over dialog there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile br br when i saw the trailer i thought oh they're just trying to grab a new audience but it's really this ridiculous ride i'd be happy to spoil this movie for you but it's been done it's rotten the fool franchise is dead long live henry fool
<START> <UNK> is truly one of the worst tv mini series ever made on this planet br br the acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense just two examples <UNK> was shown as a village of three houses instead it was a major city at this time it's best days already passed by secondly <UNK> would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the <UNK> sea <UNK> had no access to the <UNK> sea the major town at that time was <UNK> br br but worse than all that the directing how can a <UNK> like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this impossible there was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and i could not <UNK> laughter at most stern scenes br br i can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
<START> this was the best movie i've ever seen about <UNK> it hit the exact spot of what <UNK> is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and <UNK> it showed how people with <UNK> tend to think about things such as their <UNK> on life friends and themselves the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with <UNK> is is when beth says it's not about you that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem it showed that people with <UNK> don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else it has to do with them and them only it shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the most
<START> one may ask why the characters <UNK> yell and chew the scenery without any <UNK> reason except someone wanted to make a movie in <UNK> <UNK> baldwin is that the right one is forgettable in the cop estranged husband loving father of cute little blond girl role the story seems to have been cut and <UNK> from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years ellen <UNK> lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in her true acting range is displayed when she takes her <UNK> off as the movies <UNK> from one limp chase scene to another unfortunately the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody it is all just cliché familiar in every respect the director cast his own daughter as the <UNK> brat probably because no respectable agent would have <UNK> a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame contrived and uninteresting movie the only heist here is the <UNK> of the <UNK> money and the viewer's time
<START> this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly <UNK> back for the attack br br so this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight
<START> i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the 70's decide to give it another try they start by playing some <UNK> in some seedy european <UNK> with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
<START> i'll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda <UNK> has <UNK> that she can act as she was a high point of 'the whole nine <UNK> so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the <UNK> part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how <UNK> the production quality is and if you find <UNK> jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can't get off your <UNK> thats your choice my inner child <UNK> died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a 3 out of ten because as a movie it really does stink
<START> i loved this flick when it came out in the 80's and still do i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir ron <UNK> was hot and very funny although it was underrated and <UNK> by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out if you like <UNK> out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic it is military humor at it's best and worse rent it if you can't own it
<START> i wondered why i didn't like peggy sue got married more than i did when it first came out in 1986 with all the hype somehow i found <UNK> <UNK> character off putting way off putting then the plot didn't seem to make sense then by the end of the credits the question came to mind what point was this movie making what was it saying the answer unfortunately was not much if anything i really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the <UNK> and not the hole not a very profound statement and i'm sorry not profoundly made in this movie the writing simply isn't that good the direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times kathleen turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make br br she also finally <UNK> up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn't enjoy this movie more she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle <UNK> direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid his voice was annoying <UNK> and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy i understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own <UNK> for future failure but he goes overboard the way he does it is <UNK> not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the man we would have had a more enjoyable film cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice <UNK> in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected put on scenes br br the movie doesn't aim for a statement doesn't make a point is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time given all this kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this <UNK> mess of a movie i can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes believe me you will miss nothing <UNK> by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense br br kathleen turner is getting a lot of <UNK> from critics regarding her cage comments which proves that she's strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people's comments you go turner i'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress but her <UNK> is refreshing <UNK> acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn't work at least in this film now we know why
<START> this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts and undoubtedly christine <UNK> best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than <UNK> from it we listen to <UNK> sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we don't tire of her voice and partly because it <UNK> so well with the <UNK> antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty <UNK> role in the marx <UNK> a night at the opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera and <UNK> perhaps more in other performances than here <UNK> a comedic talent of her own that <UNK> never did the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> singing and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars
<START> my observations <UNK> hilarity tom drake and grandpa from meet me in st louis two years later the year i was born donna reed charming and pretty margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in wizard of oz spring <UNK> way <UNK> also with the <UNK> <UNK> small nose lacked by hamilton <UNK> scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious as a two year veteran of army <UNK> he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his eyes br br i used to work in a department store and it was just as elegant as this one sadly it has disappeared and faded into obscurity we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure <UNK> into the store to get them to buy all of that wonderful <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er <UNK> genre the plot has a writer returning to paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had <UNK> he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best <UNK> the french government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a <UNK> suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead <UNK> matters is the return of the <UNK> so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not br br okay thriller is much too <UNK> to be fully enjoyed there are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections the acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people i know only remember the top <UNK> killer he's the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour i think the reason that this film was rarely seen on tv was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it as good as the talk is i just wished someone would do something when it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late br br take a pass
<START> cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is treated <UNK> by her wicked stepmother and <UNK> one day a ball is to be held in honor of the prince but cinderella has no chance of going because her stepmother and <UNK> won't let her with the help of her fairy <UNK> and her animal friends she is off to the ball with the warning to return home by midnight at the ball she meets the handsome prince charming when the clock strikes midnight she runs home leaving behind one of her glass <UNK> with the help of her animal friends her true identity is revealed she and the prince later get married and they live happily ever after br br cinderella released <UNK> years ago was a huge box office success and it continues to charm audiences to this day it has a well written script the characters are memorable the songs including a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and the great <UNK> <UNK> boo help tell the story this was my favorite movie growing up and it hasn't lost any of its charm a true disney masterpiece recommended 10 10 p s the recent dvd release is the best way to appreciate this film including <UNK> deleted scenes music video vintage radio programs and a restored print of the movie
<START> this is one of those feel good saturday afternoon movies it's right up there with other retro flicks like flight of the <UNK> just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to <UNK> things up and it's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like kelly preston and <UNK> thompson not to mention <UNK> phoenix br br i personally really like movies like this from time to time nothing too deep or too scary just a nice story line and i would have never known mr phoenix had i not recently read the credits he was just a baby really when he made this movie br br kelly preston was quite the young budding actress then too she and <UNK> did a wonderful job in this movie i agree it's not an oscar caliber movie but very much worth watching especially if you have kids in the let's say 8 to 11 year old range or ones that are interested in the space program
<START> lame movie completely uninteresting no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black <UNK> down the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad <UNK> they manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies the scene where <UNK> grabs the family's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty it just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruel br br some subplots weren't even explored they were just used as filler why does <UNK> get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps <UNK> <UNK> at crime scenes why and on what grounds is the bad <UNK> guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief why can <UNK> pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian <UNK> and then just let them <UNK> out of there without so much as a slap on the <UNK> for some reason even though ford is <UNK> as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a <UNK> he makes up the <UNK> when he is trying to sell the <UNK> house to jack up his own <UNK> they keep coming back to him anyway they knew he <UNK> to both of them yet there they were coming to terms that both said they would never go for stupid just stupid this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire <UNK> on public streets with no care in the world for innocent <UNK> there they were just standing on the sidewalk <UNK> away while people <UNK> for cover amazing that they didn't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each br br the <UNK> was terrible the action sequences were boring the plot just a <UNK> to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and <UNK> it fails miserably and ford's phone turn the damn thing off how many times could it ring in a 2 hour movie 50 60 it was <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> in the movie every 30 seconds that stupid tune would play and if it wasn't ford's then <UNK> was <UNK> it was incredibly annoying br br complete waste of time ford's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights which was without a doubt the lowest point of his distinguished career
<START> a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50's and that he now has the power to burst into flames br br i was really <UNK> up for this film what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad <UNK> unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual with violent powers movie spontaneous <UNK> has an interesting premise behind it unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and <UNK> its plot too much the special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale br br the cast isn't bad <UNK> does steal the show br br all around no classic but it's not the worst of its kind either br br out of
<START> i was around 7 when i saw this movie first it wasn't so special then but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun a lot br br i think the best parts of the film are <UNK> body language and the <UNK> effects ' also br br if you wanna watch this movie don't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster even this film was made from <UNK> 1000 dollars br br i've a copy of it movie and video version as well but i don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas br br watch it enjoy it yeti for ever
<START> i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies hey no one wants to get <UNK> but danny glover brenda <UNK> happy birthday brenda and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the <UNK> is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain <UNK> <UNK> examples of high <UNK> are the various sci fi movies from the <UNK> if these movies had some political <UNK> or at least offered us a new look at life then they would be ok this one is just pointless far closer to diabolical than <UNK> also starring tony <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and matthew <UNK> and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their <UNK>
<START> i was initially forced to attend by my wife as she is fascinated by the royal families of britain and their history and she won't go to the cinema without me although viewers shouldn't expect to be <UNK> this film is very well made and the visual aspect is second to none in many ways it helps <UNK> the myth that victoria was the miserable <UNK> <UNK> woman usually seen in photographs she was a bright intelligent and according to the history of her early years a fun loving happy young woman her love of albert was the essence of true love and even if you only count the number of children she bore 9 they must have had a passionate relationship all of this is well <UNK> out in the film to this end the cast has been well selected with both emily blunt and rupert friend giving sound performances as victoria and albert br br spoiler alert the historical accuracy is somewhat questionable as at no time did prince albert get shot while defending victoria there was at least one assassination attempt when they were out together but nobody was struck by the shot s i also found it odd that little was done to expand on the allegedly intimate relationship between victoria's mother and sir john <UNK> it is quite likely that this relationship was the true reason for victoria's <UNK> for both her mother and <UNK> i also found it odd that there was an attempt to portray the relationship between victoria and lord melbourne as <UNK> on the romantic or at least having the potential to become romantic he was already in his late 50's when victoria came to the throne and while <UNK> between older men and young women were common in that era the movie portrays melbourne as being a dashing 30 something and rival to prince albert there were apparently rivals to albert but she could never have married even slightly below her station in life and albert was one of only a handful who would have been acceptable in any case br br all in all i have spent worse times at the cinema and <UNK> points with my wife can't be a bad thing either
<START> dragon fighter is the first sci fi channel although i guess it's now called <UNK> original movie i have ever seen but i have seen one or two others since and i can tell you that they were stupid but this one really <UNK> the bottom of the barrel the cgi is done poorly the acting is bad the script is ridiculous and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place if you have seen dragon fighter you probably know what i mean i didn't want to put a spoiler in my review plus there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence that was really stupid they just played it over and over and it's definitely not original i know i've heard that somewhere before i just can't remember where this is one to avoid
<START> i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed the word <UNK> says it all a body part nothing shocking here i could say to my doctor my left arm has been hurting a bit after <UNK> or my <UNK> hurts after <UNK> with equal or more social commentary it could be the <UNK> monologues for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard the monologues were dull but delivered with drama the topics were outdated and i was alternately bored and annoyed once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn't when i was supposed to surely this isn't really a hit oh and spoilers there was a lesbian oh wait maybe not come to think of it and inappropriate <UNK> and a crack mama that about covers it
<START> from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life the idea of two giant robots <UNK> by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script let's just just say it <UNK> to both lord of rings pictures combined the academy had a grave <UNK> in not celebrating the joy that is robot <UNK>
<START> who doesn't know <UNK> <UNK> in the france <UNK> <UNK> trio the three countries where the french <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> published 18 years after the <UNK> of the first comic book which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels it had to be adapted on screens after a first and failed attempt with a tv show the real thing begins br br first of all and that's what most of the fans didn't get the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series some essential parts characters and actions of the original are missing the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series as a 1st class fan of the comic book i must confess i was nicely surprised the actors are good so is the scenario though it might seem too fast i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial political thrillers but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet
<START> my children watch the show everyday that its on its a great program for younger children however they need to stop showing re runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of <UNK> and <UNK> yellow teeth moe is the only <UNK> <UNK> with clean white <UNK> teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at and one other thing if we might be able to add moe you need to stop hiding so much sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope what does that <UNK> other then getting wet all the time they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same <UNK> same <UNK> kids loose interest that way
<START> when i found this film in my local <UNK> i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of the lost boys 1987 to my surprise to die for is a really good movie it's a little bit corny at times but still there are enough stylish set pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire <UNK> this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times highly recommended
<START> most people miss hollywood's point of concept if a hero can <UNK> heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i <UNK> of the lessons being taught by doc savage br br in all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to <UNK> the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman <UNK> and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the <UNK> of the <UNK> before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old my mom bought it at our local <UNK> because it was on sale for 5 on vhs she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could a movie about santa <UNK> scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his <UNK> pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas that's right satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa <UNK> pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesn't make it back to his home in space he turns to <UNK> don't get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and <UNK> dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy
<START> first of all i loved bruce <UNK> music score very lyrical and this alone added to the film's charm the best aspect of the movie were the three animals <UNK> voiced by michael j fox sally field and the late don <UNK> whereas fox has the funniest lines <UNK> plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character the voice of reason and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off the humans weren't as engaging and sometimes the film dragged but that is my only complaint this is one beautiful looking film with beautiful close up shots of canada i believe although the film itself is quite long there is never a seriously dull moment and this is <UNK> by the voice work and a well written script all in all a charming and perhaps underrated film with a 9 10 from me <UNK> cox
<START> what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the <UNK> br br the title of this movie didn't catch my eye it was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all <UNK> filmmakers
<START> <UNK> clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see a highly faithful adaptation of john j <UNK> novel which had a <UNK> real scenario in the novel is made even more so here br br despite being made for tv this is first rate entertainment the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of <UNK> and gives the best performance of his career to date jane <UNK> is great her role as an <UNK> assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor daphne <UNK> is great as dr sanders and despite the character being a man in the book it works incredibly well robert <UNK> edward <UNK> robert <UNK> and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts <UNK> he letter br br there are changes to the story of course including and a slight change in the ending but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago they work fine sets are great especially cia <UNK> and the <UNK> office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work br br it doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel this will leave you breathless
<START> after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler <UNK> las vegas a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas midler who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's proves that she is still one of the most <UNK> live performers in the business from her opening number her classic friends where she <UNK> from the wings <UNK> a beautiful prop cloud bette <UNK> the stage with style and charisma from a rap <UNK> number called i look good she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she <UNK> her way through a variety of musical <UNK> the section of the show where she <UNK> <UNK> goes on a little too long but she does manage to <UNK> her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad <UNK> until she remembers it is hysterical bette also treats us to <UNK> turn from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club she brings the house down near the end with stay with me baby from the rose and her only 1 hit record wind beneath my wings from <UNK> it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans it's a must
<START> the story on the island <UNK> photographer bob who makes a photo shoot for a magazine meets the mysterious kathleen her free spirit and lust for life <UNK> bob who has suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before her life is not so simple as it seems however through kathleen bob gets <UNK> in a dangerous network will kathleen be able to win his trust br br review the dialogue in this movie is very natural and the story unfolds nicely although it stays a bit on the surface and it would have been nice if the character's <UNK> would have been worked out a little more why do these people do the things they do what <UNK> their choices this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view the story never reaches an emotional climax even though the characters go through enough to justify that so you don't get to know the characters on that deeper level the actors deliver good work and play in a very natural and <UNK> way but i think it would have suited the movie better if kathleen had been played by a younger actress as this character's <UNK> doesn't quite work for a grown up woman camera work is nice and there are some great shots of the nature on the island i give the movie a 7 10
<START> this movie was bad this movie was horrible the acting was bad the setting was unrealistic the story was absurd a <UNK> that appears once in <UNK> is set to appear one night most of the world's population decided to watch this <UNK> then the next morning everyone but a <UNK> few of people has been turned to dust from the <UNK> radiation people's clothes are still intact there are plants which are still alive but the people were turned to dust no bones nothing thats ridiculous how can radiation <UNK> people but leave their clothes and other <UNK> <UNK> intact br br even better the <UNK> mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a <UNK> child the insane clown <UNK> scare me more and they're supposed to look stupid br br then there were the survivors people who had been surrounded by steel when the <UNK> passed were <UNK> from zombie dom and death how can steel block a <UNK> radiation that supposedly <UNK> people in their tracks br br equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television br br the stupidest part of the movie however are the characters it focuses on two valley girls and <UNK> from star trek voyager these three characters were totally unrealistic who would go <UNK> the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere there were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie and most of them were dreams in between these scenes is <UNK> dialog which makes south park seem intelligent the silence in between the <UNK> dialog was painful i could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of <UNK> don't see this movie ever
<START> my title ought to be enough br br it <UNK> me that a culture so rich in literary excellence <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would <UNK> out such <UNK> as the <UNK> vague cinematic movement until the 20th century france had a great tradition of artistic <UNK> and clever philosophy but the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like <UNK> look how weird i can be plot theme <UNK> let's film an amusement park ride going round round at least this is not as bad as godard who has an <UNK> fascination with the backs of <UNK> heads oh la la <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> maintains a degree of visual clarity but so does the security camera at a <UNK> mart the two are <UNK> br br haha just as an aside to all you <UNK> film school <UNK> i bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now but don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review br br anyway if you like french literature you will hate this people who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the <UNK> of jack <UNK> or maybe <UNK> guide to the galaxy or maybe they have read the lyrics to the doors songs and they think that's profoundly moving whatever <UNK> <UNK> boat i find it ironic that this film <UNK> some weak <UNK> to <UNK> one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived nice try <UNK> but you're nowhere near the <UNK> br br avoid this film like an aids infected <UNK> br br if you're the type of person who likes to think then stick to jean <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> <UNK> and the japanese masters kurosawa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> br br if you're an idiot enjoy your <UNK> godard and andy <UNK> and for <UNK> sake push that vein back in your neck you look like a <UNK>
<START> this is hands down the worst movie of all time a combination of <UNK> goldberg the worst actress person in history and a talking dinosaur ala jar jar <UNK> add up to a painfully bad movie that was an understatement this movie is unwatchable for the love of god do not watch this movie
<START> i happened to spot this flick on the shelf under new releases and found the idea of a hip hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up that's how it was billed on the box anyhow and i thought to myself what a great idea plus there's a welcome to <UNK> sign on the cover too how could i resist unfortunately the hip hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme neither hip hop music nor hip hop culture had much of a role in the movie having lived in <UNK> myself i know that there are many aspiring hip hop artists there so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick why the <UNK> brothers didn't take advantage of this is beyond me br br once the film got rolling it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and latino you might think that this would put an unusual <UNK> on the movie but it didn't somehow the <UNK> brothers vision of urban culture <UNK> down to drive by shootings and dropping an f bomb in every line in the movie the rapid fire use of the word <UNK> is probably this movie's most <UNK> characteristics there were single lines that contained the word three or four times and no line didn't contain it at least once i'm not at all <UNK> about swearing in a movie but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers also the <UNK> brothers and the script was generally very poor br br the film was generally a disappointment it would have been interesting to see a genuinely urban culture zombie flick but hood of the living dead doesn't deliver on that count the characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or <UNK> or anything else there was no distinct flavor to the movie it's just another run of the mill low budget flick with bad acting lousy writing amateurish direction bland cinematography a cheap soundtrack and nothing at all to recommend it
<START> this was one scary movie br br brad pitt deserved an oscar for this br br a traveling novelist played by david duchovny of the x files fame and his girlfriend pick up two <UNK> <UNK> juliette lewis and brad pitt on their way to california br br on their way they stop at infamous serial killer murder scenes to photography the scenes for an upcoming book <UNK> character is working on little do they know that the most disturbed serial killer in the history of the country is sitting right next to them in the same car
<START> i had the <UNK> of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored <UNK> print in honor of the 20th <UNK> of the films release it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall <UNK> of this project cannot be <UNK> enough br br scarface is the remake of a classic <UNK> to <UNK> to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana in this version tony comes to america during the cuban boat people <UNK> wave in the late 1970s early 1980s tony and his <UNK> quickly get green cards by <UNK> a political figure in <UNK> city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction br br many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years robert <UNK> as tony's <UNK> frank lopez is wonderful his character is flawed by being too <UNK> and as tony quickly figures out soft <UNK> right hand omar <UNK> is portrayed by one of our greatest actors f murray abraham <UNK> <UNK> is the ultimate <UNK> and will do anything for frank it is like he does not have a mind of his own tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with <UNK> but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel <UNK> the <UNK> corrupt miami <UNK> detective played by harris <UNK> training day mel without guilt <UNK> great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to <UNK> as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel <UNK> it's your tree frank you're sitting in it ' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection br br tony's rise is <UNK> and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn after <UNK> frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough as tony <UNK> deeper into the world of drugs greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is <UNK> by an army from his <UNK> who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered this all <UNK> form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an <UNK> in a murder that would have involved the <UNK> wife and children br br all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture <UNK> does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the <UNK> moving three hour movies around the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever <UNK> on any viewers mind particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody <UNK> that ends the movie this is a highly recommended <UNK> done film that is not for the <UNK> or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels <UNK> let it all fly right here
<START> james cagney is best known for his tough characters and gangster roles but he has also played quite a lot <UNK> characters in his career this musical is one of them and it was the first but not the last musical movie cagney would star in br br cagney is even doing a bit of singing in this one and also quite an amount of dancing and it needs to be said that he was not bad at it he plays the role with a lot of confidence he apparently had some dancing jobs in his early life before his acting career started to take off big time so it actually isn't a weird thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career he obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are <UNK> to seeing him in br br the movie is directed by lloyd bacon who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre his earliest <UNK> musicals pretty much defined the musical genre and he also was responsible for genre movies such as <UNK> street his musicals were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really <UNK> musicals never were really about its singing this was something that more featured in <UNK> and later made musicals mainly from the mgm studios br br as usual it has a light and simple story set in the musical world that of course is also predictable and progresses in a formulaic way it nevertheless is a fun and simple story that also simply makes this an entertaining movies to watch so do the characters and actors that are portraying them sort of weird though that that the total plot line of the movie gets sort of abandoned toward the end of the movie when the movie only starts to consists out of musical number routines br br the musical moments toward the ending of the movie are also amusing and well done even though i'm not a too big fan of the genre itself once again the musical numbers also feature a young billy <UNK> he often played little boys babies mice and whatever more early on in his career including the movie musical gold <UNK> of 1933 of one year earlier br br a <UNK> early genre movie br br 8 10
<START> the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw 24 the speed things are happening is amazing and it's so surprising thrilling and even interesting it's almost as if you are reading a book once you start it it's very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking <UNK> to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside <UNK> i was sitting 6 40 hours which means 10 episodes sounds funny and crazy but i'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't stop this series is one of the best of it's kind and it's build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way
<START> in her autobiography <UNK> bacall reveals that <UNK> told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that at the time douglas sirk was labeled <UNK> for women actually he was restored to favor at least in europa after he stopped directing and when he filmed written on the wind sirk had only three movies to make <UNK> angels a time to love and a time to die his masterpiece imho and finally imitation of life 1960 then there was silence actually bacall and hudson characters do not interest sirk they are too straight too <UNK> dorothy malone who was some kind of substitute for his former german star <UNK> <UNK> and her brother robert stack provide the main interest of the plot a plot constructed continuously most of the movie being a long flashback the <UNK> of the brother and the sister from a family of rich <UNK> oil owners is brought to the <UNK> by <UNK> clothes and <UNK> cars that go at top speed in a <UNK> landscape <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the movie is stunning suit and <UNK> <UNK> with a small <UNK> she's ready for life the rebel is <UNK> now alone because she's lost hudson but anyway he was not in love with her this end is a bit <UNK> but melodrama is par excellence <UNK> three years later in imitation of life sarah jane susan <UNK> will be blamed because she does not know her place
<START> for shame for shame that a fine actor such as joseph <UNK> would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel the movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality the plot was there one seemed to go no where the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be <UNK> <UNK> and void for their pathetic performances i gave up about 3 4 of the way through and turned it off a 1 for awful only because there is nothing lower don't waste your time on this one you'll not miss anything
<START> first of all this movie is not a comedy unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh secondly the movie is slow and boring the acting is not bad but not special there is a lucky luke comic about two families one with big <UNK> and one with big ears fighting each other in a small town you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie <UNK> and <UNK> are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule there is a similar subject comedy <UNK> the home <UNK> this had some good moments my final comment is do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film
<START> i haven't seen the original but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to <UNK> down this far wicker man is the worst movie i've seen this year maybe even in two years i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it br br i'll give it two positive <UNK> the sarcasm of <UNK> character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful sorry that's it here come the <UNK> the movie's plot is only <UNK> forward because other characters won't give cage any straight answers and he puts up with this how this could go on for over an hour of my time much less days in the movie is beyond me br br not to mention that the plot is full of holes you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library how anyone could read this script and think yes people should pay 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like is beyond me br br do not go see this flick or even rent it on dvd
<START> much like the early horror film the <UNK> the <UNK> unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen although animal <UNK> stephen <UNK> obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest his performance is more comedy than horror br br the plot an extremely tired one has three sexy women bach <UNK> and lois young unable to find a hotel for the evening so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum <UNK> exceptionally played by the deceased sydney <UNK> if you have ever seen any horror film you know that lovable <UNK> sydney is a deranged psycho so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies br br the three women are all very attractive especially barbara bach but lois young a helen hunt clone is the only one to go nude as sydney watches her take a bath
<START> this was one of the most boring movies i've ever <UNK> i don't really know <UNK> just your run of the mill stories about guy who is about to get married and starts to fancy someone else instead story has been told a thousand times nothing new or innovative about it at all br br i don't really know what was wrong with this film most of the time when these kinds of actors actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before it's really entertaining there are usually little clever thing in them that aren't really in any other for some reason this one just doesn't hold your attention you can pick out some funny parts or clever ideas in it but for some reason they're just not funny nor clever in any <UNK> i wish i new how to explain it but i <UNK> just don't waste your time on this <UNK>
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the <UNK> the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can't say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it's impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while <UNK> bullets in a strip bar i'm not sure if it's supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film <UNK> <UNK> is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a <UNK> of laughable <UNK> and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this
<START> regardless of what personal opinion one may have of <UNK> <UNK> grotesque yet beautiful gem la <UNK> of 1975 one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience <UNK> erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to <UNK> film censors la <UNK> is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy tale like atmosphere quite explicit <UNK> and genuine weirdness that <UNK> refuses to take any compromise the fact that <UNK> of sorts is one of the film's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience br br pierre de <UNK> guy <UNK> the head of a french <UNK> family has arranged for his somewhat demented son <UNK> pierre <UNK> to marry lucy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family due to an old curse <UNK> uncle marcel <UNK> is strictly against the wedding when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lane and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings the story soon <UNK> into a bizarre sexual fever dream without giving away too much i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film as bizarre as it is la <UNK> is <UNK> also stunningly beautiful in style settings and cinematography the fever dream like atmosphere is present within and out of dream sequences the forest estate and the <UNK> family mansion are magnificent settings and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale the very explicit sexuality <UNK> from erotic elegant female nudity ravishing actresses to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting close ups on <UNK> <UNK> while having <UNK> in either case it is not likely to be forgotten the entire cast of la <UNK> is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters some of which are seriously demented the film <UNK> from an exceptionally beautiful cast be it <UNK> <UNK> in the lead <UNK> actress <UNK> lane who sadly died of aids in 1999 as the <UNK> in the dream sequences or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress <UNK> <UNK> who plays the <UNK> daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a <UNK> br br i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film the scenes with the eponymous <UNK> definitely being among them certainly not everybody's cup of tea but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema a true cult gem
<START> i saw this film opening weekend in australia <UNK> with an excellent cast of ledger <UNK> bloom <UNK> and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thin which doesn't inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from <UNK> in particular assured direction from jordan <UNK> his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of <UNK> to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it but i can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was he in what i suspect is a <UNK> to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the <UNK> just to please universal br br guess i will just have to content myself with peter <UNK> excellent secret history of the kelly gang 4 10
<START> its hard to make heads or <UNK> of this film unless you're well <UNK> and in the mood to mock don't view santa claus it mixes santa satan <UNK> and <UNK> in a most <UNK> way it certainly is not for <UNK> children
<START> scary but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn 70 i saw this as a late night re run in about 1976 and thought it would never end like <UNK> it's better than nothing but just br br ray <UNK> is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> looks as if she's <UNK> up all the beautiful downtown <UNK> brown br br it's a sort of roy rogers version of rosemary's baby this is one turkey that should never have been made if you have insomnia and it's 1 30 on saturday morning and there's nothing on but <UNK> of the 1972 roller <UNK> <UNK> then i guess it beats that but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment
<START> if the <UNK> of dr <UNK> is the father of all horror films and of german <UNK> cinema this pre wwi film is the grandfather the titular student starving in an empty <UNK> makes a deal with the devil the devil gives him a <UNK> sack of gold in exchange for anything in this room the devil chooses the <UNK> reflection in his mirror he walks off with the <UNK> <UNK> who commits crimes for which the student is blamed br br the film is marred by some limitations <UNK> out of the technically primitive state of <UNK> filmmaking the plot cries out for <UNK> effects but the film is of necessity virtually all shot in <UNK> daylight but the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a <UNK> br br more interesting for the <UNK> it <UNK> than for its own sake the student of <UNK> is still worthwhile
<START> most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate <UNK> remember the savage <UNK> but i'll make an exception for <UNK> which almost got it right br br here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad yes the <UNK> accent down here is way more <UNK> than southern the city of 1950 is shown the way it is was without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky <UNK> br br one of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot
<START> no there is another br br because every star wars fan had to have an opinion about i ii iii and because that opinion was biased since we missed so much the atmosphere and the characters of the original trilogy i will state the good points of the return of the jedi and a few <UNK> bad points of the prequel of course i loved the music the special effects the two <UNK> but this has been overly <UNK> elsewhere br br what we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie a strong <UNK> concern anti <UNK> positions fascinating insights about the jedi order and the force cute creatures harrison ford's smile a killer scene near the ending when vader looks <UNK> at his son and at the emperor the lightning of the lethal <UNK> reflected on his black helmet and when he grabs and betrays his master to save luke thereby <UNK> his own life oh boy br br what is wrong in the prequel <UNK> the whole human factor element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing the force seems to be more about <UNK> and <UNK> than about wisdom too many <UNK> at once and too many light <UNK> on the screen the lack of experience of a few actors too often threatens the <UNK> of the plot br br by the way if you enjoy the theory of the force as explained by <UNK> web <UNK> <UNK> i mean and <UNK> then you should read a few books about <UNK> and the forms it took in ancient japan br br the magic of star wars imho lies mainly in the continuing spiritual <UNK> from a master to his apprentice from a father to his son albeit the difficulties de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ton <UNK> from my soul to yours as would write <UNK> to the late <UNK> master t <UNK>
<START> when i first watched the show the first few episodes seemed promising bill <UNK> introduced himself as the stereotypical mysterious vampire and <UNK> presented herself as an independent woman however the show went downhill from here and the once interesting characters are as entertaining as a cardboard box br br as the story progresses the main characters lose their original personalities along with their acting abilities by episode 5 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are so low that his face just consists of a <UNK> <UNK> or rather the actress is even more dead than her vampire lover all these tragic events are surrounding her and she only <UNK> to how enjoyable it was losing her virginity personally i think they made the main characters sleep with each other too early in the show the way they <UNK> each other was something that had me hooked and could easily be <UNK> with a bit more as soon as <UNK> loses it she <UNK> around like a total <UNK> only thinking of <UNK> <UNK> and the size of his <UNK> bill also loses his <UNK> attitude and well he just gets plain silly his actions are never really explained except he does it for <UNK> why their love for each other is never <UNK> into if there is any love so far it just seems to be sex that is the core of their relationship br br yeah yeah vampires usually equal sex but come on every five seconds i see some sort of <UNK> going on it wasn't that much of a surprise since hbo always tries to pass of a soft core porno as a decent tv show bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with <UNK> with no reason what's so ever i laughed so hard i almost <UNK> myself br br the plot is just a stream of consciousness the characters never go into detail about anything all the events that happen are usually left unexplained the only thing that is constant is the sex br br the only thing i can say that i do like are the minor characters tara and her drunk mother are far more interesting than the major characters the only reason why i continue to watch the show is for the development of the minor characters br br minus the sex and the main characters the show would be much more worthwhile
<START> as i am not a blood and guts fan i found the gory scenes totally unnecessary you spell it and too real for my liking if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on <UNK> on the internet or snuff movies i say go for it it <UNK> belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though br br apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie the music was top class too through the movie and especially the end credits some parts though were a bit unbelievable like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any <UNK> or even some air <UNK> or a piece of <UNK> while he was at it come on now most would probably just scream hurry up and <UNK> me then lets get the f out of here quick where were the <UNK> <UNK> etc and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the <UNK> of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm <UNK> i would only recommend this movie to friends of dennis <UNK> and the like i'm sure a video like this would make <UNK> like that have a very happy christmas
<START> i can't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of <UNK> being <UNK> on it by some reviewers yes it's <UNK> down by an overly padded running time <UNK> editing and an <UNK> on <UNK> special effects and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch br br on the other hand it's also got some laugh out loud funny lines a talented and earnest cast and the classic underdog premise macy stiller and <UNK> are brilliant as the core team and <UNK> and <UNK> do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team i can't say <UNK> or mitchell added much to the film overall though each had a few chances to shine br br the plot as i said above is your classic underdog makes good stuff no surprises there since you know they're going to triumph what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd <UNK> heroes and villains but the dialogue and interplay between the characters underneath it all these people are children at heart who just want to do right the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional <UNK> look at <UNK> relationship with his long suffering mother <UNK> endearing innocence in his <UNK> to accept cap <UNK> secret identity <UNK> rage not unlike that one weird <UNK> kid you once knew who'd always go into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> desire to avenge her father this <UNK> belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the true appeal of super hero comics and underneath its <UNK> exterior mystery men shows us why these hackneyed comic book <UNK> matter to so many br br it never really <UNK> into a satisfying whole due to the huge number of half baked subplots romance family life conflicts within the team etc but the main plot is such <UNK> fun that it makes up for that the fact that it's supposed to be good nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here so i'll issue a <UNK> if you're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and <UNK> cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical am i to believe this is some sort of <UNK> magic <UNK> then you are far too literal minded and <UNK> for this film go rent a sandler film instead br br 7 10
<START> recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a <UNK> <UNK> itself from any co operation of real life persons that in itself is an eye <UNK> yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and i found myself <UNK> throughout due in no small way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialogue the film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who <UNK> composed together then <UNK> the film captures the essence of their lives and <UNK> in a story which <UNK> an explanation for their initial split what is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play faults and all that this viewer at least was left believing i was witnessing a true event in almost every detail the great skill of this play is that with <UNK> writing and fine acting a movie basically about two of us talking can make an excellent picture worthy of at least an 8 out of 10
<START> the movie lacks <UNK> with the <UNK> which didn't exist until the 1950s but no woman would do what was done here even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the spies but even if they had not they wouldn't have let one <UNK> around like this just to <UNK> the germans that the landing would be at <UNK> it isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work it is the <UNK> of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail bad directing bad scripts no attempt at authenticity at all all combine to just make the movie fall flat generally speaking spies should fade into the <UNK> the suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being <UNK> on this one that game was over from the start this spy was doing anything but <UNK> your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and <UNK> some suspense may be to read the book
<START> for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects watch this movie this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff
<START> this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously it is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable there are giant <UNK> that attack a girl oh and the <UNK> sing japanese it is amazingly bad and the ending which has been <UNK> throughout the entire film is <UNK> awesome predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat don't even give this film a chance and you will love it susan george is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant <UNK> they are the size of large cats this is a 2 but i love it as a movie my god but for entertainment i give it a 7 did i mention there are giant <UNK>
<START> <UNK> what can be said about <UNK> that hasn't already this is nothing but pure <UNK> from beginning to end if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing this is the perfect movie to get from <UNK> wild style <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> and it's four billion <UNK> ninjas everything about this film <UNK> of crap br br directed by robert <UNK> the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee's game of death he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent a few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well from buck <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done br br supposedly based on a book called the terrible game which if i could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it to see where this thing went wrong instead the book apparently is a <UNK> of <UNK> imagination probably something <UNK> made up in order to sell his lame idea br br pick this one up and <UNK> it for yourself it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen and that is saying quite a bit
<START> i don't have much to say about this movie it could have been a wonderful tour de force for peter sellers but it is one of the most tragic <UNK> in movie history that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more painful br br the terrible screenplay direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most <UNK> awful movies ever made br br i wish so much that i could find even a <UNK> or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of <UNK> <UNK> but it's a lifeless <UNK> disaster the truth hurts br br peter why couldn't you have stopped at being there
<START> this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here <UNK> it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't there br br
<START> from the <UNK> <UNK> of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy <UNK> <UNK> tells a lame disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures a babe and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci fi flick i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making d
<START> why did they make them so big why didn't they just give the money to the poor the question about <UNK> was asked by a student to mr harvey during a school field trip to <UNK> <UNK> that's a good question he <UNK> partly to inspire them to get them to look up with awe i'm not sure that <UNK> have that impact on everyone but this movie certainly had that impact on me it was awesome br br it didn't start out that way for a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of well a school field trip to <UNK> <UNK> if you've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it you have a group of largely <UNK> kids just happy to be out of school for a day the bus driver who's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control been there done that got the t shirt was my initial reaction i figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of <UNK> students yawn but it turns out to be so much more timothy <UNK> was brilliant as mr harvey a <UNK> <UNK> teacher with a strange fascination for <UNK> over the course of the movie his story slowly comes out and becomes the <UNK> point of the story we also get introduced to some of the troubled students most notably helen also brilliantly played by <UNK> press who's into self <UNK> br br this isn't a religious movie but it includes some powerful <UNK> on religious themes when <UNK> colleague <UNK> played by ben miles says i don't care what anyone believes as long as they don't try to force it on anyone else harvey replies that isn't tolerance it's indifference which is in fact in my opinion what often passes for religious tolerance in our society there are scenes of <UNK> between various characters and the final scene of the movie was brilliant as harvey climbs back on the bus director <UNK> white has the camera slowly pan <UNK> so that the final shot is simply of the sky <UNK> back to <UNK> comment that the purpose of the <UNK> is to get people to look up in awe the <UNK> <UNK> its goal we look up into the universe in awe seeking something greater than ourselves however we choose to define it this is a very powerful and very inspiring movie 9 10
<START> i first read pearl s <UNK> splendid novel in my <UNK> grade history class and i enjoyed every thrilling page of it it was almost inevitable that hollywood would get hold of it and considering that it was made in <UNK> the results are excellent br br certain things have to be accepted in <UNK> there was no question of casting asian actors in a major hollywood film in a way this <UNK> the end product rather more interesting than if they had been able to use a more authentic looking cast br br with that <UNK> to overcome executive producer irving <UNK> and director sidney franklin among others took the trouble to hand pick a splendid and stellar cast paul muni plays wang lung muni was at the peak of his powers as an actor during this period and could very nearly play anything he put his mind to once you get past the makeup it's good but no one is going to really mistake him for a chinese man his performance has all the <UNK> of his best work br br then there is <UNK> rainer coming off an oscar win the previous year for her performance in the great <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> star was on the rise and she was given the <UNK> role of o <UNK> despite her lack of experience in hollywood her performance won her a second <UNK> oscar the first time in history that happened br br much criticism has been <UNK> at <UNK> performance and her oscar win here she has been called wooden and one note there is a small grain of truth in that however that being said all you need to do is go back to the book for rainer though not chinese played o <UNK> pretty much as buck wrote her it is in fact a splendid performance and one of the best <UNK> from book to screen i have ever witnessed br br as for the rest of the cast well this was mgm they had the biggest <UNK> of stars and character actors in hollywood at the time and a big budget to pay for the best and in the end they got the best br br the film <UNK> wang <UNK> marriage to o <UNK> somewhat in the novel with wealth come the <UNK> of the flesh and he takes on a <UNK> a move which <UNK> his wife but her feelings as a mere woman do not concern him in the film a <UNK> wang lung returns to his wife on her <UNK> the two <UNK> he had taken from her years before realizing too late that she was his true love br br corny yes but that's hollywood considering the obstacles they were up against the film might well have opened to screams of laughter but despite the noticeable <UNK> of real <UNK> in the cast this film has worn surprisingly well with the passage of <UNK> three years in fact the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is when it might so easily have been a disaster
<START> this film is one of the finest american b movies of the 90s if you're looking for a serious film look elsewhere however if you're looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching everyone <UNK> the scenery a bit but that's really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john <UNK> have great chemistry and need to do another film together
<START> i was willing to go with the original cruel intentions it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories however this movie was in my opinion a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices i didn't honestly care what happened to any of them the strongest part of the original story les <UNK> not <UNK> is the characters and their interactions not the events themselves i wasn't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel especially since the title includes a number 2 i expected a sequel but then determined that it must be a companion piece over all i must say that this movie read to me at least like a soft porn version of les <UNK> i was not impressed
<START> i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare wasn't necessary the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name the fact that there is a bet and a whole lot of worm eating oh yeah i almost forgot the kid who <UNK> most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent how the kids know each other the number of kids involved how the bet came about the number of worms that must be eaten the time frame in which he has to eat the worms how they are <UNK> progression of friendships climax scenes etc nothing is the same but somehow it did not ruin the movie for me the characters are all enjoyable and the film did not leave me disappointed word of caution for parents there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room <UNK> draw their breath and that was when <UNK> little brother referred to his penis as a <UNK> dick the embarrassing part came when my daughter <UNK> to ask those sitting around us does anybody know what a <UNK> dick is lol that and an occasional shut up is as foul mouthed as this film gets my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 and was holding the empty <UNK> <UNK> just in case but was fine by worm 6 she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience
<START> i've been watching dick tracy for years and as a result it's become a vital part of my life it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often seeing it now as an adult it's still a very good movie dark <UNK> and incredibly misunderstood about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received other than that it is rarely discussed and didn't make much of a fuss when it came out br br pacino is over the top but to good effect as he's clearly having loads of fun beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly i have ever seen just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking the lighting <UNK> overtones and <UNK> smoke combine to create a great effect br br there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as <UNK> and i don't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting even the mandatory kid character is far better than expected br br overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5 7 10 average on imdb the <UNK> reviews are very positive check out <UNK> com and after seeing the film once again it's not hard to see why this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to <UNK> br br highly recommended 4 5 5 stars
<START> a woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enters a restaurant one morning at 35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the director writer's equally fascinating <UNK> it had a fairly catchy song it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short i'm glad that i stumbled across it wasn't aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friends br br my grade a
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is another one of disney's masterpieces it was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses <UNK> with the animations a similar concept was used in mary <UNK> when the children and mary disappear into the sidewalk art i am mainly rating this film through child's eyes because i have not seen it in years back then it was one of my favourite films it was magical and mystical and the last scenes the conflict beginning with the ghostly <UNK> walking into battle were my favourites there was also a lot of stop animation used with the spells ie people turning into <UNK> which may be a little dated and silly now also i believe that the film starts off slowly through the eyes of a child this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film it is an imaginative film which is sadly largely forgotten today
<START> whenever i hear a movie being <UNK> because it has no sex violence bad language special effects and so on my b s <UNK> goes off usually a movie like that is sentimental <UNK> which <UNK> to people who don't want anything to surprise them but to <UNK> how superior they are to us craven folk so when david lynch's the straight story began getting those kinds of reviews i was <UNK> especially since i was not a fan of his other uplifting story the elephant man for all the stunning images and the good acting in that film it seemed more interested in preaching to us than inspiring us br br i <UNK> have worried the straight story is an honest movie rather than a <UNK> one most of that is due to the fact that lynch and writers john roach and mary <UNK> tell it straight and simple for the most part there are a couple of <UNK> by straight i could have done without and the shots of grain being <UNK> are repeated a little too much but those are only <UNK> there's no heavy handed message no sentimental strings to jerk our emotions and no <UNK> towards us and its characters instead they depend on the story to build its own power and it does so by the final scene we are genuinely moved br br of course casting richard farnsworth adds realism to the part he really is someone who looks like he's lived through a lot but still <UNK> and except for those <UNK> the desire he has to get back together with his brother doesn't seem overly sentimental because you can sense here is someone who's lived too long and seen too much to be driven by anger for long and he knows his time is running out so he wants to make some peace not only with his brother but with his life sissy <UNK> also does fine <UNK> work as <UNK> daughter and although i am a city and suburban boy the <UNK> and <UNK> landscape are beautifully shot making me want at least to visit some day
<START> i noticed with some amusement that in the end credits the detroit <UNK> is <UNK> for their participation the chief of police even has one speaking line playing himself and boy can you tell he can't act the reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later not the kind of <UNK> i would think a police force would want other than that this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the <UNK> with a racial angle alex <UNK> is given a <UNK> role of a <UNK> cop that can't get ahead and is <UNK> with a mentally ill wife he makes up for this by hanging out at the local <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is his dashing partner that has a <UNK> wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a <UNK> the movie moves along until the <UNK> shootout that makes absolutely no sense why do people that are only guilty of a robbery take on a whole police force not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys we get to see four then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was seeing that director arthur marks was also behind the <UNK> friday foster and <UNK> i shouldn't have wondered
<START> i saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the cameo theater on south beach now the famous <UNK> night club it was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home it's got everything the generation gap the sexual revolution the quest for success and the conflict between following one's family traditions to those of seeking ones own way through life br br it was a fast paced highly enjoyable movie vegas was at it's <UNK> peak sin city in all it's glory beautiful women famous cameos laughs conflict romance and even a happy ending a very enjoyable time over all br br the poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall i look at it and i go back in time a time of my youth and my times with my dad a great time in my life
<START> i've always liked this john <UNK> film good script by <UNK> leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of <UNK> his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a <UNK> you can make a case that its the last good film roy <UNK> made i've always said that robert <UNK> gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but i really thought <UNK> stood out <UNK> may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic <UNK> thriller that shouldn't be forgotten
<START> i saw this film on true movies which automatically made me <UNK> but actually it was good why not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say i thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with <UNK> br br it's not <UNK> creek they're not <UNK> cool witty characters who <UNK> through sexuality with <UNK> knowledge they're kids and they act like kids would br br they're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but i don't think so <UNK> <UNK> gives when not trying to be cool a very believable performance and i loved him for it patricia arquette is whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers the combination of the two isn't exactly <UNK> on your <UNK> the plot was very predictable and but so what i believed them his stress and inability to cope her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together i think the characters acted by anyone else would indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't it reflects the <UNK> of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby i felt angry at her for that i felt angry at him for being such a child and for <UNK> her i felt it all br br in the end i loved it and would recommend it br br watch out for the scene where <UNK> <UNK> runs from the disastrous <UNK> session career performance
<START> very bad very very bad as a fellow who <UNK> to make be in or at least <UNK> the <UNK> table at a movie set i find it hard to criticize <UNK> who actually got a movie of any sort made however this movie oh dear br br realizing <UNK> doesn't <UNK> to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it <UNK> to more mainstream standards is a mistake and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much so i won't try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations br br 1 if gore is the point of the movie shouldn't you be able to see it br br 2 if you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment br br 3 in a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a <UNK> doll difficult i know but really br br 4 there is a lot of talented <UNK> in the buffalo rochester area most you can hire really cheap get one who knows how to frame a scene br br 5 just because you have someone who knows how to use after effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds br br 6 kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who's tops we want to see taken off br br 7 editing should help tell the story or set a mood at the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags a chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it's sloppy br br some good things not all the acting was bad jack was pretty good and i liked acid once she started fighting back there was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason acid <UNK> is a name that deserves a better movie i like the <UNK> of <UNK> too next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their <UNK> i hope all involve <UNK> to something better than colman francis <UNK> at least ed wood
<START> i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine i didn't know what to expect i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all it is very well done it doesn't focus on the <UNK> of anti war statements which to me left the politics out of it the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of <UNK> in their training in boot camp and how hard it was once they returned to <UNK> life it was really good to see paul <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war but <UNK> the command to go back when it was against personal morals make no mistake this is not an anti war film anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the <UNK> of war on their souls
<START> there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the <UNK> gate in the mouth of madness another carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the film's <UNK> the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from <UNK> hopefully no one will <UNK> this comment by <UNK> the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing <UNK> deep red claiming an homage would be a <UNK> cop out this was bottom of the barrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or <UNK> a time machine
<START> ok as far as the 2 versions of this movie there were 2 people involved in the making john <UNK> and bill <UNK> george was just the producer he really didn't have any kind of say so in the film just helped with money the <UNK> version was made possible by bill <UNK> john <UNK> didn't like or <UNK> this version as it was done behind his back thanks to <UNK> films going under they didn't <UNK> this movie and threw all their advertising cash for the right stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didn't so this movie never really had a chance when twice made it to cable hbo they showed the <UNK> with <UNK> version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the <UNK> version wasn't on for very long showtime got the <UNK> version the version on the <UNK> and laser disc is the version <UNK> by john who holds more power than bill it's a pity really as the <UNK> version is actually better and does make more sense but it's very <UNK> that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd or any other format short of <UNK> sorry to disappoint everyone i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club still have numerous items from the movie used to own a letter <UNK> version of the <UNK> version but it was stolen only have a partial hbo copy of it now 8 stars to the <UNK> version 5 to the <UNK> version any other questions just ask
<START> we see a body of dead girl in a <UNK> with the <UNK> trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they won't stay open after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they <UNK> up her past and found out some weird <UNK> so is she back from the grave seeking revenge br br oh what a great and always spooky story well that's what i hoping i could say and <UNK> was as good as it got this is an forgettable so so supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before but i went in thinking it was my first viewing so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things but like i said it's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again <UNK> is just another type of it's field that adds a <UNK> changes to the <UNK> oh please give me something that's a bit more fresh it doesn't have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired j horror flick even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed <UNK> an evil looking vengeful chick spirit br br but in spite of my <UNK> of it being the same old same old story and <UNK> this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality while the gloomy atmosphere <UNK> the audience with it's murky lighting the first scene involving the spirit <UNK> one of the girls is one blood <UNK> experience but really when it's not trying to shock you i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shut eye that might be harsh but it just didn't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self <UNK> bunch that you don't really care what happens to them the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship it just <UNK> its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it's just plain ludicrous the film's haunting ending is a high point though br br the film looks fine although it could have done without the <UNK> quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood the performances <UNK> a fine line but <UNK> <UNK> kim is strong in the lead role br br it's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills although i found the handling of it rather <UNK> despite the odd effective chills a standard effort all round i guess but still it's equally <UNK>
<START> warning spoilers ahead br br this short is part one of two that <UNK> upon the brief portion of the matrix in which <UNK> explains how the matrix came to be because we already know the story the plot itself is no surprise and the short isn't so much entertaining as informative but that's how it is presented as a file in the historical <UNK> the visuals are better than average and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short br br a couple problems the violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and combined with the occasional dose of political correctness un scenes <UNK> from the straight narrative of the short plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete br br the <UNK> concept is brilliant and despite a few issues this short still <UNK> its purpose it would not have fit in the original movie in style content or flow this is the perfect method to reveal the history br br bottom line good information could have been told a little better but still a solid 7 of 10
<START> julia roberts obviously makes a <UNK> effort to shake off her <UNK> <UNK> pretty woman persona with this <UNK> <UNK> abuse thriller but it's hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in <UNK> <UNK> based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it it's nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most <UNK> thing about it br br the plot has all the <UNK> of a late night made for cable and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are <UNK> out enough for you to really care br br ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying without <UNK> name above the title i'm sure it would have totally <UNK> deservedly
<START> this review is mostly all spoilers if you plan on enjoying this film don't read this review br br that's the problem with kids tv nowadays it's all so <UNK> and condescending wow that was fun wasn't it ' no it wasn't and unfortunately it seems to have <UNK> into children films as well and that is what <UNK> of the <UNK> is all about admittedly i haven't seen <UNK> of the <UNK> in a few years so i might be <UNK> on some points but i remember being thoroughly <UNK> with it at the time br br essentially the story follows a <UNK> who is given a book for christmas now the <UNK> is an <UNK> scientist on the flying <UNK> of some animal i think it was <UNK> anyway through this book mr <UNK> family man learns that <UNK> can fly in exactly the same way as <UNK> apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the north pole now if it were me i would have thrown the book out the nearest window flying <UNK> are a naturally occurring phenomenon but flying <UNK> is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept but mr <UNK> isn't me so i guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he's gone of course things go awry and before he knows it a flying <UNK> has crashed into his private plane and he's stranded at the north pole br br are you still following this good br br his family of course are <UNK> i would be too i mean what a suck <UNK> christmas elsewhere mr <UNK> finds himself in a hidden town at the north pole inhabited by <UNK> and one <UNK> figure who dresses only in red and white rather than try to escape immediately as i would have done he <UNK> everyone there with open arms this hidden civilization of midget monsters and he <UNK> them with open arms <UNK> <UNK> they feed him this story that they are the <UNK> of santa claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist and mr <UNK> accepts all this he even accepts that santa claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever there's just one problem they don't want him to leave the world can't know of their secret existence after all before they'd know it <UNK> be a <UNK> and a <UNK> on every street corner br br still with me br br now mr nice guy's family find the book and assume he's gone to the north pole boy wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he'd just gone for a <UNK> walk before the audience knows it they're <UNK> off to spend a christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet meanwhile mr <UNK> gets sick of all the <UNK> <UNK> and decides to leave i can't remember exactly but i do recall him holding santa claus to <UNK> a fire fight ensues when the <UNK> attack and he manages to escape via <UNK> <UNK> with santa hot on his heels and with <UNK> in his eyes mr whatever through some marvellous co <UNK> finds himself flying alongside his family's plane that is looking for him so he jumps on to their plane the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after br br the fact is there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that <UNK> charm they get away with it and it's that charm that is utterly devoid from <UNK> of the <UNK> there isn't much wrong with it nothing which insults the intelligence well obviously there is but it's a kids film and thus can get away with such things or anything particularly offensive but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either it just doesn't feel <UNK> and for a film that is all about christmas that it a pretty major flaw but hey i don't think <UNK> of the <UNK> target audience mind about that why should they they're all so <UNK> up on <UNK> they probably couldn't spell <UNK> br br i give it three out of ten if it was a tv movie then i'd add another two stars onto it we all know how bad they can get
<START> shannon lee the daughter of bruce lee delivers high kicking martial arts action in <UNK> in this <UNK> hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block there is high tech <UNK> to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action <UNK> of the next <UNK> adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to <UNK> up the already high action content of and now you're dead when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created i genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just <UNK> time until the first kung fu movies made their debut bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving <UNK> shannon does not let the family name down here although there are several pleasing performances in this movie michel wong for one it is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the <UNK> supreme hell you may well come away <UNK> her fights
<START> basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war but there were a couple things that struck me first was the use of mouthed <UNK> in two cases the scott character mouths one once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb off <UNK> and once when he is trying to <UNK> a <UNK> into being a pilot s t i could be wrong about the second instance but i <UNK> it several times and that's what it looks like to me the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the o'brien character goodbye and good luck give 'em hell over the <UNK> of the <UNK> she must have thought that was too <UNK> because she clearly says heck i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing specifically bombing civilians the <UNK> superior officer <UNK> him that only military targets will be hit due to the <UNK> of the <UNK> used given what we know about the <UNK> later <UNK> of <UNK> japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony i remember <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> in the fog of war something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal the ending is way overwrought in keeping with the movie it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat i'm not comparing the films just the ending maybe it's just 'cause he gets <UNK> up <UNK> up real good
<START> <UNK> <UNK> marlene <UNK> has spent most of her life caring for her father now that he has died she is free but doesn't know what she wants boris <UNK> charles boyer is a monk who has <UNK> a monastery to taste more of life they meet accidentally in <UNK> fall in love and get married but he can't leave his past behind and she can't live without him br br way overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations <UNK> and boyer do their best to give good performances but nobody could get away with some of their lines still in a way it is a classic it's shot in gorgeous technicolor try to see it on dvd where every frame is breath <UNK> beautiful <UNK> is always dressed to the <UNK> even in the middle of the desert and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body boyer just walks around looking stricken no shock there still i was never bored it was wonderful to look at and the non stop stupid dialogue kept me in <UNK> the end almost had me falling out of my chair because i was laughing so hard now i love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really this is unbelievable it also runs a very short 80 minutes br br as a camp classic i give this an 8 as a serious movie a 1
<START> <UNK> starts as <UNK> irish sea captain nolan richard harris his crew are trying to capture a great white shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine <UNK> called ken robert carradine comes under attack from it the shark is killed by a killer whale this raises <UNK> interest in killer <UNK> decides he <UNK> to catch one of them instead however while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female <UNK> it to the extent she <UNK> her unborn <UNK> on deck which makes a mess <UNK> her mate nolan orders the whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens the male killer whale is annoyed to say the least kills one of <UNK> crew before they reach the dry land of <UNK> in canada once there the killer whale <UNK> a series of attacks on the town it's people in an effort to lure nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death br br directed by michael anderson i thought this blatant rip off was terrible i'm sorry but i thought it was just plain ridiculous utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes the script by producer <UNK> <UNK> sergio <UNK> is so stupid i'm lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn't help if i have to listen to charlotte <UNK> go on about how intelligent killer <UNK> are just one more time i'll scream i'm sorry but i simply don't believe a killer whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to sink it i don't believe a killer whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil <UNK> from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there i don't believe a killer whale can identify someone's house know someone is in there then wreck it on purpose i don't believe a killer whale can move <UNK> around in order to trap a boat i don't believe killer <UNK> can physically <UNK> people i don't believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out maybe i'm being a bit harsh i mean it's only a film after all but it's a film which is trying to be serious things just got so ridiculous that i was half expecting the killer whale to write a letter to nolan to tell him his plan hand or should that be <UNK> deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else they should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold seriously that's a statement that's no more far fetched than anything else in this film i found the film very boring totally dull had awful character's with no on screen presence at all it goes without saying this is a jaws 1975 rip off which doesn't even come close to spielberg's classic br br director anderson is no spielberg that's for sure this <UNK> film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all all the attack scenes are as dull as <UNK> totally forgettable there's no build up to them virtually no pay off either as <UNK> doesn't get to eat a single person then there's the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the killer whale appearing to cry are pure comedy the opening scenes of the two killer <UNK> i suspect tried to show them as a <UNK> <UNK> couple but i couldn't help but think that this is the closest we'll ever get to killer whale porn hilarious stuff the footage of the killer <UNK> themselves is bland boring instead of footage which matches enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary <UNK> documentary footage that has little connection to anything else do you get the impression that i don't like this film good forget about any gore or decent deaths either there's a brief scene when bo derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you'll miss it br br this probably had quite a big budget it still sucks there's nothing outstanding about <UNK> it's well made i suppose but flat bland totally forgettable the cinematography is quite nice though the acting is bad <UNK> is awful the late <UNK> irish accent is embarrassing br br <UNK> is a lame jaws rip off which completely ignores or <UNK> up everything that made spielberg's film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as jaws the revenge 1987
<START> along with patrick <UNK> and robert <UNK> jack cassidy was an iconic columbo villain the very first proper episode of columbo following two <UNK> pilots murder by the book is not far off classic status br br jack cassidy plays ken franklin one half of a murder mystery writing <UNK> his partner jim is the talented one whereas ken has no talent other than the gift of the <UNK> and a skill for promoting the books as soon as jim has decided he no longer requires <UNK> marketing skills ken <UNK> a plot to kill jim except it's not a new plot it's actually the <UNK> in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books br br it doesn't take columbo long to work out that ken is the murderer although unfortunately another murder has to take place ken romances and then kills a key witness before columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction br br nothing whatsoever wrong with murder by the book but it's not quite top notch i would just give <UNK> or <UNK> the edge over this both episodes feature jack cassidy and the world of <UNK> but <UNK> or <UNK> is a <UNK> more tense and unpredictable but this is still a great episode
<START> a black guy fights and supposedly wins yeah 1 10 obviously fiction br br so we're presented with a <UNK> nice title a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line thats about it thats where it ends we move into fiction after that br br michael <UNK> white the black guy so don't get confused with the name portrays a black guy <UNK> thats all there is to the name br br its so hard to find decent help must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget low <UNK> of this movie has the <UNK> shadow <UNK> the first scenes yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me but yeah br br 10 lines review <UNK> if you paid to see this movie you got screwed
<START> this film like <UNK> royal wedding which was shown after it on turner classic network last night is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in gene kelly's record like fred astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a <UNK> walls and ceiling this film had gene kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with jerry mouse the sequence is nicely done what is forgotten is that kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to dean <UNK> and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day and sets the stage for the sequence by having <UNK> and the others shut their eyes and imagine a <UNK> type of background kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white <UNK> navy uniform with blue <UNK> on it jerry mouse does more than dance with gene he actually talks a first that he did not repeat for many decades he also finally puts tom cat into his proper place tom briefly appears as king <UNK> butler trying to cheer him with a <UNK> of <UNK> br br but the sequence of the cartoon with kelly took about seven minutes of the movie far more of this peculiar film is taken up with kelly's story of the lost four day <UNK> in hollywood and how kelly ends up meeting <UNK> grayson and with frank sinatra stalking jose iturbi at the mgm film studio the hollywood bowl and <UNK> own home except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing br br kelly has saved sinatra's life in the pacific and is getting a <UNK> as a result they are both among the <UNK> back in california who are getting a four day leave but the script writers to <UNK> what would be a short film kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one lola an unseen good time girl in hollywood <UNK> gene with frank br br it seems frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie <UNK> particularly musical comedies who are socially underdeveloped and in need of <UNK> about meeting girls or guys if the characters are women frank insists that gene help teach him how to get a girl just then a policeman takes them to <UNK> to help the cops with a little boy <UNK> who insists on joining the navy and won't give the cops his real name and address when a <UNK> kelly is able to get this information out of <UNK> by asking him some straight questions which the cops could not ask they insist kelly take the boy home to his aunt grayson still <UNK> kelly gets <UNK> with increasingly complicated problems mostly due to sinatra's simplistic soul view of things he misses seeing lola the next day by sleeping late sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up he keeps getting dragged back to <UNK> house as sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself but needs kelly to train him in love making br br i suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of anchors aweigh but i find this kind of story irritating while the singing and dancing and concert music of kelly sinatra grayson and iturbi are first rate it is annoying to have to take the <UNK> of someone like sinatra's character seriously in the real world kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day <UNK> what right has he to insist as sinatra does that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date that kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense br br the stalking of iturbi is likewise annoying kelly tries to get grayson to like sinatra when he says sinatra can get her a meeting with jose iturbi to audition her singing ability for much of the rest of the picture sinatra and kelly try to do that and keep <UNK> at one point for no really good reason grayson herself ruins kelly's attempt to get an interview at mgm with iturbi it is only sheer luck that iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed grayson that she does give him an audition of her talent br br kelly by the way ends up with grayson sinatra's conscience at not being able to help her see iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her but not pulling kelly into it oddly enough and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress pamela <UNK> from his native brooklyn and naturally without any assistance from kelly sinatra and <UNK> fall in love ah <UNK> <UNK> name is not <UNK> necessarily
<START> i had pleasure to watch the short film the cure by first time director ryan <UNK> what really impress me are the camera work and music br br i think many young filmmakers as i myself am one of them would experience hard time with cinematography when just start making of an indie we see the <UNK> are not exactly what we <UNK> or below our ambitions but this film directorial debut from a young director handled very well on screen the camera motion color lighting <UNK> all contribute to the story and emotion of the film br br and music as a key element of film language helps a great deal too br br it's hard to portray a woman's heart her desire her fear especially in a short but still i have to admit i am not a fan of v o narration especially when the film is advanced by narration instead of shots and cuts my personal feeling to some of the narrative part is my guess was the narrator tried a bit too hard so the energy pushes audience back from the emotion of the film br br overall it's a short film nicely done i could see the <UNK> from a director way to go ryan <UNK> from china looking forward to your next br br tim
<START> i just saw this movie yesterday i cannot believe the reviews on this site the ones that give it over one star must be buffy fanatics well i am a buffy fan of the first order but i know crap when i see it on every level this film is terrible technically much of the time you don't know where you are in this movie even within one scene it jumps <UNK> like crazy for no reason no logic whatsoever in cinematic terms emotionally is bleak for <UNK> sake and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing throwing nasty looking red <UNK> in your movie is a cheap way to convey atmosphere i ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act but i was having too much fun with my friends doing mst3k <UNK> to turn it off since leaving buffy <UNK> has had 2 successful movies if even listing scooby doo on your resume could count <UNK> is a fine actress but she or her agent sure can't find a vehicle for her and mr shepard if you are having trouble paying your <UNK> i'll send you a few bucks if you promise to not appear in a movie like this again also the estate of <UNK> <UNK> should sue for <UNK>
<START> it was all over with the slashers around <UNK> so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies the brain is well done the script reminded me of <UNK> but then in a more cheesy way as said before the acting can go through with it but it's the effects that makes you laugh the so called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown the opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of nightmare on elm street remember the <UNK> coming alive some how you keep watching this flick waiting what is happening next it's <UNK> for all freaks out there cause there isn't any gore in it and as said the blood isn't there neither but there is nudity for the <UNK> i have seen <UNK> movies than this one only wished they had made it <UNK>
<START> enjoyed viewing this film on tcm and watching a very young william powell philo vance playing detective just like he did with myrna loy in the thin man series back in the 1930's william powell played in the philo vance series and in this picture the famous veteran actress mary <UNK> <UNK> lake becomes one of the suspects in a murder suicide case where a man named archer <UNK> robert <UNK> is found dead and archer was in a room that was <UNK> from the inside ralph morgan raymond <UNK> <UNK> secretary gave a great supporting role and was the brother to frank morgan who appeared in the wizard of oz 1939 eugene palette detective sgt heath appeared in quite a few of these philo vance films and also gave a great performance in robin hood with errol flynn always remember the least likely actor could very well be the killer enjoy a great classic from the past
<START> i once thought that the stoned age was the worst film ever made i was wrong hobgoblins <UNK> it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldn't in the stoned age i hated the characters in hobgoblins i hated the actors and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity i won't include a <UNK> to this film i'm not that cruel i couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment in fact any discussion of plot <UNK> to this film is senseless and <UNK> words i would use to describe this film are as follows insipid <UNK> and <UNK> br br in conclusion please don't watch this film i beg of you from one movie lover to another no from one human being to another please for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it destroy any copies you come across
<START> believe me i like horror movies i like science fiction movies i like independent films and i like low budget b movies br br sometimes i even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines <UNK> situations and the like however i did not like christmas on mars br br it just doesn't work on so many levels for all the reasons listed previously and many more that includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female <UNK> and the many <UNK> to male <UNK> in a very <UNK> way br br i am convinced this is purely from <UNK> as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different i mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of <UNK> and focus <UNK> by modern audiences br br i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or <UNK> by the main character however sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen br br about the only kindness that i can express is that the image at the end was <UNK> if this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended br br to bad they didn't try that instead i just don't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made was it the plot surely it couldn't be was it the characters i doubt it i mean i could live without knowing about ed 15 was it the dialog <UNK> no the music perhaps but more likely the <UNK> ego of the principals needing to be <UNK> br br much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
<START> this film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly <UNK> on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the <UNK> away from the rest of the cast br br another problem is the <UNK> of the script with cliches the daughter who secretly drops out of college an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job and first ends up with fairly <UNK> work the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for <UNK> over substance the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these i e they are all firmly <UNK> in reality but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much <UNK> <UNK> and too few surprises
<START> on an overnight flight from los angeles to miami lisa <UNK> rachel mcadams meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die br br red eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats the premise is similar to <UNK> and phone booth but red eye is better than both of those films almost everything about red eye is above average including the suspense the acting and the direction most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie the film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots wes craven does a really good job behind the camera instead of focusing on the thrills he focuses on the story and the characters the movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that's not what the film is really about i also like the way wes craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on red eye really shows his skills at storytelling br br red eye also works well because of its young and talented cast rachel mcadams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate you may even end up cheering for her out loud cillian murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain the way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive the supporting actors are also pretty good which include brain cox and <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it the setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape overall the tone of the film is consistently creepy the screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though there are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head also the ending is disappointing it isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better since the movie focuses on the characters there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps if you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed in the end red eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer rating 8 10
<START> ok first of all this movie sucks but lets examine why the <UNK> that a machine is capable of <UNK> matter into energy <UNK> it and then <UNK> it and <UNK> it is at the least intriguing but that's as far as they take this premise instead of <UNK> into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine they break the damn thing this could have been a good premise living with the <UNK> of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation ie the invisible man but no they break the damn thing and <UNK> wants to leave so then the doctor jerry <UNK> the thing back together and <UNK> to transport himself only to have it <UNK> up by his beautiful but dumb secretary duh which wouldn't happened if <UNK> hadn't decided to leave so now he is <UNK> the country side killing people because his little experiment failed and they wouldn't give him money <UNK> then to make the movie worse throw in a dry british relationship between the two semi competent <UNK> hired to assist him between their loving sessions they make a couple of half hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of london all of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine which would never have happened if <UNK> hadn't left this movie tried so i give it an honest 2 stars for effort but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine making <UNK> leave making him try it again damn you <UNK>
<START> its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it i rate it right up there with christmas vacation the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the <UNK> plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money
<START> the idea <UNK> a very short film with a lot of information interesting entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen i have rated this film at the highest possible rating i also recommend that it is shown to office <UNK> and business people in any establishment what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to their voice is never heard it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this <UNK> i look forward to viewing the sequence once again <UNK> to <UNK> media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind
<START> banned as a <UNK> <UNK> in the uk unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of <UNK> however the most shocking thing i found about the film was its <UNK> in all <UNK> the <UNK> i could handle the terrible acting shoddy editing awful direction lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take br br three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a <UNK> during a storm they are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house the owner of the house a <UNK> old lady and her <UNK> daughter welcome the girls in allowing them to stay for a few days in order to <UNK> however someone doesn't want the girls to <UNK> one by one they fall victim to an unseen <UNK> br br taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film and that takes some doing unhinged is a truly awful film the music is a total mess it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a <UNK> and as such it <UNK> the movie perfectly only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save unhinged from getting the lowest possible score br br if you are a horror <UNK> and unfortunately i am you will want to see this in order to <UNK> it off the video nasty watch list but be <UNK> is really really bad
<START> a message movie but a rather good one outstanding cast top to bottom interesting in that bette <UNK> plot line is essentially back story the extremely negative reviews name throwing at the screenplay playwright <UNK> this somehow with extremely negative comments about <UNK> in <UNK> etc etc object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii gosh that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me br br theatrical and movie making and acting styles <UNK> over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way yes casablanca is a better movie i guess but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them casablanca is primarily a love story the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot more of a thriller both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
<START> i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s and it stayed with me it's charming loud colourful a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the <UNK> but no its wholesome clean fun br br jack wild is in fine form as is mama <UNK> and the somehow attractive <UNK> poo br br if you like the banana <UNK> and you are in your 30's this will re create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe br br even if i've realised now that <UNK> himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie if like me you are into death metal you'll love it
<START> this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get <UNK> nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you don't see names like robert <UNK> kevin <UNK> or tom <UNK> attached to the cover it isn't worth messing with for the most part the main action of <UNK> falls was taking place in <UNK> yet the <UNK> used were <UNK> models even the shooting was bad in one scene the <UNK> <UNK> his six <UNK> about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this <UNK> perhaps those who <UNK> in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting
<START> most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold true br br but if i have to sit through a movie were the br br director br br director of photography br br editor br br can't even miss the darn <UNK> boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i'm reminded of the <UNK> of making a movie br br wait for the dvd or don't bother
<START> match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member but <UNK> what i have known for years he shouldn't focus on neurotic rich new <UNK> in this case johansson plays <UNK> student sondra <UNK> whom magician sid <UNK> allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe <UNK> ian <UNK> who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter <UNK> hugh jackman so she gets to know him and well i don't know how much i can tell you without giving it away but i can say that this is probably allen's funniest movie in years there's his <UNK> unique style of humor especially the line about his religion br br so you're sure to like this movie if nothing else it'll make you fall in love with london but mostly it's just so damn hilarious even if you don't like woody allen you gotta love this one
<START> this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac 2007 and got this one by accident thought it was a joke before the actual movie this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer the filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings they only liked the name so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name i am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner i try to like something out of every movie i don't hate movies ever except this one if you could have given it no stars i definitely would have 1 out of 10
<START> back when alec baldwin and kim basinger were a <UNK> hot <UNK> high powered hollywood couple they filmed this nearly scene for scene remake of the 1972 steve mcqueen ali <UNK> action thriller about a fugitive <UNK> it almost worked the first time because mcqueen was such a vital presence on the screen even stone silent and weary you could sense his clock <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> baldwin is not in steve <UNK> league but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor if so this is not a showcase for his attributes basinger does well and certainly looks good but james woods is <UNK> hammy in a silly mob <UNK> role a sub plot involving another couple taken hostage by <UNK> ex partner was unbearable in the <UNK> film and plays even worse here as for the action scenes they're pretty old hat which causes one to wonder why even remake the original from
<START> if you are studying welles and want to see just how far he fell after citizen kane this film will prove it the cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self admitted <UNK> to explain how he might fall into such a half baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom <UNK> and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the <UNK> as i was all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welles and hayworth fans out there
<START> it's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad the acting is very average the story is horribly boring and i'm at a loss for words as to the execution it was completely unoriginal o and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood's a pregnant <UNK> br br one of the first scenes the one with the television show where the hell are you got it right the cast was 80 of let's face it forgotten actors if they were hoping for a career <UNK> then i think it might never happen with this on their <UNK> the script had the potential but neither 80 of the actors nor the director who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor pulled it off fred <UNK> was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest br br i'm sorry but if you ever consider watching this i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic because not only it's a total loss of time but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like
<START> this has always been one of my favourite movies and will always be over the last few years i have become a 50's 60's sci fi freak trying to collect all of the better ones that were made back then i love lots of things about them from how corny they could be to how technically correct some of them were the great colours and the sets get me going too it's a pity when they re make some of these good old movies they nearly always stuff it up just look at the recent re do of the day the earth stood still it's utter garbage forbidden planet is one of the <UNK> space films of all time and now they're trying to re make it too and i <UNK> to think what the new one will be like to my mind some things such as fantastic classic movies should just be left alone to be what they are classic examples of great attempts at telling simple stories and giving people a thrill in the process once they add all the <UNK> crap that we have available now the film just seems to be more dog meat from the hollywood <UNK> factory nothing special at all by the way i notice that the <UNK> uniforms in forbidden planet were also used for queen of outer space that just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then doesn't it hey less money and better films hmmm br br great performances in this movie from leslie <UNK> in a serious role and anne francis walter <UNK> who has always been one of my favourite actors earl <UNK> and of course <UNK> the robot br br the special effects are fantastic and the storyline is not too far fetched this is a great sci fi experience
<START> i really disliked this movie mainly because of the main characters they are both immature selfish and self centered people they hurt everybody around them playing their silly game the visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting am i supposed to be happy when these two psycho people finally <UNK> their love for each other br br after watching this movie i was thinking this is supposed be the 1 smash from france br br spoiler br br as for the end good <UNK> they both deserve each other br br
<START> revolt of the zombies starts with <UNK> <UNK> dean jagger trying to convince general <UNK> george cleveland that his mate <UNK> william <UNK> is a priest who has the power to <UNK> people render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies a bit like the people i work with really anyway <UNK> is murdered by colonel <UNK> roy <UNK> but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies an expedition has been set up by general <UNK> to hunt for the secret since <UNK> ain't going to tell them much anymore general <UNK> heads the expedition along with his daughter claire dorothy stone who is engaged to <UNK> who also comes along during the expedition claire <UNK> <UNK> for his mate <UNK> grayson robert <UNK> at which <UNK> isn't too pleased about in a way that could only happen in a film <UNK> finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire <UNK> co written directed by victor <UNK> revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation after watching it i can see why the script by <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> lloyd all uncredited has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull as exciting as watching paint dry nothing much happens for ages then nothing much happens afterwards either how <UNK> depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie these zombies are just <UNK> people <UNK> audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead 1968 at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago the black white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location the acting is wooden largely unimpressive revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it hasn't dated well in 2005 it's an absolute chore to sit through i believe the film is now public <UNK> as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd <UNK> budget <UNK> but it's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for
<START> i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed i generally like to see documentaries but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than <UNK> i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random <UNK> i also remember to have seen parts of the film on <UNK> stores running on the displayed high definition <UNK> after seeing the movie it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not br br without <UNK> a 10 out of 10 for sure there are more thrilling movies but in regard of documentaries <UNK> is definitely one of the best of it's genre
<START> where the hell are all these <UNK> islands where <UNK> monsters <UNK> evil doctors perform their experiments <UNK> hold the ultimate karate championship and the uber rich hunt humans for sport i had no idea there were still so many <UNK> islands out there but if you take into account the number of movies that <UNK> one of these mysterious islands as a location you'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these <UNK> out there it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately <UNK> points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is <UNK> experiments on one of these <UNK> islands so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began br br the island in this movie used to belong to dr <UNK> but has recently been purchased by the re animator himself jeffrey combs old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge <UNK> cell research which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer if that sounds familiar that's because this is roughly the same basic set up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea not to mention a host of other <UNK> image movies so apparently <UNK> son was dying of cancer which <UNK> our mad doctor to start <UNK> on his <UNK> he did some kind of super fancy gene <UNK> and so forth turning his son into a shark man br br william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments if someone would have given him a <UNK> hat william would have been a dead <UNK> for the <UNK> from <UNK> island in typical bond villain fashion the doctor decides that all of these <UNK> would make nice <UNK> for his son not <UNK> like buddies <UNK> like shark food so enter shark boy who starts stalking the <UNK> and his <UNK> all over the island they of course make half hearted attempts to escape and are <UNK> over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark man suit br br the movie didn't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those <UNK> deserted islands it's funny that this movie is called hammerhead it made me think of an old joke why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer because it feels so good when you stop that's pretty much how this movie is the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it's over
<START> george raft as steve <UNK> the <UNK> dancing <UNK> who can never refuse a dare is <UNK> against the <UNK> sentimental chuck <UNK> wallace <UNK> a soft touch for every <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> notably runaway orphan <UNK> jackie cooper complete with <UNK> and the homeless lucy <UNK> an out of town innocent with ambitions to become a writer br br in this male dominated culture communication takes place mostly in the form of violence one sees why the <UNK> is a martin scorsese favorite exploding <UNK> provide a running gag <UNK> enjoys throwing rocks through windows in <UNK> on one occasion setting a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> arrival of both <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fire companies leads to a <UNK> during which the building burns to the ground <UNK> casually <UNK> a <UNK> girl and <UNK> anyone who <UNK> with him including <UNK> whom he <UNK> in a night time fist fight on a <UNK> <UNK> to regain control of his saloon lost on a bet that <UNK> wouldn't have the courage to jump off the brooklyn bridge <UNK> does make the leap but only because a <UNK> with a <UNK> fails at the last moment br br as usual walsh fills the frame with detail <UNK> with <UNK> the daily life of the <UNK> singing <UNK> bullying <UNK> <UNK> from suicide hall being <UNK> into the black maria <UNK> <UNK> hapless <UNK> off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don't want a minor but admirable little film
<START> cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that i've ever seen br br not that they didn't try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting i'm not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrong br br some of the elements may have been bad structure and no <UNK> story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour <UNK> my hair out at about a hour and a half and very <UNK> at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an <UNK> about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was <UNK> that it <UNK> something that had nothing good to it that was <UNK> by the pretty 17 year old girl who was in love with the 30 year old <UNK> br br and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was <UNK> and <UNK> with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you've just not seen enough br br skip it i assumed that this was a first time director who was <UNK> by his own <UNK> but he has done this before i'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money
<START> garde <UNK> <UNK> has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub plots it contains if you're not used to french <UNK> films based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action don't even try to watch it you'll only obtain boredom to death and <UNK> opinion that french movies are not for you br br garde <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> film essentially based upon dialogs written by <UNK> by the way and it <UNK> cuts the <UNK> of appearances br br why does <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> prefer to be <UNK> accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8 years sexual relation his wife knows it she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in 1980 in france there was still death penalty rather than <UNK> the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life
<START> to me this was colin <UNK> best movie <UNK> he introduced himself to america through this movie and he was great he really got you into his <UNK> and made u feel the passion he was putting into his role in my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite
<START> a complete waste of time br br <UNK> <UNK> is a complete waste of time the script and dialogues are poorly written the direction is <UNK> and the acting borders on hammy this movie was clearly aiming for the <UNK> de <UNK> crowd but it falls far short of the mark because it does not have even one of the elements that made <UNK> connect with its audience great script terrific acting good direction and a powerful social message that was never <UNK> but shown br br compared to that near masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> takes a step backwards by <UNK> to scenes such as the hero taking a <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the hero's mentor staring down bullets in a truck no less all of this might have been acceptable in the 80s when there was a <UNK> in movie quality and bad movies like <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> became big hits but movie making has become should have become more subtle and thoughtful of late br br <UNK> <UNK> is a capable director and i appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every movie he makes but maybe he simply does not know how to do it he <UNK> to <UNK> without a care as to the audience's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say maybe he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br even if you don't agree with everything i say you will agree that throughout the screening you will be thinking that <UNK> de <UNK> was much much better and mr <UNK> should have left the industry bashing to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> industry bashing that's right <UNK> has depicted the industry as a place of back biting <UNK> and the casting couch which the hero happily <UNK> in with a <UNK> curiously named <UNK> there are some people who will think that these portions show the real face of the industry don't believe everything you see br br all in all raise your voice against movies like this and don't spend your hard earned money on this bomb br br out of
<START> in the '70s charlton heston starred in sci fi flicks of varying quality soylent green is one of the better ones he plays robert thorn a detective in <UNK> new york in this future most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called soylent green but when thorn finds out the <UNK> truth about this product he finds himself on the run br br i guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays but even so it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our <UNK> also starring leigh taylor young chuck <UNK> <UNK> peters joseph <UNK> and edward g robinson in his final role
<START> land of plenty is not a film it is a <UNK> for the directorial career of german director <UNK> <UNK> br br many felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has <UNK> lost it he's actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes br br one might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but <UNK> case is extreme it's as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get <UNK> results br br in a few words this film does not deserve your time
<START> national <UNK> class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80's which combines unique characters lots of laughs and some great music from chuck <UNK> when walter <UNK> is absolutely <UNK> by his classmates at their high school <UNK> he <UNK> the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl a horny fat guy the high school beauty the king of all <UNK> and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up <UNK> to all the kids during <UNK> this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i wouldn't recommend it for young children but it's a great movie for teens if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun and who doesn't then this movie should be on your movies to see list
<START> i thought they should have called this movie whites instead of heights <UNK> the kind of film that makes people hate new <UNK> people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so important give me a break such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal it and so they introduce get this a character even <UNK> than the rest of the cast i thought he was an <UNK> at first who's supposed to be <UNK> i'm still trying to <UNK> that accent intellectually <UNK> this movie is the kind of film that's able to fool so many people into thinking it's worthwhile because it has the <UNK> of something more ambitious better to fill the theaters with <UNK> 10 than with this pretentious crap must have been a better play because you can't fall off the floor
<START> and <UNK> joe go stuck in the water i die of <UNK> every time i see this movie and then a big brown shark came this is comedy at it's best this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else andrew <UNK> clay jerry tucker rock they can't <UNK> the man the myth the legend eddie murphy br br <UNK> eddie we want more br br more more more more more more
<START> as i reach the <UNK> of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today this film drives that point home to the core if you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film from kiss posters to an angel concert this movie rocks br br watch for a young laura dern why they didn't have more songs from the <UNK> i'll never know br br i did have a problem with randy <UNK> character <UNK> a 16 year old girl while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys <UNK> house the cops come and everything but no mention of all the <UNK> drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff br br <UNK> belongs right there with over the edge fast times <UNK> confused and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks br br i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all
<START> this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany br br i find the wooden horse <UNK> boring the subject could have been thrilling suspenseful and <UNK> <UNK> but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way it's a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and thrill the first half <UNK> tells how the prisoners of war <UNK> a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough <UNK> and close <UNK> to make me on edge the latter half of the film is even worse they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film i am disappointed by the wooden horse it wasted the potential to be a great film
<START> a truly truly dire canadian german co production the ever wonderful <UNK> arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter <UNK> the term problem child a few <UNK> prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the <UNK> now she's moved up to the <UNK> us to start over but her child still has a problem in that she's devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond br br unfortunately mandy <UNK> as the daughter murders more than people she delivers such a terrible performance that she also <UNK> out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music check out the <UNK> the first time she displays her bikini clad <UNK> don't help any we're supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely <UNK> and not even bad enough to be amusing not to mention the fact that arquette and <UNK> don't really convince as mother and daughter all <UNK> to miss arquette and <UNK> <UNK> both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom particularly <UNK> are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this <UNK> br br one of the production companies is called quality international films not since the three hour love lies and murder from two short productions has there been such a you must be joking credit
<START> the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same time br br i saw it and i was bored to death the <UNK> actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind the entire premise that so much money was given a team of <UNK> to solve murders dating back 10 20 30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely br br the time is also a factor as they only have 50 60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members if they are still alive this combined with the personal problems and relations of the <UNK> which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster br br i give it a 2 star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it which you then of course won't do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap
<START> i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival in a small 200 seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival br br i absolutely was into it i love the mix of <UNK> made fictional scenes it is amazing set design the scenes look really like they were filmed in <UNK> or <UNK> br br and the music is so nice br br i rate this experience 9 10 br br spoilers ahead br br the documentary tells about awesome blues men with black and white old looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing it is really amazing but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary it is the too <UNK> use of <UNK> to modern rock bands playing those blues songs in a modern way i didn't really appreciate their <UNK> way of playing such awesome blues songs this is the same kind of un perfect musical taste i found when watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> social club br br the documentary was such a standing <UNK> at this first screening in the little cinema that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the <UNK> at the open air cinema though the sand the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night
<START> this movie should be number one on the bottom 100 the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill and the story is worse i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to <UNK> review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet don't waste your time money energy or anything else on this movie thank goodness we saw it on tv so we didn't spend anything on it had we i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to <UNK> an <UNK> in their general direction in conclusion i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film don't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it
<START> don't you just hate it when you order <UNK> but the restaurant gives you chicken br br such is how i felt watching this so called battlestar galactica arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains it's not what the fans ordered br br imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip <UNK> which you loved when your meal arrives you find they've applied the name new york strip to a chicken dish you complain but the <UNK> merely states but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> really good <UNK> do you really care if the chicken is good you wanted new york strip a <UNK> the <UNK> then explains you <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chef wanted to to do as you <UNK> <UNK> new we felt <UNK> <UNK> would be more popular <UNK> we gave it the name of our previous delicious <UNK> you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called new york strip now on the menu you'll never see the original new york strip ever again br br such is the case with creating something new and <UNK> the battlestar galactica <UNK> on it br br this mini series is an <UNK> to all fans of the original show br br it's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original the team put in charge of <UNK> <UNK> should have loved the original series seeking to improve what the fans loved not try to shamelessly sell this new series by <UNK> the battlestar galactica name br br if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show then do so give it a new name don't use the name we <UNK> remember in an attempt to lure in viewers that effectively <UNK> us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future br br we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as <UNK> because we liked something about the original we didn't simply want the name and <UNK> of the basic concept there are things we loved about the original series br br sadly probably the best elements of the original were those which were <UNK> sure the original <UNK> was <UNK> and could have used some <UNK> this mini series however was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects which were good but not anything unusual by today's standards br br many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream br br that being said i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself not in comparison to the original br br the battle sequences were the best part effort was obviously put into making the effects more real in appearance and less wow look at that effect i would not say these sequences were exceptional by today's standards yet they were in keeping with made for cable original movies what was the deal with this pseudo live <UNK> some views tried to fake the effect of a real camera with <UNK> tracking and jerky <UNK> however it was over used considering there was no apparent source of these cameras the infinitely more intelligent series <UNK> 5 is the only instance i've seen such live <UNK> used effectively when we were supposedly witnessing action from security <UNK> br br the script you ask the script felt like it was written by a teenager for other teenagers the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical indeed the whole story felt <UNK> together from other well known stereotypes the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were <UNK> from the original series it was obviously <UNK> down for <UNK> of your average tv audience br br the human interaction was pitiful rather than drama based on subtle looks expressions and fine timing every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any <UNK> viewer such was obvious in any interaction between <UNK> and son the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and <UNK> viewer wouldn't miss it even if not paying attention sorry but real humans don't behave like the continually br br i wouldn't have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own nothing great it will never be <UNK> by true scifi fans or <UNK> but it would be watchable by the masses i personally could have lived without it though i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original br br how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers how even scifi channel has <UNK> down its productions to <UNK> to the masses as opposed to its true <UNK> market the science fiction fans it will be the time we asked for <UNK> and they insisted on giving us chicken despite our complaints br br i leave you with only one thought br br no moore br br
<START> man what the hell were the people who made this film on and more importantly where can i get some the opening scene sets the tone for the film a woman <UNK> naked in a circle of fire <UNK> into a werewolf and this is no rick baker <UNK> <UNK> transformation folks we're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here i can just imagine some stoned italian <UNK> <UNK> on naked <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> the film's <UNK> is that a word and asking her to roll in fur that's how bad it is br br from here on in it doesn't get much better minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors <UNK> on about <UNK> and her condition or something i can't remember but the dialogue is so bad if you don't laugh at it you'll cry br br the funny thing is <UNK> isn't even a werewolf she's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around understandable as she was raped as a child so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her <UNK> the opening scene she can't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets and she only wants to be loved things start looking up for <UNK> as she meets and falls in love with a buff <UNK> who doesn't trigger her <UNK> check out the montage here one of the <UNK> you'll ever see laughing and <UNK> after diving <UNK> through a window br br <UNK> luck doesn't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn she is suddenly <UNK> beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the <UNK> reminiscent of i spit on your grave <UNK> <UNK> bloody vengeance on her <UNK> br br this is 100 minutes of my life i will never get back but hey that's the game you play when you're a film geek
<START> when the folks at <UNK> video assembled their fine slapstick <UNK> collection a multi <UNK> selection of silent comedies someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many <UNK> an obscure one reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy as enjoyable as the set is over all this decision was an unfortunate one for one too many is a very poor film which almost <UNK> the viewer from watching further like any typical farce this one involves deception inspired by greed panic when plans go awry and complications <UNK> to the point of absurdity but unlike the good ones one too many is incoherent unfunny and downright annoying it's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film making but whatever the cause by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening and by the end one no longer cares br br the only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year old babe hardy who appears considerably <UNK> than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy in the opening scene awakening with a <UNK> babe performs a highly athletic <UNK> roll off a bed trust me that's as funny as this movie gets if you read this before seeing the first <UNK> of <UNK> slapstick <UNK> i suggest you fast forward past this one and skip to the good stuff
<START> after watching the trailer i was surprised this movie never made it into theaters so i ordered the <UNK> i had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there of course it has its flaws but i can still really recommend it the animation is well done very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end some of the backdrops are just drop dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it i thought that forest <UNK> performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character <UNK> <UNK> is depicted in this movie so overall thumbs up i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget <UNK> alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are <UNK> like hilarious
<START> this and <UNK> tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that <UNK> is disgusted by sex and these two films are <UNK> tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film it's not very well done some of the acting is truly <UNK> bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young woman's sudden flip flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the <UNK> sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense they're not explained at all i also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's <UNK> or <UNK> for <UNK> the central idea the idea that there's this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sex negative morality play
<START> with a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief the plot is well written and the cast was <UNK> every bit as good as the reviews suggested a <UNK> and was highly entertaining being a huge john candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment
<START> this movie is hilarious not in good way the fights are awfully bad done while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones and even this happens only two or three times definitely not enough to call it a <UNK> a <UNK> means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with <UNK> pick up a gun start shooting back and not get hurt br br the story empty guy waking up lost his memory starts fighting <UNK> that's what he's good at five years later memories come back takes revenge <UNK> br br not worth your buck not really worth your time unless you're drunk and bored
<START> this film reminded me so much of a history of violence which <UNK> to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie <UNK> as some thinking film on violence dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless <UNK> from the local <UNK> who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble don't these men have a job anyway dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk <UNK> by such gruesome means as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> over someone feet being blown off by a shotgun and <UNK> head getting caught in a bear trap funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it br br sam <UNK> who made the wild bunch which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was <UNK> but it was done with style and you believed it straw dogs is not believable first of all the location is wrong and does not work why place it in england i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930's or something second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife br br sam <UNK> missed the mark on this one
<START> very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas can't say much about this film without giving away the story i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture everybody has his or her own agenda nice little surprise at the end after all the other surprises well written with good performances by all
<START> i am so disappointed this movie left me feeling <UNK> out of my time and mental energy here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again the neurotic upper class <UNK> <UNK> whether or not they will cheat on their <UNK> woody i've seen these characters already i've seen the storyline from you ten times already where did your creativity go you need to open your eyes and look around you the world has changed dramatically since annie hall and you need to change along with it br br there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and <UNK> why not try them out instead of <UNK> the same old <UNK> over and over and over again br br when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out it does nothing for me because now i've come to expect his old <UNK> the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating depressing and same old same old br br if woody wants to win his fans back then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be <UNK> not insulted
<START> when will i ever learn the <UNK> reviewer on <UNK> made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to <UNK> my <UNK> br br i will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and <UNK> and all the smoking if the plan was to <UNK> the characters it succeeded br br for a film to work at least in my simple <UNK> there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned <UNK> came close and i could not wait for him to finish off <UNK> if a stray shot had struck <UNK> well it may have <UNK> a <UNK> of indifference at the most br br i can't remember when i <UNK> a film as strongly i suppose i'm a <UNK> who doesn't dig art flicks oh well
<START> i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music br br is the cartoonish acting of howard <UNK> meant to <UNK> the interest of otherwise jaded children br br is william <UNK> campy contemporary for the time acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s 70s <UNK> br br do we need all the in jokes about ny <UNK> i can hear the blue haired broadway audience <UNK> on cue br br sorry i find the whole piece dated boring the acting far too <UNK> for the screen
<START> it's so rare to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves but not by much as a long time student of <UNK> works i have no <UNK> in <UNK> the film to his readers at least to those that love him as i do the casting is inspired nolte is understated in triumph <UNK> in defeat <UNK> in judgment <UNK> lee is <UNK> throughout but her handling of the <UNK> <UNK> and her tragic <UNK> almost makes you forget her beauty alan arkin delivers a totally lovable but equally <UNK> soviet spy br br do not feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though if you haven't read mother night you will probably want to after viewing the film br br notice the shifts from color to black and white and back again and don't miss the final symbolism of <UNK> <UNK> watch also for kurt <UNK> cameo near the end of the film br br bing <UNK> white christmas will never sound the same i write in mid december when the song is getting heavy radio play and it's driving me nuts
<START> the only reason that i did not give this 10 stars was the dvd format no <UNK> extras etc however if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you this is one of the most life <UNK> films that i have ever seen and magical the acting is superb the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic this is one of those films that cult status used to be about i have recommended this film to all of my friends some love it some can't finish it whenever i think or feel that something is impossible i think about alan <UNK> role in this film sure wish he'd make more films
<START> enough is enough sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead the first tremors movie was great the second one was ridiculous the third one was nauseating the tv series was <UNK> awful and this movie just drives the stake deeper br br basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and <UNK> now we have the series set in the wild west in the <UNK> and they fight <UNK> like a rehash of the first one they have to learn how to beat them all over again mildly entertaining i suppose otherwise this straight to video release just like tremors 2 and 3 is just going way too far oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place did they just simply forget to record this <UNK> event i think something like this would be history making so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so <UNK> br br movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy avoid this garbage
<START> this movie can be interpreted on many different levels don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w e and that it is just about drugs it has very overt superficial <UNK> about drugs however the rest of the movie and why i think it was personally made is really not about that at all it is really mocking psychology and the <UNK> of society it shows for a split second that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online why my interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this <UNK> that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our <UNK> instead of seeing people as people as far as the scene about logic it is also reaching out to the people who were in the <UNK> <UNK> 1 smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and <UNK> and logical as it seems on a <UNK> level you have to apply <UNK> <UNK> principle along with all the other laws and principles of <UNK> not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and <UNK> along the way one of the best movies i have ever seen it just might go way above your head it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble <UNK> with life not working out like a <UNK> problem when you are <UNK> <UNK> a movie or writing your critical <UNK> try not reading the back cover first written by <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> when i heard that adrian <UNK> was in drag in this movie my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie <UNK> and the recommendation of a friend br br what i thought would be a broad mrs <UNK> type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy <UNK> is entirely credible and <UNK> as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross dressing on occasions he <UNK> these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion julie <UNK> is magnificent is as her habit as the <UNK> who teaches him <UNK> love
<START> man has been to the <UNK> reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds but with new worlds come ancient <UNK> the vampires of space and not just a handful but entire <UNK> in this film which i saw as <UNK> but i guess also goes as vampires wars we see what happens when the <UNK> <UNK> meet the <UNK> vampires br br i will make this review very short because it's <UNK> of a good review the best i can say for this film is it has a good cast of b list and upcoming stars <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> and was far more attractive here than in <UNK> 2 michael <UNK> is <UNK> and is always a fan favorite as i say he's the poor man's jack nicholson and we even get carrie ann <UNK> as <UNK> wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so this movie as bad as it is isn't without some names attached but the same can be said of uwe <UNK> work br br the concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard the acting especially from the vampires is over the top and i just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing worst of all the vampire <UNK> have the names <UNK> and <UNK> i understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn't clever at all it just sounded dumb and out of place unlike the much more subtle references in james <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> stores after lesser known horror directors br br that's all i want to say if you can stand lots of cheese on this day i couldn't and i'm from <UNK> and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth check this one out if you can find it i don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films jon carpenter's vampires or other cheesy space movies or maybe even some good ones but hey do your thing
<START> a simple and effective film about what life is all about <UNK> to challenges it took a lot of <UNK> for homer and his friends to be able to grow into <UNK> without falling in the trap of a <UNK> future that runs from father to son to be a <UNK> in the local mine and never get out of that fate it took also three different challenges for homer and his friends to <UNK> a personal and free future the challenge of the first ever man made artificial satellite <UNK> 1 a soviet satellite a <UNK> in human history a turning point that homer and his friends could not miss did not want to miss then the challenge of science and applied <UNK> to <UNK> and to <UNK> a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds finally the challenge of a world that <UNK> and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack even with an <UNK> accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity and even then homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was <UNK> for a while his own plans and dreams but there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough homer is the <UNK> of the project but he is also the <UNK> of the inspiration he and his friends need if he is the one who is going to get the university <UNK> because his friends gave him <UNK> his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes it is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a <UNK> on a difficult road but the film is also effective to show how the father <UNK> this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man like mining or football the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often <UNK> by the traditional thinking of the father if the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day the working class fate i am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think this might have been the fourth challenge homer had to face the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and <UNK> by his own father br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK>

<START> running man <UNK> <UNK> the modern day american media complex and hits its target dead center it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less <UNK> <UNK> takes on pro wrestling featuring some pro <UNK> as the hunters network television the <UNK> ratings the american government suggesting it's entertainment oriented anyway crime punishment and a half dozen other things along the way it's a far cry from the original stephen king <UNK> and arnold is not the ben richards of the <UNK> either but who cares it's basically a arnie flick with all the well choreographed action sequences and one liners such an <UNK> requires
<START> john <UNK> performance in once upon a crime is possibly his best ever it's been my favourite movie since it came out i spent 5 years searching for it that's how good it is if you disagree well that's your opinion enjoy the movie
<START> if you have plenty of time to waste it's ok it moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the <UNK> br br the acting is ok <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> does the best job and is the most believable br br william r <UNK> played a pretty good part as the husband br br <UNK> <UNK> as the wife had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed br br the ending is sort of silly like most of these <UNK> movies there are parts that are interesting but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time
<START> just think it cost a total of 250 000 to make <UNK> how the hell did they spend 45 million to make this <UNK> music video a practically unknown cast two or three sets no special effects that i could see i know it must have been spent on that expertly crafted <UNK> tension filled screenplay shoot that bar set must have cost a <UNK> anyway i guess jerry bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less i'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything br br anyway it wasn't an awful film i guess the female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok imo it just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for 5 million without any loss to the production and 6 more 5 million dollar <UNK> films of merit could have been made as well
<START> spoilers with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean john carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune some <UNK> million dollars the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion there seemed to have been a mix up in the story when we later find out that it's really an overnight <UNK> not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for <UNK> money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise br br the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the <UNK> christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has his head chopped off <UNK> and then served on a <UNK> to a shocked group of guests later that evening cute little <UNK> greg and <UNK> jeff <UNK> marry <UNK> little pet <UNK> is found dead outside floating in the pond br br the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it's revealed who the killer really is we then have what seems to be a double twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest the real killer ends up not only getting all the <UNK> <UNK> million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his <UNK> by doing him or her in by giving him a <UNK> cookie that kills him on the spot br br nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such <UNK> and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking there's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the <UNK> guests that includes incest s m <UNK> and of course double dealing and back stabbing not even counting murder you just couldn't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do br br even the big surprise at the end isn't really that much of a surprise since the killer's identity is <UNK> with the film maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself we then have a plot twist that <UNK> the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is the final plot twist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie

<START> my family has watched arthur bach stumble and <UNK> since the movie first came out we have most lines <UNK> i watched it two weeks ago and still get <UNK> at the simple humor and view at life that dudley moore portrays <UNK> <UNK> did a wonderful job as the side kick though i'm not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his <UNK> house his conversation with the butler and <UNK> father is side spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by <UNK> <UNK> yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my <UNK> <UNK> on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff
<START> this insipid mini <UNK> featuring a eddy <UNK> prototype in a <UNK> scenario is so bad it becomes an <UNK> exercise after five minutes it's silly from the get go as this <UNK> opens two military men discussing the lack of <UNK> in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to <UNK> where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br alexander gray and <UNK> <UNK> possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so <UNK> scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br this two <UNK> was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and <UNK> the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed <UNK> is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
<START> say what you will about <UNK> one beauty of this film is that it is not pro american it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose br br to me the most interesting part of the film is the education of <UNK> and david <UNK> bette <UNK> mother and brother as <UNK> says we've been <UNK> out of the <UNK> br br in today's political climate where led by a president who shamelessly <UNK> to us and used 9 11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings we sunk to the level of the 9 11 murderers to seek blood <UNK> vengeance it can't all be blamed on mr bush after all we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re elected him after his lies had been exposed now with complete justification we americans are <UNK> throughout the world br br today we watch this film with a new awareness that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character but a flaw in human beings that allows us to <UNK> anything that will justify our committing <UNK> and <UNK> acts i'm not comparing george bush to <UNK> hitler but i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror hatred and hyper <UNK> to do despicable things br br sadly the <UNK> who will do whatever needs to be done for his own <UNK> no matter how <UNK> is most like the leaders of our country those who support them and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can't even be bothered to vote br br a film like watch on the <UNK> reminds us of what we once <UNK> to be a force for the <UNK> of humanity and that we have it in us to once again <UNK> to <UNK> goals br br <UNK>
<START> offering a killer <UNK> of terrible writing terrible acting and terrible direction it's a <UNK> whether <UNK> forbidden subjects is <UNK> bad or just hilariously bad it's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the <UNK> <UNK> cannon film as if a glance at a cast list including characters like <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> gentleman ' <UNK> <UNK> weren't enough it's your only chance to see charles <UNK> cop throw a <UNK> on a bed and grab a <UNK> but don't worry it's okay as the <UNK> screams make clear he's only torturing him for information after all even if he is a bit <UNK> of his nice catholic daughter he's a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william <UNK> a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice or at least <UNK> that the bad guys end up in the <UNK> with the <UNK> inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine but then that's what you get for telling him look i think you're a little bit unstable still when later offered a <UNK> he may <UNK> i'd like to <UNK> this up your ass but i don't want to get my hands dirty he's clearly learned where to draw the line instead he just makes him eat a 25 000 watch and sets fire to his <UNK> the <UNK> obsession even follows through to the film's title despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set the film's only direct example of <UNK> forbidden subjects as alex hyde <UNK> english teacher explains to a group of japanese <UNK> is er talking about your <UNK> movements in polite society br br bronson isn't just too old for this as the opening fight makes only too clear he's too old for love interest peggy <UNK> and she looks old enough to have grown up kids a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material here's he's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous <UNK> quirks when he's not <UNK> the circles of suspects he's accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings he's definitely not a p c <UNK> with a special loathing for the japanese as if it wasn't bad enough that they're buying up american <UNK> what's worse they double park on a public <UNK> no racial minority goes <UNK> be they black <UNK> or <UNK> hotel clerk no cop cliché <UNK> be it a boss who <UNK> his fist on the table or a dead meat partner perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair <UNK> that's so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own the twin plot <UNK> <UNK> l a cop trying to take down juan <UNK> <UNK> who deals in <UNK> girls and james <UNK> porn obsessed japanese businessman  take forever to <UNK> and then in the most unlikely of ways after <UNK> a feel of <UNK> daughter on a bus some oriental guy touched my holy of <UNK> in the film's idea of poetic justice <UNK> finds his own daughter kidnapped by <UNK> you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say how <UNK> like them <UNK> br br somewhere underneath all the <UNK> is the <UNK> of a good idea even if it is too <UNK> developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is but the execution is pure rising sun the <UNK> <UNK> version shot like out takes from an r rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy <UNK> shoot 'em up and <UNK> up finale that sees a small army of machine <UNK> <UNK> suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count the last of <UNK> mostly bad to in different <UNK> with j lee thompson  and sadly <UNK> last film as director it's a poor <UNK> for two <UNK> players who increasingly never seemed to be that <UNK> about what pictures they said yes to
<START> you know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair in what seems to be a <UNK> truck only to have the prison vehicle <UNK> with and i'm not making this up a genetic <UNK> <UNK> truck the goo which <UNK> forth <UNK> him and <UNK> his <UNK> with the snow creating our protagonist the killer snowman br br my favorite portion of the movie however is an over the shoulder shot of the snowman <UNK> some poor <UNK> in which his hands look <UNK> like a couple of white <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> schlock
<START> i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it br br this is really not an ordinary horror movie it has some horror elements but i rather <UNK> it as fantasy i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes especially the scene when <UNK> dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short br br now to the plot this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house the paperhouse when she <UNK> a sleep which often strangely happens just immediately she finds herself near the house on a big green field she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to as she forgets to draw his legs because he is sitting behind a window the boy cannot walk later she is being told by the doctor that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams as she misses her father who is <UNK> abroad she draws her father into the house she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn and next time she falls asleep the horror begins her father is mad and blind because she draw s on his head to mark him as <UNK> and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend her dreams became a horrendous nightmare they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those <UNK> happenings anna draws a <UNK> and notices that the same <UNK> can be found near the hotel they traveled to she runs to the <UNK> and meets the boy i am just not mentioning his name because i cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous <UNK> page and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever br br there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall i hated that scene it was so dumb to me it almost ruined the main horror scene br br things i liked were the scene with the photograph of <UNK> dad which was the first real scary and horror scene i liked the boy the actor was awesome he was even better than anna i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage br br overall a good movie i give it a 8 out of 10
<START> when john <UNK> is on he's on and this is one of his better films not quite as tight as <UNK> n the hood but close to it and with much of the same stellar cast this film was very well written very well put together and very well shot there's very little to criticize and most of my complaints are superficial <UNK> where did <UNK> get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff no mention of a rich background and why doesn't professor <UNK> have an office a professor of his stature should have one and while we're at it for an <UNK> student <UNK> or not <UNK> a pretty dumb character i'd think that he'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence he talks and acts like a total <UNK> br br but that aside the film was very sharp a good array of characters and points of view and <UNK> doesn't take sides in the story many of the characters are unsympathetic and he does a good job of <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> scenes together to show the <UNK> on both sides br br much of the cinematography was excellent i especially loved the scene where <UNK> <UNK> gets intimate with <UNK> and wayne each scene spliced together really well also the <UNK> <UNK> scenes were really well shot as well br br the dialogue was a bit much at times this film had a tendency to get really preachy at times and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the <UNK> we really didn't need the us flag with <UNK> <UNK> onto it give some credit we're not morons and to top it off although most of the time <UNK> uses melodrama quite well sometimes it gets way too <UNK> like <UNK> death which is fine until she screams out <UNK> ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene br br but the acting in general was top of the line fabulous performances by omar <UNK> perhaps the best i've ever seen <UNK> <UNK> who knew buffy could act michael <UNK> surprised the hell out of me after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one role actor and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are always outstanding br br downside jennifer <UNK> was flat though it's not completely her fault her role was stereotypical and one dimensional generic to the highest degree and <UNK> banks who had the role was nothing short of horrid she <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> yet another in the long line of models turned actresses who failed miserably though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule br br finally the soundtrack wow an amazing soundtrack which is definitely worth buying which fits the film like a <UNK> each scene has a twin song although the <UNK> <UNK> songs started to really annoy me by the end not her best work liz <UNK> rage against the machine ice cube how can one go wrong br br all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film 8 10
<START> this movie is <UNK> in an episode of mystery science theater 3000 i think mst3k was at its best when they ripped this movie br br terrible acting bad makeup poor effects chick in skimpy 1960's underwear i give it a 2 br br the villain is hard to understand due to the makeup the assistant says things like <UNK> <UNK> that sound like <UNK> think <UNK> it's just poor <UNK> the long <UNK> are hilarious on one of the characters br br i still don't know what 'the projected man' means in terms of the plot i missed some of the beginning though br br what is up with this 10 line minimum on <UNK>
<START> this movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well crafted series of tense sequences <UNK> with an inevitable <UNK> at the end of each really there is no character development and no real plot to speak of there are only the most <UNK> of motivations for the characters to do anything while they <UNK> forward to their <UNK> <UNK> it's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his <UNK> and his ghost mom with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like the ring take down a bunch of cardboard cut out two dimensional excuses for human characters br br this english language version of the grudge is the equivalent of cinematic junk food satisfying <UNK> but not really what you ought to be living on br br not recommended
