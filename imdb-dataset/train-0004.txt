<START> this movie sucks from beginning till especially the end you probably don't get <UNK> any worse acting storyline photography camera work <UNK> it's all bad very very bad br br but that's what makes it a <UNK> watch it will give you more than enough good laughs the worse the better br br i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie a serious <UNK> movie the story is <UNK> ridiculous it's more like a comedy in disguise kinda like mafia also pointless but damn funny br br and look out for the very very end of the movie <UNK>
<START> the film starts out very slowly with the lifestyle of wallace <UNK> an attendant at a photo service drop off station his wife has been <UNK> to her home with an <UNK> <UNK> as the result of a sentence for <UNK> wallace is a member of the <UNK> fire department and takes <UNK> seriously br br as we watch <UNK> rather dull life <UNK> suddenly there comes something new and jarring a traveling carnival comes to town one of its stars is wilder <UNK> <UNK> brother he's a clown but he has a special talent br br so does wallace they're both <UNK> or <UNK> people capable of starting fires through mental energy wallace keeps his powers secret wilder lets his <UNK> know what he can do br br spoiler some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a <UNK> wallace holds back from using his powers wilder wants to go public on national tv br br <UNK> the matter wilder wants <UNK> wife whom they both dated years earlier she becomes a bone of <UNK> and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal <UNK> br br the film is entertaining but not laugh out loud funny i think enough of it to have a copy in my library it's a good offbeat film
<START> disappointing predictable film in which a woman <UNK> <UNK> travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness in this genre <UNK> but <UNK> starring susan sarandon and natalie portman gave a much better insight into a mother daughter relationship with better acting as well
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is all about a ghastly old <UNK> who <UNK> her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite there's a bit of subtext that might be about <UNK> colonial past but it's mostly just <UNK> doing the sorts of things like deliberately <UNK> a small child in a park that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers sadly that doesn't happen here it looks good and the acting is fine and there's nothing really wrong with the concept but it's just so smug god does this movie love itself pity it isn't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is the only <UNK> in the show sorry movie comes from <UNK> getting <UNK> and <UNK> and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this that's right just like in a sitcom which is what this is with the added <UNK> of <UNK> of <UNK> and a <UNK> minute running time
<START> one shot one kill no exceptions a must see if you are into marines or <UNK> two big thumbs up great overall storyline great camera work good drama action details and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans
<START> sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again but after loads of amazing <UNK> tashan finally ended as heart attack br br such amazing 3 songs in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tashan <UNK> and what u get in the movie zero story predictable plot plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss br br music wise another major disaster in the music album they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 <UNK> and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts that song is such nice quite comparable to tashan <UNK> and that is not taken in the music album if you plan to watch this movie i would say watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like <UNK> bachchan <UNK> ' br br overall very disappointed even with the way <UNK> has made attempt to speak bad english br br go away man i need to <UNK>
<START> not being familiar with us television stations when i <UNK> onto this on my in <UNK> cable first i thought it was just a low budget sci fi film then after a couple of minutes i started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst <UNK> of christian <UNK> and then it <UNK> on me good grief these people are serious it's been a while since i saw anything so unintentionally hilarious i <UNK> about writing a review of this for fear of <UNK> <UNK> but then i saw other reviews and thought hey they can take it tough philosophical <UNK> how do you make a movie <UNK> movies without actually showing what it is you're <UNK> answer make it in such a way that the only people <UNK> appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're <UNK> i suppose some <UNK> ugh spit when you say that might be offended at the <UNK> contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the j c myth but i didn't mind it was so darn funny
<START> i'm rarely moved to make a comment online about a film but i can't understand how this one got made who made it how could they have possibly thought they were capable of making a feature film did they do a weekend course at some film school get a nice big <UNK> from daddy and kidnap david <UNK> family one by one until he agreed to be in it or was he by any chance a longtime family friend distant relation doing this out of sheer misplaced kindness i don't care don't want to know even he looks utterly embarrassed to be in it <UNK> his lines and hiding his face from the camera meanwhile the <UNK> must have been the <UNK> from <UNK> there seemed to be absolutely no sound design the script the direction and editing were all abysmal and quite frankly the <UNK> that <UNK> me right now means that i can't be bothered to spend any more of my life thinking about this film
<START> i fell asleep on my couch at 7 <UNK> last night watching larry sanders i usually <UNK> it but not last night woke up at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the west coast and was fascinated to see this on <UNK> i was shocked on how poor this <UNK> was seriously shocked so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb this is really really bad the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a <UNK> at a film school br br yes it is shot video mind you that is shot on video not digital video it does look like a soap opera the clips from <UNK> videos have a more <UNK> feel to them then this horror br br i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything the shots and <UNK> are stupid yes i chose the word <UNK> not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid i know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example i cant it was <UNK> but trust me i know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews br br
<START> like others i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings including a few dramatic works <UNK> based on the actions and psycho mythology of the participants to the crime including capote himself as to capote i cannot forgive him for <UNK> <UNK> perry smith's <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> from even the defense <UNK> i believe truths and facts capote reserved for his book which required for capote two guilty <UNK> and capital punishment would almost certainly have <UNK> a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old <UNK> rule capote himself could never write another major literary work after in cold blood shame and guilt in my opinion he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book drama to him both men had to die for his book to succeed the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment his actions and silence assured that ice cold conclusion br br <UNK> book is not truth it is not factual or <UNK> it is drama and melodrama <UNK> with his own <UNK> psychotic imagination what most people consider the virtues of the <UNK> first movie are stark images of <UNK> mind which may have been the most cold blooded aspect of all no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer <UNK> performance that actor is the nightmare from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br so who is to say how the two killers should be played who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to do it now killing i agree with the few who see in eric <UNK> work a magnificent performance shakespearean in its range yet played with heartbreaking sincerity anthony <UNK> takes a much <UNK> attitude mode to create a smarmy <UNK> but he is one dimensional and boring with only a few notes in his television range roberts is almost four dimensional adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do like leopold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man without <UNK> or a man of his <UNK> perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life br br given the freedom from <UNK> death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings roberts and <UNK> are free to create original personalities and <UNK> to craft a different and new production of the drama same facts some of the same lines from the case record but deeper more complex with clearly titanic psychotic <UNK> indeed roberts is so good at this <UNK> madness that he physically and <UNK> demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is br br what many of our reviewers dislike about this film roberts in particular is that cold blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic interpretation of life and death than capote could ever create a real tragedy br br the actual cold blooded killer mr capote and his <UNK> artistic non fiction novel do not control these interpretations and performances br br if in cold blood and <UNK> effect on life literature and truth matters as much as <UNK> say then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth or a version of the truth that is not the rank cowardly lie drawn up from the <UNK> of <UNK> own <UNK>
<START> this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it's a very enjoyable light hearted piece of <UNK> in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for it's feel good factor alone ok so frank sinatra's acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his <UNK> acting ability <UNK> through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago
<START> new york has never looked so good and neither has anyone in this movie while the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it you almost wish people like this really existed the appeal of the actors are what really put it over john ritter <UNK> camp and the late dorothy <UNK> are particularly good go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did
<START> this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decent but i found the acting terrible the exception was <UNK> jean <UNK> i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say <UNK> i cringe i nearly attacked a <UNK> the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life br br i <UNK> if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion
<START> a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard welcome to the <UNK> of cheaply made direct to video movies its full of no name actors and actresses with little valuable plot br br anyway this strange game goes on and our hero <UNK> real money and does good at it it is sort of like gambling except the gambling part is gone and it sucks instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good br br what makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to <UNK> br br overall not even worth a 1 rental borrow it please d
<START> it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was consequently they had even more trouble delivering it they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub atomic <UNK> having established a fuzzy picture of <UNK> <UNK> principle they presented a <UNK> of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic <UNK> that every living person is an <UNK> which follows the same quantum rules on a <UNK> scale then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen <UNK> and tony robbins have made their careers positive thinking <UNK> bad <UNK> always look on the bright side etc next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of <UNK> <UNK> which we more or less choose to create if you are sad you will create sad <UNK> if you are happy you will create happy <UNK> it's just so simple isn't it <UNK> with our lessons we follow the <UNK> life of amanda a photographer who pops anti <UNK> and hates her <UNK> the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say hey amanda just cheer up why can't she cheer up obviously it's because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion that's why the conclusion of the film which is basically the entire second half brought on a <UNK> of <UNK> we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings but a collective consciousness but we are individuals who can change the world but there are many of each of us because of all the different <UNK> but we can choose who we are and we have a purpose to do good but there is no god because there is nothing better than us so there is no such thing as right and wrong so there is no such thing as reward or punishment so nothing good ever came out of religion but we should still do good anyway even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all <UNK> and then crime will <UNK> and if we say nice things our water will freeze into pretty <UNK> still with me good because there is more according to robert l park in his book voodoo science the whole <UNK> experiment put on by john <UNK> in washington d c was a farce the numbers were <UNK> and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight br br so does all this work or not i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where <UNK> <UNK> one of the film's three directors yes three <UNK> questions following the show i call myself lucky because i had first hand <UNK> that these people don't know what they are talking about several of the questions asked by audience members had her so <UNK> that her husband a <UNK> had to step in and <UNK> the answer i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political and everyone including ms <UNK> began <UNK> as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie
<START> the movie's storyline is pat and quaint two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves unfortunately if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central asia this is absolutely terrible br br the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it to begin with and most <UNK> incorrect the <UNK> as they were known in the thirties and indeed since the <UNK> and their <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> shah of <UNK> were not <UNK> in fact they have not been <UNK> since the <UNK> <UNK> of central asia over three <UNK> ago br br second the city that is filmed as <UNK> is not <UNK> which is understandable however the <UNK> of the area around the city could not be more strikingly different than the city of <UNK> which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range which <UNK> all of the cities views br br third <UNK> despite the fact it is spoken in iran and afghanistan is never heard in movie when there are native <UNK> who do not speak in german they speak in <UNK> the <UNK> guards at the border in fact say to each other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is not a man and not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as it would be in <UNK> also the love song between the indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in spanish while talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the <UNK> uses the words <UNK> and <UNK> and makes some reference to drugs <UNK> these words certainly never appear in the <UNK> as they are <UNK> for paradise indeed <UNK> and paradise are very distant <UNK> between our languages and <UNK> respectively though <UNK> is admittedly close to <UNK> which is hell in <UNK> when they encounter the <UNK> in the desert the language spoken is also <UNK> this despite the fact that there are no native <UNK> of <UNK> in iran and afghanistan and its use is primarily religious with some use in education at that time br br when they are stopped in iran before they reach the <UNK> border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any iranian group their <UNK> are typically <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> the walls and a high profile in iran it is also extremely <UNK> for people to wear <UNK> unless they are a <UNK> the language spoken is clearly <UNK> from the initial <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ' when they do reach <UNK> the desert they find themselves in is sandy totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the <UNK> parts of the <UNK> <UNK> mountain range there is an absence of the light green <UNK> that covers the ground in the summer and spring the area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name the indian killers because of its difficult and <UNK> ground br br in short the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place it lacks any real draw to it being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to <UNK> however even that is still born and no real development is felt leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose in short this is a really bad movie that i would have rated at one star except for the good footage of <UNK> and the <UNK> of the <UNK> even if they are <UNK>
<START> <UNK> got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is <UNK> kapoor falling head over heels in love with <UNK> <UNK> by the way don't you think he's a little old for her br br things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when <UNK> tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an over protective neat freak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor <UNK> for no good reason one of the reasons i really don't like this movie is because i can't stand to see <UNK> my favorite actress get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening br br anyway all i'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting <UNK> you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else
<START> i have always been a great admirer of nicolas <UNK> and <UNK> is one of my favorite films this is a film version of <UNK> stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of <UNK> cinematic <UNK> very unique story is about a famous actress <UNK> russell who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor michael <UNK> and together in his hotel room they talk after awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get <UNK> her husband is <UNK> on the door her husband is a famous ex baseball player gary busey and he wants to know what is going on the three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them meanwhile a famous senator tony curtis is threatening to take away the <UNK> papers if he doesn't <UNK> at a hearing <UNK> russell is just excellent and while she's not trying exactly to <UNK> marilyn monroe she does a wonderful job of <UNK> the <UNK> and nuances that monroe is very well known for one thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well she talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a <UNK> you can make an excellent case that this is <UNK> best performance and i probably wouldn't argue the film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen <UNK> as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought the last scene in this film is a <UNK> of his darker side one of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man will <UNK> of <UNK> nest and they discuss what <UNK> indians think about at all times but of course the famous scene in this film is where russell demonstrates to <UNK> how she does understand the theory of <UNK> and uses toys to show this the professor is delighted by her <UNK> and so are we russell and <UNK> are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
<START> i waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when i first saw it over 10 years ago i wanted to think carefully about what i wanted to write br br i found from a documentary standpoint that this is a <UNK> good documentary it did what it set out to do show me something i had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored i knew nothing of the drag world and finding out about them and the balls was just spectacular to me these folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it for competition the <UNK> folks the <UNK> even i was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the drag queen was wearing wasn't a man's coat the jealous it's all there like in every other competition like every other competition like it which i felt was a point br br you had the older drag queen talking about how the balls used to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the balls and made more competition categories and even those who looked on knowing that the future of balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the <UNK> it was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete it was that important to them then there was sad stories stories of who's house and house mother brought out the best and the <UNK> in competition it was interesting br br now to add after 10 years of seeing this film i lived through the so called <UNK> <UNK> i spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with madonna during her <UNK> phase and rightfully so if not for those individuals madonna wouldn't have had a <UNK> phase i know that now credit should be given where credit is due makes me wonder if anyone else from mainstream america would watch this documentary they'll learn they're not as mainstream as they think
<START> slight spoilers br br a <UNK> 15 year old boy kisses a very cute 15 year old girl and eventually he has sex for the first time after the act he lays in the bed with her not touching her the next day he concludes that he does not like sex much and does not want to try it again for at least a few years br br this is seemingly a fine opening for a <UNK> about a boy discovering his homosexuality or perhaps a medical drama about a post <UNK> teen with a severe <UNK> <UNK> br br however as the plot develops what emerges is a story of a 15 year old father who is supported and encouraged by his overbearing mother br br at one point his mother <UNK> to her co workers who are not as understanding as they might be every step of the way in this my son has been amazing i have never been more proud of him br br the young father's older sister who otherwise is cold towards her brother begins to show pride in her sibling you have been cool about this as she gives him an <UNK> warm hug br br the 15 year old father wants to be a father he wants to be a parent br br why not we see the new baby a few minutes after birth it appears to be a healthy happy 4 month old <UNK> just as babies were born on tv in the 1960's and 1970's br br once the young father is a parent he has found happiness he insists he will be the one to change the dirty <UNK> we see the 15 year old father sincerely happy holding his baby while the <UNK> busy body mother is <UNK> over his shoulder fade to black
<START> before i start i love eddie izzard i think he's one of the funniest stand ups around today possibly that means i'm going into this with too high expectations but i just didn't find eddie funny in this outing br br i think the main problem is eddie is trying too hard to be eddie everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it but in circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places many of the topics he covers he has covered before i even think i <UNK> a few recycled jokes in there br br if you buy the dvd you'll find a behind the scenes look at <UNK> tour interesting in places but not very funny and a french language version of one of his shows die <UNK> will enjoy seeing eddie in a different language but subtitled comedy isn't very funny br br if you're a fan of eddie you've either got this already or you're going to buy it whatever i say if you're just passing through buy glorious or dressed to kill you won't be disappointed with circle you probably will
<START> i finally caught up to <UNK> last night on television and all i can say is wow it's hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects check out the laser <UNK> shooting out of <UNK> eyes the atrocious acting the <UNK> dialogue the <UNK> use of stock footage or the air of earnest <UNK> that <UNK> the entire production this truly is a one of a kind experience and we should all be thankful for that i <UNK> <UNK> kay as the true heir to ed wood
<START> <UNK> is using a well known formula as someone pointed out however i have seen plenty of movies that don't do it this well or that are not this credible i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the movie br br the movie is <UNK> both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general this is the movie that gave me the spark br br so the plot is familiar common actors are good but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion it made a big impression on me and i know i'm not the only one
<START> four great stories from master robert <UNK> adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent <UNK> production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid seventies and it's one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode <UNK> to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child <UNK> to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous <UNK> of the english cinema
<START> the kids i took to this movie loved it four children ages 9 to 12 years they would have given it 10 stars emma roberts was adorable in the title role expect to see more of this next generation roberts in the future after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears lindsay <UNK> and paris hilton it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look like she worked the streets also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included <UNK> <UNK> rachel leigh cook barry <UNK> and monica parker with a cameo by bruce willis final <UNK> cute film br br note i did not read the book series so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone
<START> yeah pretty sure i saw this movie years ago when it was about the <UNK> br br another recycled storyline <UNK> up hollywood style <UNK> scripts from better making it in the music industry films br br nothing original here br br more make up <UNK> costumes and choreography more money for the <UNK> talented <UNK> draw br br if you like the <UNK> style you should appreciate actual groups who <UNK> without having <UNK> voices and a hollywood empire br br <UNK> involvement makes this <UNK> garbage
<START> a really great movie and true story dan <UNK> the greatest <UNK> ever a touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy the story of jane <UNK> battle with cancer and dan <UNK> love for his sister of a important promise made by <UNK> to win a gold <UNK> to prove his sister jane was right to believe in his talent in speed <UNK> was justified this picture is well worth the time i wish they would make more films of this quality thank you for a great film with excellent actors and an excellent story it is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister
<START> this is a re imagining of tarzan in the era of the <UNK> and apocalypse now there's nothing <UNK> wrong with using films <UNK> moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the tarzan legend there's nothing <UNK> wrong with the premise that tarzan doesn't speak there's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an african jungle in <UNK> could be this <UNK> stupid and plastic bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video <UNK> as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your <UNK> fantasies into the project if it succeeds anywhere it's in the <UNK> that national <UNK> has influenced the way the imagery of a tarzan movie might be constructed br br it would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual <UNK> as one of many tools to draw in viewers some really great film moments <UNK> it but this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum the <UNK> is the only thing going on here at the time of its release and now you sit through awful dumb scenes that offer no interest and miles of footage of bad acting to <UNK> over the next <UNK> at either of two bodies yes bo derek and miles <UNK> are beautiful um <UNK> on having a working <UNK> but if that's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up there's only a <UNK> <UNK> difference between the two <UNK> and i'm just guessing here a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter the question is whether a mainstream movie is the best <UNK> in the <UNK> for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone br br as a <UNK> john derek successfully <UNK> on the sexual <UNK> developed over wife bo in the movie 10 and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the <UNK> of the two leads the movie itself was beside the point he was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid shallow movie that was only about <UNK> <UNK> br br as a director john derek appears to require only that mrs derek look pleasant empty and <UNK> able in every scene it's <UNK> shot the camera placement is annoying in terms of editing the entire <UNK> <UNK> is exhausted the credit sequence is <UNK> and it's a toss up as to who commits the worse screen offense bo derek who's such a bimbo that she can't even figure out how to play a bimbo or richard harris who shouts every line as he likes to do until you want to shoot him at least with bo you can imagine her <UNK> some horny writer for <UNK> her
<START> <UNK> damn it the <UNK> will <UNK> admit the truth i <UNK> like this cheap cheesy 70's parody the idea that vast <UNK> of killer tomatoes are destroying the us is a great idea and in spite of itself the <UNK> does provide some decent chuckles <UNK> the sight of terrified extras running away from large obviously fake tomatoes this film along with the kentucky fried <UNK> is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs which became so popular in the 80's 90's thanks largely to airplane this one like <UNK> spoofs is pretty poor many attempts at humor are dismal failures and will <UNK> much <UNK> but thanks to the <UNK> tomatoes <UNK> the obnoxious <UNK> love song and the awesome helicopter crash scene attack of the killer tomatoes does provide some goods though largely for the wrong reasons there are <UNK> many things wrong with this film and so right it's hard to explain enough people must also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films and a cartoon series large <UNK> of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull and dig those 70's clothes dude 8 this <UNK> is seedy and cheesy but worth a chuckle or two the <UNK> says grab a pizza and pop in the tomatoes <UNK>
<START> tarzan and his mate 1934 was the only tarzan movie i didn't see when i was a kid it sounded boring now i have seen it i have seen the ape man 1932 about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive it's a remarkable movie it's almost flawless tarzan and his mate 1934 however <UNK> it's not <UNK> and it's parts tend to live a life of there own the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great big budget expensive tarzan himself is co starring jane <UNK> she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead well she let her be <UNK> by a <UNK> who <UNK> a kiss from her and later murder an elephant she insists tarzan to carry a <UNK> who <UNK> to her father forever the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his <UNK> in the jungle stupid later someone <UNK> it in the river well it's supposed to proof tarzan is dead some cheap drama the <UNK> who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away to england stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is how hard he is to kill the <UNK> is leaving and jane go along again a <UNK> she could easily make the <UNK> rest for a few hours or more to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband she could be smart she could dive where they found the floating <UNK> check the banks for <UNK> she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in <UNK> picking up <UNK> shouldn't be too hard for jungle jane she could talk to the apes and so on if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with i blame myself as much as you a punishment for being <UNK> perhaps nonsense struggle a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate still this movie is far from bad even if the <UNK> are many and sometimes deep just lean back and enjoy it's tarzan and jane for god sake
<START> i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never heard of but it was a <UNK> so why not check it out br br well my guess is that mr blonde would very much like to forget he's ever taken part in such a shame of a film br br apparently if your script and dialogs are terrible even good actors cannot save the day not to mention the amateur actors that <UNK> this film too many non native english <UNK> play parts of native english <UNK> reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie it's unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound the music is awful and totally out of place and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play br br i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other better movies this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves
<START> full house is a great show i am still today growing up on it i started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and it's great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit com i give it 5 out of 5 stars what do you think oh and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office it will make you feel a lot better trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well that's too bad for you because you won't get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon
<START> william powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex wife in the ex mrs <UNK> also starring jean arthur eric <UNK> and james <UNK> it seems that powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed though he and myrna loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other thin man type movies one with ginger rogers and this one with arthur both to very good effect br br somehow one never gets tired of seeing powell as a witty <UNK> professional and the ex mrs <UNK> is no exception the ex mrs b has mr b served with a <UNK> for back <UNK> and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she's dragged him into and this isn't the first time she's done that it almost seems as though there was a <UNK> film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films mr b complains that his mystery writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases this time a <UNK> riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line br br the solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it's beside the point the point is the banter between the couple and the <UNK> of the ex mrs b jean arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny however with an actress who comes off as <UNK> as arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than <UNK> i suspect the writer had something else in mind say the wacky side of carole lombard when arthur hears that the police have arrived she says ah it's probably about my <UNK> i've been waiting for the police to take a hand in it it's more of a <UNK> to powell rather than a serious statement it still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own br br definitely worth watching as william powell and jean arthur always were
<START> as you probably already know jess franco is one prolific guy hes made hundreds upon hundreds of films many of which are crap however he managed to sneak in an occasionally quality work amongst all the <UNK> line exploitation <UNK> isn't his best work thats either the diabolical dr z or <UNK> <UNK> but it has many of his <UNK> that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into his large <UNK> he combines the erotic <UNK> between showing full frontal nudity and leaving somethings left to the imagination and the surreal <UNK> this is a very <UNK> film full of great atmosphere i particularly liked the constant <UNK> despite coming off as being incredibly pretentious its amusing to hear all of <UNK> influences br br still there are many users who don't like <UNK> and i can see where they're coming from its <UNK> paced but i can deal with that more <UNK> is the <UNK> the script here was obviously rushed and within five minutes into the film i had absolutely no idea what was going on and it never really came together from that point on those who want some substance with their style look elsewhere also if its a horror film it never really becomes scary or even suspenseful still i was entertained by all the psychedelic silliness that i didn't really mind these major flaws all too much 7 10
<START> intense actors like bruce dern jason patrick and rachel ward combine to make this modern day film noir a winner of the three i don't know who was most interesting as all offer good performances and intriguing characters br br <UNK> does the narration in this noir playing an ex boxer and mental patient wow that alone makes for an interesting guy he looks dumb but he isn't ward is the <UNK> attractive cynical intelligent and compassionate co <UNK> of a kidnapping plan that goes bad bruce dern also is in the mix and dern never fails to <UNK> in about any film br br the movie could be considered kind of <UNK> to the average viewer but i found it fascinating and i don't like depressing movies normally what i found was a kind of quirky crime film take a look and see if you agree this is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well done
<START> a stage company cast finds themselves terrified when a bizarre killer known as 'the <UNK> targets them for death a pair of <UNK> and their clumsy photographer set out to work the story of 'the <UNK> and find themselves targets as well just as you think our trio of heroes has the case solved you're thrown another twist that has you wondering who the killer really is according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br taking the <UNK> of <UNK> dame to hollywood producer sam <UNK> lack of studio settings probably helps a face in the fog look interesting especially toward the end 1930s traffic the direction could be improved upon for example the camera angle on the fight scene is not helpful the budget appears slight under the circumstances most of the silent <UNK> <UNK> cast perform it <UNK> br br a face in the fog 2 1 <UNK> robert f hill lloyd hughes june <UNK> al st john
<START> the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest but throughout watching this film we were saying <UNK> these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations the lighting is good makeup and hair are good why is the sound so bad throughout the film the sound was <UNK> <UNK> and much of the dialog was <UNK> br br there is some good acting in this film and i think jim <UNK> is really a good actor this story with some of the same actors would have been worth doing as a high budget film br br i just can't <UNK> enough if you have a limited budget <UNK> more to good sound sound is as much a part of a film as the image and it's worth doing right could've earned a 6
<START> i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary the musical score cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an <UNK> production even though it is shot for those huge <UNK> theaters it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system in fact this would make a perfect dvd to <UNK> your system br br the subject is also so fascinating it is about mario <UNK> and his son michael i was already a fan of mario because he is the best <UNK> drive in history since he is the only person to win the <UNK> championship <UNK> championship the <UNK> 500 and the <UNK> 500 the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first <UNK> that mario ever drove and we follow <UNK> to <UNK> perfection the other car is michael's new <UNK> and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season <UNK> lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating br br paul newman who was michael <UNK> team owner at the time this movie was made <UNK> the film his <UNK> and <UNK> drawn from many years as an owner and driver lends much to the production br br the main feature is the race scenes turn up the volume here there is something about riding along at over 200 <UNK> and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget wow br br the final magical element is the humanity of the <UNK> family this god of the racing world mario <UNK> is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career they work together so well that every father and son should see this you can tell that they are a close family i wish we could all have that experience
<START> crazed shotgun <UNK> incest driven revenge seeking truck drivers obsessive control disorder daddy raped me when i was 12 <UNK> carrying all <UNK> wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station ie <UNK> at <UNK> on sunday nights <UNK> yes i know that was an entire sentence but bare with me people this is a long <UNK> review for a short pointless film br br filmed in somewhere canada with almost no budget the plot to this freak show is trite the police in it obviously never heard of state <UNK> because they end up chasing both <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> idiotic <UNK> <UNK> generic insecure college student all across the u s and i thought only the fbi could do that the camera is shaky the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like <UNK> and leonard part 6 br br as far as the skin scenes go which is the only reason to even rent this movie don't even think of buying it there are two of them the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the <UNK> sex scene with <UNK> <UNK> and insert unknown actor here he's obviously done nothing else worth noting in a seedy disgusting motel room the kind with the <UNK> sink that <UNK> and the <UNK> machine outside that only has blue <UNK> water left in it it's all s m riding <UNK> <UNK> hot wax and underwear <UNK> folks and in the end he gets left in a motel room with no money and cops waiting at his door that's goes to show you guys don't let a hooker tie you up in a middle of nowhere motel room sadly though <UNK> shows no skin worth remembering and that alone can cause deep <UNK> traumatic experiences for some gentlemen so that is definitely a <UNK> towards this flick br br as for the ending <UNK> <UNK> i know you probably wouldn't mind if i revealed it to you but i won't you should spend your hard earned money for that one all in all i give it a 1 5 for action a 3 5 for skin see last paragraph and a 0 0 for acting character development or intricate plot twists br br laughing man
<START> pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time if the murderer wanted to <UNK> the dame why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out <UNK> involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous not to mention all the mouths you'd have to worry about staying shut why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word are there really cops out there who are wise cracking <UNK> popping <UNK> apes who approach a suspect in such a <UNK> manner this probably played well back before the wheel was invented but it is so corny and unbelievable today catch the manic drum break by elisha cook his frenetic <UNK> never once matched the recording his mad facial expressions made up for the off <UNK> stick sync
<START> even in the 21st century child bearing is dangerous women have <UNK> and give birth <UNK> <UNK> five years ago it was not <UNK> for women to die during <UNK> that is the theme of life begins a look at the difficult cases ward of a <UNK> hospital loretta young plays the lead a woman brought here from prison what crime she committed is not <UNK> to the plot to give birth she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth she's in a ward with several other women who share their <UNK> and pain with each other br br although loretta young is the lead the outstanding performance as usual is put in by glenda farrell farrell was one of <UNK> b women in the 1930s showing up quite a bit in supporting roles and sometimes getting the lead in b movies farrell played <UNK> <UNK> in several <UNK> of the <UNK> b movie series here farrell plays an <UNK> mother who doesn't want her children since they'll only get in the way she does everything she can to get in the way of the <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> into the ward this of course during the <UNK> days and drinking like a fish apparently they'd never heard of <UNK> alcohol syndrome back in the 30s br br interestingly unlike most movie of the early 1930s it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men that situation is <UNK> with the <UNK> fathers being <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> watch for veteran character actor frank <UNK> as one of the <UNK> fathers life begins being an early <UNK> treats the subject with a fair <UNK> of melodrama to be sure but it's quite a charming little movie turner classic show it albeit <UNK> i've only seen it show up on a few days <UNK> loretta young but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up
<START> this was a very thought provoking film especially for 1973 at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten but its central messages were too important to disappear completely it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time no one had ever heard of the <UNK> <UNK> 1985 and the controversial subject of <UNK> was rarely brought up br br the sets and special effects might look a little outdated but big money for sci fi films was a <UNK> in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie not for <UNK> out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought <UNK> unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions br br this was also <UNK> last good film the end of his famous <UNK> sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made and the ending might be creepy and depressing but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this
<START> blue monkey 1987 or <UNK> of the <UNK> as it's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a <UNK> by some mysterious toxic plant the man gets rushed to hospital where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth of course this transforms into this <UNK> monster and proceeds to go on the rampage despite steve <UNK> and john <UNK> being in the movie i found it to be boring with a flat predictable storyline un interesting characters cheap special effects and lack of action horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down you wont be missing much trust me i give this movie 2 10
<START> i was very pleased to go and see a <UNK> film shot in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately <UNK> in a film the <UNK> philosophy br br film tells the story of a standard in career <UNK> couple starting from the birth to the death the birth wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love life is hard in the <UNK> of <UNK> and after the <UNK> old days became <UNK> and <UNK> then finally the product a child who instead of <UNK> further the couple relationship it <UNK> because the selfish effect typical of a nowadays metropolis personality the advertising environment with all the creative under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the <UNK> <UNK> director br br the actors are well chosen <UNK> <UNK> nice and well <UNK> and a positive surprise an unexpected good <UNK> <UNK> well known by the trash tv <UNK> le <UNK> br br rating 7 10
<START> absolutely horrific film <UNK> and it isn't funny at all lead character played by <UNK> ali <UNK> is very annoying edits by e t and star wars is just plain stupid br br actor <UNK> <UNK> is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than <UNK> this movie is a garbage br br director <UNK> <UNK> is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date br br music of <UNK> <UNK> is another plus of this waste of money actor <UNK> <UNK> also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
<START> what can i say that hasn't been said about the haunting it has everything that would make a great picture wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometimes <UNK> the mind in such a weird <UNK> way the entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand <UNK> taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her but that's about it all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more a lot more
<START> this was on at 2 or so in the morning one saturday a few years ago for various reasons i don't remember the entire story but what remains are the two standout performances from the central characters dom has had a unfortunate lot manipulated literally working a rubbish job eugene torn between personal aspirations and duty towards his sibling tom <UNK> dom doesn't <UNK> for sympathy it comes naturally ray liotta is a universe away from henry hill displaying a soft centre in what must feel a <UNK> position br br in many ways this deals with the dilemma many young <UNK> face the past or the future as it turns out with some work the two can happily co exist <UNK> handled <UNK> played dominick eugene is difficult not to warm to
<START> we purchased this series on dvd because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here i gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting directing and writing are brilliant in fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being <UNK> so smoothly on the series if one watches it with <UNK> one will see the entire <UNK> of the radical right wing beliefs being <UNK> by the fox faux news network to avoid giving away any spoilers i will <UNK> from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances a brief look at the plots found here on imdb will <UNK> that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide <UNK> and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and <UNK> speeches given by some of the best actors in the world we watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using attorney general <UNK> as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us the series also manages to <UNK> male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices depicting evil people all in all the complete <UNK> of the radical religious right wing br br no doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that america lost its way in the early part of the this century as a student of history myself i would <UNK> this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by <UNK> for hitler and some of the propaganda produced by hollywood for the american audience during wwii br br so if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so just be sure to purchase an <UNK> used copy so you can avoid <UNK> the ultra right <UNK> at faux network who produced this travesty
<START> i have seen a couple movies on eating <UNK> but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating <UNK> towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character <UNK> doesn't automatically just get better she gets better and then has a <UNK> i think this movie shows more than the others that i've seen that getting better doesn't just happen it's hard work and takes time it's a long path to <UNK> i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
<START> first off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a james bond effect what i mean is that while the new casino <UNK> takes place in 2006 it is <UNK> the first adventure of <UNK> dr no <UNK> being the second while in golden eye the first film with pierce brosnan <UNK> <UNK> is referred to as the new replacement for the male m so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double 0 aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older this is more or less a poetic license to thrill we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained no the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive <UNK> of the original series from nearly half a century ago in the 1960's <UNK> were fantasy now we call them cell phones and there were <UNK> <UNK> instead of buttons <UNK> do you think 400 years from now they would have <UNK> <UNK> for jean luc <UNK> so please let's give the producers some <UNK> br br but to try and make things a bit consistent let us just <UNK> about the <UNK> creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica if that is the case where did all the <UNK> that populated the original earth come from we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space well what happened if one of the <UNK> ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a <UNK> or whatever and one ship loaded with human looking <UNK> wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one they <UNK> it found out they could <UNK> it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a <UNK> fleet to search for the legendary caprica only to find a <UNK> but <UNK> planet which they <UNK> to become the humans who eventually invented the <UNK> time <UNK> of course which came first the chicken or the road who cares it's <UNK> entertaining
<START> although john <UNK> hard boiled is my number 1 favorite movie but i have to say police story is my number 2 favorite movie i say this because the stunts the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when jackie chan jumps off the <UNK> at the top of the <UNK> at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with <UNK> lights and <UNK> down the pole fell through a <UNK> and finally land on his back on the hard <UNK> floor <UNK> buy it at amazon com for 14 98 or something in 14 dollars vhs new line home video any questions or comments please feel free to <UNK> i'm only 14 but i know where you can find any movie ever made if you looking everywhere for a movie and can't find it please <UNK> to me thank you and good night
<START> something happens to sondra <UNK> when she enters the <UNK> box on the stage of a london theater little does sondra know the spirit of newly <UNK> journalist joe <UNK> <UNK> to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him on his voyage to another dimension is the infamous <UNK> killer that has been on a <UNK> of crime in london the only problem is the man accused is for all appearances a respectable upper class man br br when sondra tells her experience to the great <UNK> who is a k a sid <UNK> the magician is stunned but decides to go along the two would be p i s <UNK> an <UNK> to a club where peter <UNK> goes to swim sondra who <UNK> she is drowning catches the attention of this hunk who wants to see more of her br br needless to say the two of them will get into all kinds of funny situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the film little does the real <UNK> killer think he can fool a <UNK> sondra who proves herself to be more <UNK> than he gave her credit for br br the result is a perfect summer film with a lot of laughs that is just what one needs to get out of the heat into a perfect time in a cool theater woody allen has done better and yet this sunny comedy will <UNK> him for past failures in scoop mr allen has taken himself from the romantic lead <UNK> his gorgeous leading lady his trade mark <UNK> is something this funny man will never get rid of since it appears to be his trade mark the film has some funny one liners that will go over the head of the viewers that might not be paying attention br br scarlett johansson the beautiful star of scoop seems to be the perfect foil for woody allen she plays the straight part while mr allen does his <UNK> a perfect combination both are excellent in their banter throughout the film ms johansson is a <UNK> beauty in her red bathing suit although they have dressed her so <UNK> in most of the costumes she wears on the screen hugh jackman is seen as peter <UNK> a sophisticated man about town with the right <UNK> he makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing ms johansson ian <UNK> plays the dead fleet street journalist on his way to eternity br br scoop is a light film for the hot and <UNK> summer thanks to woody allen
<START> mr <UNK> took a good idea and kicked like a football unfortunately it didn't make the goal the historical subject of giants is a good one but pour in the <UNK> milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese i say take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff i couldn't even watch the entire film that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie i always like to give them a chance for last minute redemption it's impossible to redeem something this bad well at least the acting was good not br br the only thing falling in this film is the rating 1 10 and sinking into the negative numbers
<START> i enjoyed the previous <UNK> movie that i'd seen burning moon but while that movie was rather grim and nasty <UNK> seems to mostly play it for laughs while its admirable how <UNK> made this movie with no money in his spare time and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this i found myself constantly battling not to fast forward to the next gore scene sure there's gore and if that's all you want then go ahead and enjoy but be warned there's an <UNK> amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition many are comparing this to peter jackson's movies especially <UNK> but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in bad taste it's clear <UNK> is lacking one thing that jackson has talent 3 10 for pretty good and <UNK> gore effects and for getting the most out of limited resources but not worth the money i paid for it
<START> curiously season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts based on this outing for the man in the mac and also fade into murder br br furthermore it is not a coincidence that peter s <UNK> penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here br br this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look <UNK> with the material the story is rather <UNK> developed with some <UNK> periods of boring conversation br br columbo is also <UNK> by a colleague here similar to last <UNK> to the <UNK> but the entertainment value is minimal to add to this <UNK> <UNK> characterisation which is intended to provide comedy <UNK> embarrassment rather than laughs br br the script <UNK> off to deal with the family history and the <UNK> does enough to gift columbo the case though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime br br ironically what turns out to be arguably <UNK> worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series he <UNK> a male <UNK> and has a <UNK> <UNK> at the same time the next 5 minutes are hilarious it's just that <UNK> hair is so perfectly <UNK> then he can't afford to pay the bill and then when he makes <UNK> at a <UNK> he keeps <UNK> in the mirror to admire his <UNK> br br sadly this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been <UNK> together in ten minutes br br for columbo <UNK> only
<START> though i really didn't feel anything for <UNK> character and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development perhaps with lance i would have liked it better br br however i have to completely agree with <UNK> when they said and to quote glenn <UNK> character ben <UNK> the star here in it that's right i'm the talented one ' if you watch the movie just watch him even when he's in the background just his facial expressions all in the eyes you know for sure what <UNK> ben exactly how he feels about comments even if it's a quick look behind a character's back great acting in a fair film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> 8 br br oh um excuse me sorry fell asleep there for a <UNK> now where was i oh yes the projected man yes <UNK> 8 br br <UNK> sorry yes the projected man well it's a british sci fi <UNK> about nothing some orange headed guy projects himself on a laser gets the touch of death at last he <UNK> the end actually the film's not even that interesting dull <UNK> <UNK> stiff and back <UNK> boring the projected man is <UNK> solid minutes of nothing starring nobody dull as <UNK> dull as <UNK> dust dull as ethan hawke we're talking really dull here people but wait in respect to our dull cousins from across the <UNK> the <UNK> will now do a proper review for the projected man br br <UNK> 8
<START> having seen and loved greg <UNK> most recent film <UNK> he co wrote and directed that feature as well i decided to check out his earlier work and this movie was well worth the effort and rental <UNK> in manhattan is a tongue in cheek excellent take on the shakespeare favorite updated and moved to nyc i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was <UNK> by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself and very cleverly at that the trials and <UNK> of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around <UNK> castle mr <UNK> obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories <UNK> is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty something new <UNK> set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood with manhattan <UNK> and a downtown <UNK> thrown in for good measure and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare the movie is well paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of <UNK> it reminded me of al <UNK> looking for richard another wonderful shakespeare play within a movie i highly recommend checking out <UNK> in manhattan
<START> this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies it's about two guys that wish that the world would go away and that's exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not predictable and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic <UNK> i actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits trust me on this one enjoy the movie
<START> this is not a children's movie br br this movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of 5 for a month my 4 year old from time to time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the <UNK> bury all the <UNK> and that wasn't the worst of it we stopped it about a 1 2 hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing <UNK> decided this movie should be <UNK> to children should be brought up on charges go ahead <UNK> me my conscience is clear
<START> this movie had so much potential anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it's ridiculous too much time and effort was spent in the movie on <UNK> homosexual <UNK> and his alcohol <UNK> where was the character development the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception where in the movie does it address his <UNK> when he began killing and <UNK> small animals instead we are giving a <UNK> array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in <UNK> development also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details how he <UNK> the bodies in his apartment and the <UNK> and <UNK> he went to to accomplish this his <UNK> and his desire for flesh etc i could go on but to sum up too many <UNK> points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is dahmer
<START> will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his <UNK> to right his <UNK> in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts writer grant <UNK> and italian director <UNK> <UNK> come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching feeling this film i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character irs agent ben thomas he played in this film you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger the <UNK> over his love for emily played by rosario dawson who by the way was fantastic as usual i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love woody <UNK> also stars in this top notch film i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points all i can say is watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to <UNK> you take the phone off the hook sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas i thank you will smith for another great film
<START> the shame of it there i was comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn <UNK> in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment what did i get disappointed how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this the humour was dreadful the songs were worse than country and western and that's saying something and the plot was as confused and poor as blind <UNK> i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island a short tale such as christmas carol is perfect because you can <UNK> the muppet high <UNK> around it here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun where do the muppets go next how about muppets wizard of oz
<START> noting the cast i recently watched this movie on tcm hoping for an under appreciated gem as i regard many films from the 30's this is no gem not even semi precious the <UNK> clothing and 1930's rolls <UNK> <UNK> hit you immediately the casting is strange also but mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices this film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the <UNK> aren't mixed according to the right recipe it simply doesn't come together like it should and that's a shame with a few rather obvious but minor <UNK> this might have been a very good movie br br the film is about an american <UNK> jean harlow seeking a rich british husband preferably from the <UNK> she meets <UNK> tone and his buddy who are on a <UNK> in a rolls <UNK> owned by his <UNK> <UNK> harlow <UNK> assumes tone is the lord who owns the rolls and she sets her sights on him this early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction br br however tone <UNK> <UNK> the fact that his <UNK> is actually a german <UNK> <UNK> on the eve of wwi and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart tone and harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is <UNK> down by a <UNK> <UNK> type <UNK> <UNK> and harlow <UNK> the scene with a <UNK> <UNK> her of <UNK> murder in fact tone <UNK> from the wounds br br harlow <UNK> to france where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy french <UNK> cary grant tone now in the army and harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in <UNK> hospital room where he is in <UNK> from a plane crash in the following scene tone <UNK> harlow of <UNK> him because she is essentially a gold <UNK> harlow never explains about the <UNK> <UNK> her of murder and her panic that is one of those unreal movie plot device break downs in the story br br then tone is also brought back into contact with the woman <UNK> who shot him she is on hand to watch her <UNK> grant test the new plane that tone has delivered to him from england incredibly both <UNK> and tone <UNK> recognize each other but simply can't place where from okay so tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of <UNK> but how many men did <UNK> shoot that she would forget one of her marks she does not seem to be <UNK> the memory <UNK> br br this is inexplicable and unnecessary <UNK> should have absolutely recognized him but played it <UNK> when she realized that tone wasn't able to place her that would have been a much better treatment of that issue br br the finale also is very unsatisfying the movie as made has tone and harlow <UNK> to <UNK> the good reputation of the <UNK> grant leading to his <UNK> burial as a hero then harlow and tone just walk away it is noble to <UNK> the french <UNK> perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story br br what the film begs for is this harlow explains that she <UNK> in a panic in the face of <UNK> of murder tone <UNK> her and quietly <UNK> his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to <UNK> the crash site to <UNK> <UNK> reputation meanwhile harlow finally <UNK> grant for the <UNK> he is then having seen tone for the brave and noble man he is harlow <UNK> feelings for him too at film's end the two of them become <UNK> even as they work together to <UNK> the appearance of <UNK> death after <UNK> hero's burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade out that would have made a nice little movie for cary grant fans it would have been even better had tone played the french <UNK> who is killed and grant the long suffering first husband reunited with harlow br br it is incomprehensible that <UNK> tone is cast as the <UNK> living in england while cary grant is cast as the frenchman this movie would have been much better had they <UNK> roles that also would have been more <UNK> to the film that should have been
<START> some good movies keep you in front of the tv and you are dying to see the result br br this movie does not have <UNK> and <UNK> it simply describes a young girl's family life in africa people come and go the weather and the background are all the same br br
<START> the latest film by the spanish director <UNK> <UNK> is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental <UNK> whether these tools are religion followed to a <UNK> level caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male prostitute <UNK> creates a successful examination of how these <UNK> affect three teenagers living in spain under franco the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers <UNK> corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form <UNK> br br the cinematic style of the text is typically visually <UNK> as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work with themes dealing with sexual desire both <UNK> and homosexual an element that is different between the two directors is that <UNK> <UNK> a supernatural <UNK> spliced with claustrophobic gritty realism opposed to <UNK> use of <UNK> although both styles are similar br br the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing
<START> what a waste of time and money my <UNK> and i saw this movie after seeing the previews and thinking it might be funny wrong this movie is about 90 minutes too long the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out the jokes are weak and tired and not even seeing <UNK> naked behind can redeem any part of this film the special effects aren't i half expected to see the <UNK> and <UNK> holding up uma in her flying scenes and when the effects people apparently could not master the <UNK> faster than a <UNK> bullet flying or fight scenes they covered over everything with a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> screen which <UNK> the awful effects quite nicely <UNK> sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co worker the sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny i guess i just expected too much from these actors none of the characters were really sympathetic so i ended up not caring a flying <UNK> about any of them the only memorable performances were the kids who played <UNK> and g girl as teenagers at least they had some chemistry overall a super <UNK> movie i wouldn't even recommend it as a rental it would still be a waste of money
<START> the british horror film was in <UNK> decline by the start of the seventies but out of the <UNK> came three films that were among the best our island produced the <UNK> blood on <UNK> claw and the house that <UNK> blood made the future seem <UNK> even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one <UNK> has the sort of cast that could easily form a <UNK> if it hadn't actually been assembled in the bleak <UNK> of 2008 you may well find yourself expecting to wake up <UNK> is the most overlooked of the four stories and is naturally my favourite <UNK> life and art are <UNK> so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle sensitive man death and the maiden rip peter
<START> the fact that there are positive comments about dan in real life on the imdb just makes me realize that their <UNK> staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film br br i have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film i sat through last night dan in real life <UNK> characters in previous films led me to believe that i would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters i felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast br br the dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter <UNK> family and the film has been so many times before that i am shocked someone thought it was an original idea br br do yourself a favor and take a pass on this <UNK> bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the imdb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a good film
<START> in 1993 with the success of the first season of batman the animated series warner brothers <UNK> the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie originally <UNK> for direct to video but <UNK> up to theatrical status it would become known as batman mask of the phantasm ten years after phantasm we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb sub zero return of the joker and now mystery of the batwoman joins the family br br the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm a new female vigilante <UNK> herself after batman has begun <UNK> <UNK> run by <UNK> mob boss rupert <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> aka the penguin now batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line br br the animation is the <UNK> futuristic style that was <UNK> for batman the animated <UNK> fifth and sixth seasons aka the new batman adventures it's quite nicely done and just as <UNK> as return of the <UNK> animation there is also some use of cgi but it's minor compared to the <UNK> of it in sub zero the music was alright different and exotic and similar to the justice league score although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older <UNK> <UNK> shaped hearts br br kevin <UNK> as always does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman it's also great to have the old batman the animated series <UNK> back that includes bob <UNK> <UNK> gordon robert <UNK> detective <UNK> tara strong barbara gordon <UNK> her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond and <UNK> <UNK> jr alfred br br villains were also great especially given that rupert <UNK> the old mob boss from the original series appears for the first time since the fourth season br br overall while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago <UNK> carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan you will love the five minute short chase me
<START> i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other people's opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear i'm amazed there weren't any group hug moments br br i think i jumped once and that's because i <UNK> out thinking about my research paper for english the clichéd birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen br br and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my mom's <UNK> you idiot screw the <UNK> safety is just a few steps away but no my mom's <UNK> that didn't match the dress by the way is <UNK> more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived god br br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet he's hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the <UNK> clothes and <UNK> out of the hotel and it's the detective coming down the <UNK> not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies aren't even this predictable br br i'm gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie i'm glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn't buy it for 15 00 and then hate it it was just bad it would've been better if only one thing would've happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that would've been br br don't waste your time or money go see a good movie
<START> when sam <UNK> <UNK> the wild bunch 1969 opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra violence it did so with a talented if <UNK> <UNK> hand <UNK> the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth but in no time flat there were scores of <UNK> that fell far from the <UNK> set by <UNK> epic and soldier blue definitely falls into that category br br soldier blew er blue tells the story of foul mouthed new <UNK> <UNK> lee <UNK> <UNK> a blonde <UNK> hippie chick who's been rescued from two years of <UNK> among the <UNK> and is now being sent to a <UNK> where she'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money also on board the <UNK> she's traveling in is a <UNK> of government gold cash the <UNK> need to buy guns with so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and <UNK> <UNK> to the hills accompanied by <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> the lone surviving <UNK> calling <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> soldier blue <UNK> demonstrates that her years among the <UNK> was time well spent <UNK> <UNK> in survival skills common sense and sheer balls and over their journey toward the <UNK> they must <UNK> against the elements a band of hostile <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK>  played by donald <UNK> here giving one of his most ridiculous performances and that's saying something  and in the tradition of many previous western set romantic comedies each other br br during the course of their <UNK> the two <UNK> are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while <UNK> has a <UNK> treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile <UNK> that wasn't filled with <UNK> mountain lions or who knows what to say nothing of the <UNK> who could have done something really <UNK> with such a <UNK> apartment there i go thinking in nyc real estate terms again br br realizing that their love could never <UNK> outside of the cave <UNK> leaves <UNK> and makes it to the <UNK> by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue <UNK> the <UNK> needs all available <UNK> to launch an attack on the nearby <UNK> village and once <UNK> gets wind of that she slips past her <UNK> horny <UNK> to be and makes a <UNK> straight to the <UNK> to warn them of what's coming br br what happens next is what gained the film its <UNK> it turns out that all the wacky <UNK> and <UNK> were all just a lead in to a hideous <UNK> of the <UNK> sand creek massacre an orgy of rape torture and general sadistic evil <UNK> in the name of keeping the country clean and almost forty years after its release this sequence still <UNK> and <UNK> for its sheer cruelty children are <UNK> beneath the <UNK> of <UNK> horses or <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> people are <UNK>  a nice effect i have to admit  women are stripped and <UNK> by gangs of <UNK> <UNK> then raped and <UNK>  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to <UNK> some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> parts <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> about in <UNK> celebration or kept as the most <UNK> of <UNK> no joke this scene would instantly garner an <UNK> 17 rating if released today to say nothing of possibly <UNK> native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted br br i'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won or stolen if truth be told but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be one minute it's a heavy handed pseudo <UNK> lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally <UNK> up well duh then it's a light hearted battle of the <UNK> farce <UNK> <UNK> proves herself five times the man <UNK> is and manages to look hot in her tasty red <UNK> <UNK> with no <UNK> but that all goes out the window when donald <UNK> shows up with an unintentionally hilarious pair of buck <UNK> <UNK> and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous <UNK> in a sub plot that goes nowhere all of which <UNK> in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax any one of those <UNK> would have been okay for a coherent film but the end result is a <UNK> mess that <UNK> the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery br br but by trying to be all things to all audiences soldier blue ends up as an incoherent preachy <UNK> <UNK> of presumably well <UNK> political correctness but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk <UNK> with murphy brown acting as their <UNK> we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass <UNK> to lure <UNK> <UNK> into seeing the most savage film in history if you like me were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its daring to tell it like it was take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity
<START> i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the <UNK> wife i am not sure of her character's name i went to <UNK> with her and lost touch with her her maiden name was kim luke and i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tear <UNK> on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of <UNK> more like <UNK> with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final <UNK> something like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the way thanks melissa <UNK>
<START> if my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy a funny look at the adult entertainment industry if that's what it's supposed to be it doesn't really work it just isn't that funny setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy failure aside since i have no personal knowledge of the subject matter i'll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a toronto <UNK> <UNK> except to say that if this is true the life is pretty dull br br for over an hour this movie really doesn't give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters conrad is the newly hired manager of the <UNK> <UNK> whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren't giving full service a <UNK> for actual sex as for the girls themselves <UNK> goal is to buy a <UNK> of her own so that she can run her own business cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and <UNK> is well <UNK> is a somewhat strange <UNK> character with a <UNK> fetish true who seems to be in the business because well because she's in it i have no idea what her character was about those three may well fairly reasonable <UNK> characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business br br the movie <UNK> about and doesn't offer much until the twist reveals conrad to be the bad guy we should have gotten to that point sooner the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story <UNK> secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls that plan for revenge was pretty good and you're grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you're wondering why you wasted your time with this had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been a fairly funny movie br br the performances from the 4 leads were all ok although i didn't think anyone came across as outstanding all four characters were a bit shallow cindy was a sympathetic character and so was conrad for a while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie given the subject matter there's surprisingly little nudity and what there is is <UNK> to one scene in fact there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this as for the overall quality of the movie it's a low budget effort which shows although you expect a certain <UNK> i suppose of a movie set in the context of a body rub <UNK> so that's forgivable it certainly says something though that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer director <UNK> <UNK> resume and given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry that it wasn't even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards the canadian version of the oscars 4 10 and i'm being a bit generous with that
<START> i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who <UNK> movies with typical characters of dumb <UNK> romantic interest or damsel in danger but everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l a <UNK> and i think i was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance however after that moment her career did not follow the ideal path sure the <UNK> she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately <UNK> movies like people i know or the door in the floor but we have never seen her again on a substantial character the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation and it is not only that her character is not too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy the screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic however basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points this movie is full of clichés and generic villains the work of director susan <UNK> is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous i do not recommend while she was out at all this film commits the capital sin of being boring
<START> let's cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true <UNK> nights style there's an evil magician a pretty princess a <UNK> and everybody lives happily ever after modern <UNK> sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only <UNK> the special effects are pretty dated loved <UNK> with the <UNK> foot though
<START> <UNK> vocal performance was outstanding <UNK> played the female singer role while richard was in the club when she first step out on stage and started to riff and <UNK> her stuff it made my soul shake her voice is <UNK> she needs to make a cd she has more fans then she realizes i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beats which she also starred with leon when she was younger how can a little girl have a voice so big she is truly amazing good voice good good good good voice voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice back shaking tear crying uplifting take you back in the days voice <UNK> if you read this commit please take my advice and start recording a cd if not just for the love of singing but for your fans i believe you can truly make it look at these other one hit single studio singers lol
<START> this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad unfortunate death at the box office i saw this film at a local art cinema in revival form shortly after it <UNK> in mainstream cinemas it certainly deserves to be approached a second time or even a third sandra b takes it to the limit by doing spoken word taking on some well known songs in this piece her version of hank <UNK> <UNK> so <UNK> i could <UNK> could easily move you to tears maybe someday audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously but not without some well placed laughs too the film moves at a <UNK> pace thanks to some nice editing so that some viewers will not find it stale boring perhaps a revival is just down the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> alexander knox stands trial for nazi crimes three witnesses give evidence father <UNK> henry <UNK> <UNK> brother karl <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> former lover <UNK> <UNK> hunt before <UNK> speaks in his own defense the film ends after the court sums up br br the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna shirley mills who <UNK> is accused of <UNK> the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps and the church service where willie <UNK> richard <UNK> <UNK> his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend <UNK> dorothy morris <UNK> daughter after she has been shot at a <UNK> br br throughout the film knox is <UNK> and is very convincing as a bitter <UNK> and evil man martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry <UNK> is also very good in his role as a priest this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished
<START> simply i found the tv show mash trite preachy oh ever so politically correct <UNK> pretentious and biggest sin of all and that is that it is was incredibly dull you have alan <UNK> as the main lead star who is so in love with himself and his <UNK> that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try and sit through an episode the original series had both <UNK> <UNK> and wayne rogers whom i'll happily admit had a certain <UNK> and style to their character presentation however harry henry morgan and mike farrell both <UNK> and <UNK> together is like eating <UNK> and fresh <UNK> with wonder bread loretta <UNK> which i also found dull also to no fault of her own wasn't a wonder to look at and gary <UNK> who was good in the movie got tired looking and acting as the show wore on seeing one show a year showed that to me jamie <UNK> was just low brow comedy and is not even worth really mentioning here at all the reason i did not give it a one rating which anyone reading this by now would be wondering is that ratings of any sort is not only a <UNK> call but a relative one television except for relatively few exceptions is such <UNK> that relatively speaking mash had some production quality by television standards of that era and today and therefore it is deserved of a two rob ritter
<START> no i'm not kidding if they ever <UNK> a movie idea they should be kicked out of the studio i'm serious their movies are exactly the same in every one and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations having a problem which they easily resolve hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends think about it if you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot contact me and tell me its name these movies are poor excuses to be on tv and go to other countries there is a reason that the movies never go to theaters i'm sure that when they were really young and made some o k movies some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years or something so that now that they're what 17 they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the <UNK> money let me advise you stay away from mary kate and ashley it's for your own good
<START> i am embarrassed to say that i missed the mother when it was in theaters i saw it this evening on dvd i gave it a 10 vote one of the very few i have given here this english independent is filmed with such great care and quality it drew me in relentlessly the story low <UNK> and purely human is brutally honest and utterly absorbing thanks to the acting of anne reid daniel craig and <UNK> <UNK> the cinematography is stunning the score is hard <UNK> to the plot the storyline is epic brilliantly <UNK> by writer <UNK> <UNK> in mundane lives this story <UNK> big issues with the subtlety of an <UNK> painting and some of those big issues are highly controversial which probably explains the lack of awards won despite many nominations it is simply one of my all time favorite films
<START> i first saw this film in 1980 in the <UNK> movie spot after many subsequent viewings and purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out loud br br yes it's a <UNK> of another age a domestic comedy set in <UNK> middle class america but well executed is well executed but it's also a document of its age a celebration of post war optimism the baby boom and the <UNK> <UNK> age this film is no guilty pleasure br br three wonderful sophisticated leads actors <UNK> melvyn douglas <UNK> cary grant <UNK> determined myrna loy <UNK> each other and a memorable team of characters br br my favourite scenes it means we gotta blast and miss <UNK> and this little <UNK> br br love it
<START> it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing the first joke was just so <UNK> lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go you shouldn't really decide to watch this based on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldn't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was <UNK> at us paying money to see it br br couldn't they have just made earnest does dallas
<START> this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to <UNK> by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find <UNK> in his music drawing on <UNK> traits of keeping things within <UNK> and of the <UNK> character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united states br br if you can see it
<START> apparently <UNK> <UNK> figured out early on that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously so he decided to camp it up the result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword and <UNK> epic or as a very entertaining comedy and i think i'll go the second way the brief gore moments are well done the paul brothers openly mock the material they even <UNK> at each other in one scene and there is also a charming spirited good natured performance by eva la <UNK> as the girl who <UNK> along with the boys plus where else can you see the <UNK> of a dragon <UNK> like a <UNK>
<START> the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world wide chaos as flesh eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror it's not even thrilling just ridiculous even the <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> and ollie will give you more excitement it's like watching a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more <UNK> the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping mall to avoid being eaten by the <UNK> outside are not better either even though they doesn't seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this
<START> this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school watching as the <UNK> <UNK> un <UNK> around him br br the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of <UNK> then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic new <UNK> a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously as he and the driver approach a road block he plays around with his drivers i d not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him suddenly realizes that every <UNK> including his driver is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help the media cameras cannot stop <UNK> and there's too many <UNK> wielding <UNK> men too shoot the title comes from the <UNK> captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead bodies around his compound but won't shoot the <UNK> men that are killing people around the compound mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet finally he realizes the <UNK> of the situation and the guy who tells the <UNK> team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims <UNK> with his tail in between his legs rather than face <UNK> death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind br br it's more of character study and a come to jesus moment for one character than a story about the <UNK> in <UNK> this movie didn't have to take place in <UNK> it could have taken place any one of the <UNK> hell holes going around this world at any given time
<START> probably the worst dolph film ever there's nothing you'd want or expect here don't waste your time dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life his brother gets killed and dolph tries to figure things out the character is just plain stupid and stumbles around <UNK> pointless
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br a notably bad actor getting by on his now <UNK> looks rather than any strong dramatic talent richard gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the american hollywood scene always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today but nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to dvd limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his <UNK> now br br he has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened cynical case worker earl <UNK> one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex <UNK> in one area of the us who along with his new <UNK> allison <UNK> claire danes must take to his latest case <UNK> into the <UNK> of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago br br this is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity <UNK> on material definitely not for the <UNK> or those looking for light viewing and as such it's a pretty strong compelling film <UNK> and not <UNK> by it's direct to dvd budget the only thing really pulling it back is the overly used <UNK> fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while but it's still some of the <UNK> material i've seen gere in relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on
<START> this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school <UNK> basketball team similar to goldie <UNK> <UNK> it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role and she does as about as well as the script allows i think <UNK> welch would have been a better choice but considering the film's apparent tv movie budget they probably couldn't afford her cathy lee does look great in every shot but we never get to see her completely nude the story is pretty predictable to say the least offering no surprises a young and lucky michael <UNK> has the male lead role he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee <UNK> <UNK> has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports this point is brought up throughout the film and needless to say is dated ironically cathy lee doesn't put her team through any <UNK> practice sessions she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not so bright player who <UNK> <UNK> in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney <UNK> it looks like everyone had a good time making this film but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby she's not that great an actress but she has a dazzling smile beautiful hair and a very <UNK> body
<START> the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone's face fans of run lola run <UNK> go and <UNK> will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all <UNK> the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental
<START> to a certain extent i actually liked this film better than the original vampires i found that movie to be quite misogynistic as a woman and a horror fan i'm used to the fact that women in peril are a <UNK> of the genre but they just slap <UNK> lee around way too much in this movie natasha wagner is a more fully realized character and the main bad guy is a gal <UNK> <UNK> who played a sidekick <UNK> in blade is very <UNK> and deadly jon bon <UNK> okay yeah no great actor but he does ok at least he doesn't start to sing catch it on cable if you can it's on <UNK> action this month
<START> i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been <UNK> by it i subsequently <UNK> the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a <UNK> movie double feature dvd of curtis <UNK> shelley winters films for a very <UNK> price i couldn't resist giving it a second look this has since gone out of print actually i received the dvd a few months ago but only now with <UNK> passing did i get to it thankfully this time around i was more <UNK> to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane <UNK> <UNK> with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter henry farrell br br the film offers a splendid <UNK> of 1930s depression america with its child star <UNK> and sensational murders exploited during the fake <UNK> opening it's <UNK> made kudos to <UNK> <UNK> cinematography and the set design by eugene <UNK> and boasts an effective david <UNK> score shelley winters debbie reynolds and michael <UNK> deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the larger than life and vaguely sinister <UNK> coach though he ultimately proves a mere red <UNK> also featured are dennis weaver and <UNK> <UNK> hers is only a cameo really as the <UNK> she plays is mostly heard over the radio br br many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing mae west imitation but i personally wasn't bothered by them the film does slightly <UNK> its welcome due to an <UNK> pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot reynolds a musical star herself is <UNK> cast as the dancing school owner and despite their on set rivalry she and winters work well together the latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew <UNK> <UNK> 1971 the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand <UNK> type denouement apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of <UNK> by producer martin <UNK> against <UNK> wishes in order to get a pg rating
<START> this sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 broadway revival that was such a <UNK> hit keep in mind that when burt <UNK> directed that revival he <UNK> the book <UNK> i have a feeling that this screenwriter <UNK> as much of a change from the original <UNK> version as well i played the <UNK> <UNK> jimmy smith on stage in 1974 and thought this 1 dvd would bring back memories not a chance even the anticipated delight of seeing <UNK> <UNK> young play <UNK> part was a major disappointment three songs from the play remain and are done very poorly even the classic <UNK> tea for two is done as a virtual solo the many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all and the star anna <UNK> just <UNK> herself when i feel <UNK> by spending a dollar i know the film must be bad another <UNK> mentioned the doris day version which is actually called tea for two and is about doing the stage play the original of course so those who are seeking the true no no <UNK> might find a more recognizable version there
<START> spoilers spoilers when i saw a preview for this movie i thought it was going to be <UNK> a slightly admirable storyline but as most <UNK> original movies i was left <UNK> this <UNK> family ends up driving through this deserted town to take a <UNK> and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their <UNK> and finds out they all eventually disappear the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them their are more gaps than i can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what it ends where the family gets in a car accident and get <UNK> or <UNK> or something which is never explained the next thing you know <UNK> hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused
<START> this was the worst acted movie i've ever seen in my life no really i'm not kidding all the based on a true story historical references aside there's no excuse for such bad acting it's a shame because as others have posted the sets costumes were great br br the sound track was typical asian style music although i couldn't figure out where the modern love song came in when <UNK> was lying in his bed thinking of maria i don't know who wrote sang that beautiful song but it was as if suddenly <UNK> jones was transported to the <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> blood in <UNK> was more realistic than the <UNK> <UNK> during the <UNK> n <UNK> battle scenes br br but the acting oh so painfully sad lines delivered like a bad junior high play if gary stretch had <UNK> a <UNK> costume for the county <UNK> fair he may have been more believable towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug at times i half expected him to yell out adrian or even you wanna piece of me br br favourite line when the queen says to her lover after <UNK> on the floor i'm going to have a baby he responds a child i expected her to <UNK> no jackass a chair leg duh
<START> the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people social <UNK> and <UNK> were <UNK> as people spoke out about their views racial tensions politics the vietnam war sexual <UNK> and drug use were all part of the daily fabric and the daily news this film attempted to <UNK> these historical aspects into an entertaining movie and largely succeeded br br in this film two families are followed one white one black during the first half of the film the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles unfortunately the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family admittedly there are more characters in this family and the story lines are <UNK> but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century br br on the whole the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie the movie is a work of fiction but clips of well known historical figures are used to set the time line br br i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one sided
<START> i first saw this movie on mst3k and although i laughed my <UNK> off at the jokes i don't particularly think this movie was all that bad sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget but it had a very hitchcock like plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the non mst3k version i was genuinely entertained this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake
<START> this filmed presentation of the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of <UNK> haunting poem the striking cinematography combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of <UNK> by world famous artists and michael <UNK> superb narration are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual work br br in the age of television such work as this is an <UNK> tool to <UNK> young students as well as adults to explore and to learn the value of great poetry to the best of my knowledge this kind of work is indeed rare that is <UNK> as a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic <UNK> i feel that more great epic <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> should be so translated although not a movie critic but as an avid reader of classic literature i am glad to recommend this fine production without any <UNK> whatsoever
<START> i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie what i would like to say is that <UNK> was shown at a film festival in <UNK> in november 2005 festival <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where it won the award of the audience <UNK> du <UNK> french for what affects me i liked the <UNK> <UNK> work of mr <UNK> who in my opinion portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and <UNK> in the movie very well and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie this perspective however might seem totally <UNK> to an israeli viewer but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in <UNK> judged this film with a much more <UNK> perspective i would also like to quote what mr <UNK> said when he was interviewed by a <UNK> newspaper i'm <UNK> from french <UNK> 50 years of living here and after <UNK> all this violence we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living we are like the characters in my movie <UNK> the edge of the <UNK> this is the reason why the private detective who is somehow <UNK> is the <UNK> character in the movie because he earns a living thanks to the system he takes advantage of this <UNK> this is in substance the main thing that i and the swiss public in my opinion pointed out in this movie and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the <UNK> reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor so to sum up different country different perspective but i think that this is somehow great because it <UNK> me for what affects the future of cinema that is to say that it well never be subject to a <UNK> of <UNK> way of thinking
<START> small spoilers alert br br good movie very good movie and i'm surprised to say that myself because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name <UNK> <UNK> usually means bad news most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and <UNK> this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action this movie really fascinated me good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved it really is the story that keeps you focused especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied <UNK> lights up another aspect of the famous <UNK> <UNK> story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth it explains the life of the <UNK> count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by <UNK> dead corpses in front of his castle of course that's where the reality and the based on a true story stops the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by <UNK> <UNK> br br in this movie the count <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the usa and <UNK> tons of woman and they're all pretty girls i'll give him that overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local <UNK> but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr heck it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title these two films have nothing else in common but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture check it out my humble opinion on to die for 8 5 10
<START> i have watched quite a few cold case episodes over the years beginning with season 1 episodes back in 2003 2004 and while most have been good this particular episode was not only the best of the best but has few rivals in the emmy categories though some may not agree with the story content i e the male to male romantic relationship i doubt that anyone could watch this without being deeply moved within their spirit br br the story is essentially about a case that was <UNK> based on the <UNK> from a dying drug dealer the two central actors are two police officers in the 1960's named sean coop aka the cold case victim who goes by his last name coop and his partner jimmy bruno br br in the story coop is single a vietnam war vet with a deeply troubled past jimmy however is married with children no less both are partners on the police force and form not only a friendship but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deeply and obviously <UNK> culture prevalent at that time br br the flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white with bits of color now and then <UNK> throughout examples include their red squad car the yellow <UNK> gently blowing by the window in <UNK> bedroom where <UNK> wife watched coop and jimmy drink fight and then kiss each other while being in an alcohol induced state i found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes with everything else in black and white i still have not figured out the color scheme and <UNK> br br the clearly <UNK> tension between fellow <UNK> officers and the two central actors only <UNK> the intensity of the episode one key emotional scene was when coop was confronted by his father after the <UNK> of <UNK> baby in this scene <UNK> father <UNK> who was a respected fellow officer on the force confronts coop about the rumors surrounding <UNK> relationship with jimmy one can feel sorry for coop at this point as the shame and disgrace of <UNK> father was <UNK> upon coop you are not going to disgrace our family and you're not my son either clearly <UNK> of the hostile views of same sex relationships of that era br br additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where coop and another officer go at it after coop and jimmy are labeled batman and robin <UNK> br br as for the relationship between coop and jimmy it's obvious that coop wanted more of jimmy in his life once can see the tension in <UNK> face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and kids his church and yet his <UNK> devotion to coop br br in the end jimmy walks away from coop realizing that he cannot have both coop and his family at the same time sadly coop is killed perhaps because of his relationship with jimmy but coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that reached higher up in the force br br the most moving scene in the whole episode was when coop as he sat dying from <UNK> wounds in his squad car quietly spoke his last words over his police radio to his partner jimmy we were the lucky ones don't forget that br br the soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode i enjoyed the final scene with the actor <UNK> everett playing the still <UNK> jimmy only much older by now and clearly still missing his former partner coop br br i highly recommend this episode and consider it the best it is without a doubt the most well written well acted and well done of all cold case episodes that i've ever seen
<START> i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy <UNK> movie credits excellent dark and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as <UNK> farm don't be afraid of the dark and <UNK> school for girls all lost satanic classics i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood's classic high <UNK> drifter why don't they release these great little movies especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the <UNK> dvd <UNK> at wal mart most of these flicks have a cult following so sales shouldn't be a problem
<START> i love this show it's like watching a mini movie each week the first episode was so gripping and terrifying so was part 2 of the pilot i'm definitely gonna keep <UNK> into this show this is the real survivor i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf sorry if it's not another reality show <UNK> there was once a time where there were now <UNK> yourself actual tv shows and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> copy of a law order or <UNK> blue or <UNK> series they're <UNK> out watch this yourself to form your own opinion don't take one from the <UNK> here
<START> this is so exciting after i saw la <UNK> this afternoon a short light hearted little movie i consider this one a real treat this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year it is the more amazing since it is an early <UNK> and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema it's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and bottom line it made me happy obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the <UNK> ticket the male lead was looking for but the pace is so <UNK> and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didn't even think of it twice the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers possibly the biggest comedic force of the time this is rather perfect
<START> anyone who has read my review for uwe <UNK> alone in the dark will remember that i compared the <UNK> task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out well take that <UNK> a step further with this <UNK> <UNK> trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth <UNK> without <UNK> do that and you'll have a general idea of what eli <UNK> cabin fever is all about br br i never believed any one film was capable of <UNK> the sheer <UNK> dreck that uwe boll <UNK> out as the worst film ever made but in all honesty i have to say cabin fever comes very close this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does he has created the single most annoying and convoluted <UNK> of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life how do you screw up a story like this think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters without the bad writing and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth <UNK> out for us here this script failed on so many levels with me and while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses i do know that he <UNK> the ball big time on an idea that could very well have <UNK> the horror genre br br to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it and that is one element i normally go for there really was nothing about cabin fever that i could easily recommend to anybody when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through you know the movie is sinking fast my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before <UNK> one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again
<START> movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like repetitive boring and <UNK> of all the original energy by a <UNK> of corporate <UNK> i am glad that <UNK> wasn't <UNK> as an <UNK> psycho by this p o s go back and watch the 1971 version count the things that would never be included in a modern version and thank whatever <UNK> you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else's ideas and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day
<START> its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie and it gets old telling people it's <UNK> version of spinal tap and you know im sorry i dont have any better comments but <UNK> go get the movie and watch it and then make all your friends watch it too just like im gonna
<START> this is an excellent film dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity anne reid previously best known in the uk for her tv roles including <UNK> a victoria wood scripted series on in company <UNK> workers if you're wondering gives a performance of finely judged understatement as may a late 60s <UNK> mother of two <UNK> class adults in an inner london <UNK> her husband <UNK> peter <UNK> dies on their visit to the male of the latter species bobby and we see the pair being rather casually <UNK> by bobby and his family <UNK> teacher daughter paula <UNK> <UNK> lives nearby however and the relationship between may and paula initially appears closer thus when may decides she cannot live in her own home and comes back to london she is able to stay in <UNK> house and do some child <UNK> of <UNK> more <UNK> <UNK> br br it is on <UNK> visits to <UNK> house that she <UNK> on an affair with darren a mid 30s friend of bobby who is working on a house <UNK> in what may be the first mainstream british film to so portray it it is may and not darren daniel craig who <UNK> the encounter and at least to begin with it seems that the relationship is <UNK> on mutual respect there is no explicit sexual content at least in the dvd i saw differences in the imdb cast list suggests the existence of other versions and the physical basis of the affair is handled directly but not <UNK> more strongly portrayed is the relationship between may and daughter paula a recent <UNK> to <UNK> and self <UNK> who <UNK> that mummy has never been supportive of her paula is also <UNK> lover and when she finds <UNK> explicit but rather poor drawings of darren and may together things go downhill in dramatic but controlled fashion only in an english film perhaps could a daughter <UNK> that she is going to hit her mother <UNK> ask her to stand up and <UNK> <UNK> her br br in the mean time may is being drawn into a <UNK> relationship with a decent but older of her own generation member of <UNK> writing group the contrast between the ensuing <UNK> <UNK> and her affair with darren is clearly made it is at that point that may starts to <UNK> to paula and <UNK> worm begins to turn he reveals on cocaine that he may have been after her money if not all along but for some of the ride so may finds herself superfluous to both of her children's needs and finally does return home but later leaves on a jet plane for <UNK> new br br the film's strength is that it portrays with <UNK> but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent sibling relationships where <UNK> may leave the surviving parent feeling more alone than if they had no one to care for them this is not new but the <UNK> of the portrayal of sexual need in the over 60s may well be the darkness of the film's content from a screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> stands in contrast to the way in which it is lit it seems to be <UNK> summer and the overall mood is uplifting it could so easily have been yet another piece set in a <UNK> and rainy england the ending is perhaps under written as we don't know where may is going or for how long perhaps she's shirley valentine with a <UNK> she's certainly no <UNK> anne reid is however revealed as a fine actor whose professional life will surely have changed forever like julie andrews in torn curtain said by paul newman there goes your mary <UNK> read <UNK> image for good br br yes he announced <UNK> 2005 as the new james bond
<START> so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film looking at the card i turned to my wife and said how many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb only about 5 for me but then watching the interaction between peter falk and paul reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the film's setting of new york state i slowly starting <UNK> the movie up a category at a time certainly it was good but the totally natural <UNK> of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a <UNK> wearing detective rather than this film the movie jumped to the excellent level br br by the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and <UNK> heart <UNK> just like the <UNK> and i ended up giving this a superb br br this picture is a must for anyone who has parents no violence or nudity but some strong language
<START> <UNK> episode justice is the best episode of <UNK> it's my favorite episode of <UNK>
<START> first off i'm a dedicated fan of <UNK> and have been reading the comics since i was a child and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one rocks br br well then here we go ms blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives if the <UNK> wins one round she'll have to tell him about herself if she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free sounds stupid yeah well i'm not that good at explaining either br br she tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the <UNK> camp and how they escape living by <UNK> own rules they hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for <UNK> they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herself br br then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for and there the story ends br br what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the <UNK> are totally cool alexandra <UNK> is a terrific modesty blaise just as modest and strong <UNK> and intellectual as the comic one br br feels awkward though too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but that's not relevant since the comic book blaise can't speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking english in the <UNK> br br the acting is really good even the child who <UNK> the young blaise must have a applaud br br my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid <UNK> ass totally awesome d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s br br watch it you won't be disappointed
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the best film i saw in the year 2000 bravo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shot and stunningly portrayed <UNK> <UNK> is a bold film that <UNK> <UNK> romance which is such a taboo in hollywood women of all <UNK> <UNK> and color <UNK> the film cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and <UNK> within their ranks
<START> i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good and that it has some slow parts but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun first of all the performances are great michael douglas kim basinger <UNK> sutherland and eva longoria michael douglas proves he has still got it and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife <UNK> sutherland and eva longoria play the dynamic duo both adding their incredible talent to the pot and second of all this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore its plain and simple if you want to go to the movies and have a lot of fun see the sentinel
<START> once again the same familiar story about a man writer here who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life success unfunny script we should go home and write better ridiculous lines in order to understand the strong <UNK> message our only <UNK> in life is to find love respect and a good friendship and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil jennifer love <UNK> is no sexy or evil at all for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character not bad efforts from the actors baldwin also as a director <UNK> in a sex and the city role again <UNK> with some funny lines in his limited role p s try also a not so popular film from <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a brilliant adaptation of this myth an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth
<START> unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 <UNK> at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie my points br br film is based on 2 things br br 1 <UNK> point of view as it happens on most of the american films the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture but unfortunately it is not enough knowing <UNK> and 2 names of other <UNK> doesn't make a person understand a culture for example <UNK> is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that <UNK> people are christian ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other <UNK> countries the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make <UNK> so we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film br br 2 sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong br br i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre please watch dr <UNK> and understand the meaning of black humor a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it where is the truth where is the meaning about the movie
<START> having first watched the movie at 14 i remember being struck by hearing the word <UNK> sh t for the first time ever on the then still soviet tv i bet it really was the first time in history  anyone wants to add this to trivia section what an open <UNK> and freedom i thought as years passed i was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept <UNK> opposite to my 14 y o impression <UNK> there's an air of inevitable catastrophe <UNK> throughout the movie of primitive <UNK> tide <UNK> by <UNK> sweeping the lives of the finest minds <UNK> humanity in their areas it's a great metaphor of russian revolution in general inspired by <UNK> ashamed of their <UNK> and hoping to <UNK> the lower classes only to <UNK> the power of mediocrity and get <UNK> by it an extremely fine and talented piece <UNK> a truly sad idea in a brilliantly <UNK> and elegant form <UNK> enough the movie itself marked the end of the soviet movie traditions era before the hollywood <UNK> had knocked them over  for good it seems judging by most current russian movies most of them labeled <UNK> in <UNK> trailers and posters br br <UNK> that <UNK> episode is in no <UNK> to <UNK> comment above re rude language of current generation from what i've already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this but it was not a mild word by current standards it was way too rude back then and just rude enough to show the true nature of all <UNK> btw re <UNK> <UNK> it is <UNK> naive to <UNK> being intellectual and using rude <UNK> especially for russian <UNK> where a single <UNK> could have meanings that take sentences in translation but i join in regret that all the meaning in today's <UNK> talk may be expressed by <UNK> i feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that's most efficient for the task well this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it
<START> a <UNK> couple brooke adams jeff <UNK> go to a doctor james karen to try to <UNK> it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby br br pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script the basic idea is ok but becomes <UNK> predictable towards the end i saw every twist coming the direction is poor he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene the production values are to be nice lousy very <UNK> and the gore scenes are too unpleasant i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach with lousy special effects the film completely <UNK> at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film br br some good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams <UNK> and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown it's easy to see why i give it a 4
<START> this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever <UNK> great acting and a fair dose of magic br br i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot based on the neil <UNK> novel which i am now looking to read and colorful characters br br one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is unlike so many sci fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open endings and such this was a pure fairy tale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel br br original fun feel good fantasy
<START> i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don't just <UNK> feed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesn't compare to other mind <UNK> like the usual suspects or <UNK> but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film br br another thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it you'll know what i mean br br so to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no one ever said revolver is for everyone and that's my 2 cents
<START> very different topic treated in this film a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs by looking at the daily operation of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when older son returns home wrongly believing his father has died how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat play games discuss personal matters and get honest advice besides the usual <UNK> like <UNK> when old man dies strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge so public bath operation is not <UNK> and finally the arrival of <UNK> to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along the public bath has to be <UNK> making place for a commercial complex to be constructed

<START> i saw this movie with my family and it was great this film is more than just a documentary that offers not more than cold facts with long <UNK> <UNK> and lots of <UNK> the complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the <UNK> with watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that we are <UNK> in the <UNK> flow of life this movie is not only for <UNK> fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us
<START> the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest strangest darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time so much so it <UNK> the way for more comedies of its <UNK> many of which have copied the style but have never succeeded br br unlike every other sketch show around the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected firstly they all live in the fictional town of <UNK> <UNK> in the back of beyond of northern england br br the first characters to <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> and <UNK> the pig faced owners of a supposedly local shop <UNK> so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence other <UNK> include the <UNK> family with an obsession with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat pauline a <UNK> officer with a sharp tongue and even <UNK> <UNK> mr <UNK> kind hearted vet and menace to all things four <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> salesman with a vicious sense of humour often involving guns electric <UNK> and <UNK> br br despite being a comedy at heart the league of gentlemen often <UNK> genres whilst never appearing to be <UNK> or ripping off other people's material there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a <UNK> a pair of silent twins an obsessive circus owner and a sudden <UNK> of <UNK> even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more <UNK> tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and <UNK> are shown in a more sympathetic vulnerable light the film adaptation is the best <UNK> of this but some fans may decide they belong local br br the equally underrated third series also takes a different route instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be and how <UNK> to explore new areas br br in short the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look as like the welcome signs says you'll never leave
<START> i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no <UNK> from the gray <UNK> reality of this woman's life it is one paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they don't and i don't think i was the only one as <UNK> by the many <UNK> <UNK> around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social <UNK> is no crime but boring your audience to <UNK> is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film
<START> a dreary hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting lower <UNK> valley acting is as amateurish as any i've seen looks like a <UNK> 101 script however it does function as a great <UNK>
<START> the past creeps up on a <UNK> addict when he <UNK> with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last <UNK> in <UNK> life's dramas presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable not even the writing has any bite or wit the cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling <UNK> at one another and the music and photography are <UNK> a couple of the visual effects are laughable indie cliché touches that <UNK> of a <UNK> budget although written and directed by a man this was produced by a woman and i'm not sure but i think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men estranged brothers growing closer never quite <UNK> never feels natural or seems lived in it's an attempt to get inside a male relationship but the careful <UNK> presentation is a cheat no one's heart is in this living breathing or bleeding this material the perfect son is quickly <UNK> by too many <UNK> in the kitchen
<START> prior to this release neil <UNK> had this to say about the 1973 original it's surprising how many people say it's their favorite soundtrack i'm like come on you may not like the new one but if that's your favorite soundtrack i don't know if i want you to like my film br br neil a word you might want to sit down for this too as lord <UNK> says shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent see neil the thing about the original is that paul <UNK> soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical along with richard and danny thompson and bert <UNK> it practically kick started the 1970s folk new wave to <UNK> it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams or the buddy holly story without buddy holly the <UNK> one of the most <UNK> arrogant pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly <UNK> get carter br br the original had apparently left nicolas cage disturbed for about two weeks so disturbed during that <UNK> window that he pitched the idea of re imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter faith struggle ever <UNK> to a writer director previously known for his wholly <UNK> depictions of male <UNK> it's like some <UNK> game what would you get if sam <UNK> took on <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> remade love actually actually i'd quite like to see that unfortunately someone took this <UNK> game seriously all <UNK> succeeded in doing is ripping out the <UNK> guts while <UNK> it with his own <UNK> sex war <UNK> br br after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a

the <UNK> witch trials here the <UNK> observe the <UNK> ways and the few males are near mute breed <UNK> it's like <UNK> fair on a grand scale <UNK> main <UNK> is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for edward as he's <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> cries edward they seem to be everywhere on this island well that's probably because <UNK> main <UNK> is honey br br while making his <UNK> edward <UNK>

man's <UNK> jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia <UNK> can be laid to rest he <UNK> that's about it for the good news this is a story whose chapters were carefully written <UNK> <UNK> with sublime irony though <UNK> the basic cat and mouse premise and credits <UNK> what's left subjects the original to a <UNK> earth policy br br crucial to <UNK> original screenplay was that his christian <UNK> in <UNK> with ritual came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly was a virgin the perfect sacrifice in <UNK> matters to a sexual as opposed to a religious power struggle <UNK> presents the <UNK> of <UNK> for a <UNK> sacrifice by the time cage has worked out he was the bait you honestly couldn't care less br br and cage is one of the very worst things in this a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  an <UNK> whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth <UNK> he <UNK> after he <UNK> a drowned <UNK> with all the mental torment of a man who's set his morning alarm clock half an hour too early one hopes it's his character's frequent <UNK> on <UNK> that has reduced him to this state  alternately <UNK> then full of <UNK> overbearing <UNK> if so it's a fine portrayal of an <UNK> iq <UNK> with anti <UNK> if <UNK> doesn't bear thinking about as <UNK> the <UNK> eyed <UNK> is similarly dreadful presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for <UNK> <UNK> while <UNK> entirely lacks the <UNK> menace to convince who's afraid of <UNK> wolf br br every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs the ingenious score the dialogue lord <UNK> <UNK> you did it beautifully has been replaced with the rather less attractive you did it excellently <UNK> dude  have been <UNK> for a meandering battle of the <UNK> thriller with occasional crash bang <UNK> namely <UNK> women this is a <UNK> flick after all <UNK> sister <UNK> bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes <UNK> little men will be <UNK> with glee at how them <UNK> hippie chicks finally got what was <UNK> to 'em <UNK> <UNK> br br the closing <UNK> sees the whole rotten mess <UNK> under the weight of genre cliché in a bar two guys run into a couple of <UNK> <UNK> on shore leave <UNK> fishing for fresh <UNK> at the moment of their successful pick up you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated <UNK> and a thumbs up to the camera br br one more thing keen credit <UNK> may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count anything up to 10 tend to be not much cop the wicker man has 18 producers in total
<START> warning small plot details revealed br br i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film it is written so badly that every character is a caricature yet it seems to take itself seriously it is poorly cast especially ralph <UNK> all baby faced 5 foot nothing of him as a <UNK> tough plot elements are all drawn in black and white with every situation almost immediately <UNK> to some extreme climax br br most <UNK> of all plot element about to be revealed it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi serious film one can just imagine the filmmakers saying we need <UNK> to shed her top hmmm i've got it early in the film let's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about <UNK> yourself in the <UNK> then <UNK> can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the <UNK> yeah that's the ticket br br i will give the producers credit for <UNK> a <UNK> subject in 1984 one that proved all too <UNK> in the late 90's with events like <UNK> however the execution is dreadful this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of <UNK> a campy political statement like network or a serious examination like <UNK> instead it tries to be all of these things and ends up being none of these things teachers get an f
<START> this is movie is very touching i don't care what people say about this movie this is a very good movie the performances by amitabh <UNK> role has the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay <UNK> was great in his role as the spoiled <UNK> <UNK> the supporting role of <UNK> <UNK> who played the role of <UNK> <UNK> was magnificent <UNK> <UNK> was good in her small role she had in the movie <UNK> <UNK> as the brain dead servant and <UNK> <UNK> as the show off father in law have a very good connection and the comedy <UNK> were hilarious the direction is very good
<START> this movie was so bad that my i q went down about 40 points after seeing it it made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it it must of been some kind of personal favor to van damme
<START> this noir may not be the best remembered film from the era but it features a great mystery plot the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members robert <UNK> the talented director behind the mystery horror classic 'the spiral <UNK> directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both <UNK> and <UNK> the viewer phantom lady focuses on scott henderson a man married to a woman he doesn't like he picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night and the two agree to a <UNK> strings <UNK> night of fun however he then returns home to find his apartment <UNK> by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been <UNK> with one of his neck ties he's <UNK> to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife however luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case br br the plot moves along nicely throughout and unlike many of the better known <UNK> this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting in fact if it wasn't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white i would swear phantom lady was an italian giallo the central characters are all interesting enough with alan curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim and ella raines being effective as the female <UNK> detective the real standout of the film however is <UNK> tone who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece the film also features a role for supporting actor <UNK> elisha cook jr who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment if i was to <UNK> this film i would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early although phantom lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line and overall phantom lady is surely one of the greatest and most under seen <UNK> ever made
<START> it's about an <UNK> peter ustinov who <UNK> a british company <UNK> <UNK> or something like that posing as a computer <UNK> and security expert he secretly learns to hack into the computer while gathering the admiration of his boss karl malden the <UNK> of his office rival bob <UNK> and the love of his inept secretary maggie smith br br some of the business details were a little murky to these non business oriented eyes but they're believable enough and i got the general idea ustinov the <UNK> peter <UNK> phony <UNK> in paris rome and <UNK> and uses <UNK> <UNK> computer to send all kinds of money to these <UNK> <UNK> the overseas companies of course consist of nothing more than himself ustinov and the <UNK> are an abandoned <UNK> <UNK> in paris a <UNK> shop in rome and a <UNK> in germany he simply visits them to collect the <UNK> he's sent himself br br i didn't think i'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side i was expecting something with a faster <UNK> and more outrage along the lines of the pink <UNK> or the <UNK> hill gang but this film <UNK> itself into your good <UNK> as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot the characterizations and the dialog br br probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable br br ustinov to secretary smith let me have the <UNK> of these companies smith <UNK> what are they ustinov little female <UNK> now nothing is made of this little exchange there's a quick cut and no <UNK> for any laughter which is appropriate because one's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh br br ustinov <UNK> out that crummy <UNK> in paris it's covered with <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> around and a couple of the former <UNK> paintings have been left behind the <UNK> doesn't speak english and ustinov knows no french ustinov points to a child like painting of a nude woman and chuckles ah a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eh <UNK> chuckles too replies <UNK> le <UNK> pour <UNK> <UNK> ustinov oh annie so that's her name <UNK> <UNK> ustinov <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if i got those <UNK> wrong je <UNK> bob <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> has the <UNK> for maggie smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he's taking the <UNK> route there is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs caution lay by give way <UNK> ending with the <UNK> stop children there's another montage when <UNK> scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors <UNK> <UNK> police cars a farewell embrace from maggie ending with a sign prison <UNK> <UNK> br br well maybe one more i still can't get over malden as the boss <UNK> <UNK> i never <UNK> over decisions then <UNK> a handful of <UNK> and <UNK> them down with a glass of water br br the acting is <UNK> fine it's bob <UNK> best role for instance not that he had that many and not that his range wasn't limited but he's perfect in this part the musical score by laurie johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it she seems to have written a brief <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> passion is music and his overseas <UNK> are headed by false names like claude <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> phony president is somebody named <UNK> and he's an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> smith is pretty sexy <UNK> and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems br br delightful in its own quiet way but don't expect comic fireworks
<START> unlike another user who said this movie sucked and that olivia <UNK> was terrible i disagree br br this movie was amazing olivia <UNK> is awesome in everything she's in yeah she may be older now because many remember her from romeo and juliet but she's wonderful br br this story line may be used quite often but it's a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who <UNK> i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia <UNK> movie <UNK> my girl and i love her work br br i saw this for the first time on saturday 4 14 <UNK> and fell in love with it not only <UNK> it's an olivia movie but because of it's unique story line and wonderful direction
<START> <UNK> horror is a great title for this film it's absolutely spot on and therefore the only aspect of the film for which i can give 10 out of 10 there are <UNK> there is horror there's even horror that takes place on <UNK> but if there were ever a <UNK> for the film poster it would surely be <UNK> <UNK> this way comes ' for <UNK> horror is easily the worst australian horror film i've ever seen not to mention one of the worst horror films i've ever seen and a fairly atrocious attempt at film making in general the good news is it's so bloody awful it <UNK> straight through the zone of viewer contempt into the wonderful world of unintentional hilarity it's worth watching because it's bloody awful br br the category of <UNK> comes not from the storyline for the simple reason that there actually is one a record producer a film crew and a rock band drive up to the <UNK> named lake <UNK> a <UNK> rural <UNK> somewhere in victoria in reality lake <UNK> to shoot a music video someone isn't especially happy to see them there and possibly in an attempt to do the audience a favour starts picking them off one by one with a very sharp knife even more <UNK> is how long it takes the survivors to actually notice this br br on the surface it looks like a very <UNK> standard b movie slasher you've got highly annoying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> creepy locals one of whom a <UNK> station attendant would easily win a <UNK> competition and let's face it my description of the murderer could easily be jason <UNK> ah but if only the acting and production values were anywhere near as good as the <UNK> masterpiece that was friday the 13th part <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> horror is completely devoid of both these things br br but in the end this only makes what you do get so ridiculous and amusing fans of one time <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> member tony martin will already be aware of some of the real dialogue gems <UNK> out the view you'll bar up ' while the actual song to <UNK> the music video is so bad it has to be heard to be believed i can't help wondering if writer director ollie wood hoped it would actually become a hit the horror element is comparable i think to b slashers of the genre and particularly of the period but there were times when i couldn't help imagining someone biting into a <UNK> off screen and seeing a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the wall on screen br br indeed if you've been listening to tony martin <UNK> this film as hilarious rubbish like myself i don't think you'll be disappointed any fans of <UNK> bad it's <UNK> horror should not pass up the opportunity whether you'll <UNK> <UNK> or not though is another matter if on the other hand you are in search of genuine excellence in the australian horror genre get yourself a copy of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and don't look back
<START> i really thought that this movie was superb not only is the history correct but the style is <UNK> and yet intimate i was a fan of emily <UNK> portrayal of victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual <UNK> while in her youth blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes <UNK> manner that <UNK> became famous perhaps infamous for the romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why <UNK> chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of albert br br the technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well i appreciated the beautiful score which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story i also considered the cinematography to be outstanding some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the <UNK> and <UNK> they depict br br there have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of <UNK> best
<START> we rented five movies for new year's eve weekend and watched this one first all i can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one it was pointless and vulgar harvey <UNK> script must have been easy to write just make two out every three words a curse word <UNK> mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll but the movie has nothing else to recommend it
<START> i've only ever seen this film once before about ten years ago i bought the dvd two days ago and after watching it i think it is even better than i remembered it to be br br paperhouse is much more than just a horror it had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it i especially thought charlotte burke was really excellent here it's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although marc had died she knew he was going to be alright br br several scenes did make me jump which is a <UNK> for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the <UNK> the scene where <UNK> father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and <UNK> to dust br br all in all an excellent and very moving film
<START> the gang of <UNK> every rose has its <UNK> br br a mix of old western and hip hop <UNK> perfectly together the clothing styles the scenery and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted br br plot in five years they robbed twenty seven banks and then <UNK> without a trace now a small western town is under siege and one of the first victims is <UNK> sister the rose gang is ready to ride again and this time it's personal br br rachel michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kim maria <UNK> <UNK> li marie <UNK> and kim <UNK> dash five <UNK> women who split up after five years of riding together when <UNK> sister is killed she ends up <UNK> up her friends once again and riding on a trail of vengeance br br a good <UNK> around version of western if you've seen bad girls well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters br br i gave it 10 10 because the characters plot and scenery made it for me
<START> several features of this film immediately date it the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great <UNK> have been accomplished in sound <UNK> in the ensuing years the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques br br bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me br br <UNK> <UNK> loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie goers as in so many of her character roles bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a <UNK> full of fiery hatred leslie howard is well cast as the <UNK> english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress br br towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> screaming at them this scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film it is probably <UNK> to send you home with a smile on your face and after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending
<START> i really don't get all the <UNK> that this film has received it's <UNK> unnecessarily manipulative and <UNK> many of the big issues ie <UNK> affairs and his <UNK> for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but what's with all the praise for russell <UNK> performance the man just seems to <UNK> about <UNK> his <UNK> and wearing a <UNK> hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that <UNK> performance is little short of caricature it is also rather offensive and dare i say just on the right side of being truly terrible
<START> 1 10 and that's only because i don't go lower with my ratings br br skip this movie and wait for the last movie of the trilogy don't buy or rent it trust me you won't be missing a thing the architect brings no new info spoiler there have been more <UNK> before him he's like <UNK> 6 or something you could already figure something like that out from the first movie agent smith telling us the first matrix created didn't work because it was too perfect <UNK> died and <UNK> love brought her back where have i seen this before oh right in the first movie the roles where <UNK> same as the action scenes nothing new just with more opponents the action scene the 20 ships in the big battle which we didn't see maybe in <UNK> betrayed by someone <UNK> maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab neo who pushed the <UNK> button to soon br br all in all a shameless <UNK> to make money especially off the guys who went to see it more then once which evidently worked like a charm
<START> this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong a simple robbery pick up some serious change get our <UNK> together and everything will be hunky <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> jewelry store no problem insurance pays for it all no guns nobody gets hurt easy money br br older more successful it would appear brother andy philip seymour hoffman has a few minor problems heroin addiction cocaine <UNK> a wife marisa tomei <UNK> he can't seem to perform for his flat belly days long gone younger sweet slightly dim witted younger brother hank ethan hawke with a few <UNK> problems of his own behind in child support <UNK> for his daughter in debt to friends and relatives not exactly <UNK> them in the work of work etc br br sydney lumet in this performance at the age of <UNK> directs and gets it 99 99 percent right which is hard to do in a thriller i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie <UNK> and lives with the plot holes the <UNK> the cheesy scenes and the hurry up ending here lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art every detail is perfect the acting is superb the plot has no holes the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human <UNK> that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the <UNK> himself br br hoffman of course is excellent when you don't have <UNK> leading man presence you have to get by on talent <UNK> and pure concentration ethan hawke who is no stranger to the sweet little guy role adds a <UNK> of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him albert finney plays the father of the <UNK> sons with a kind of <UNK> intensity that <UNK> his age and marisa tomei who has magical qualities of <UNK> to go along with her unique creativity manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as <UNK> two timing wife but who could blame her it's almost a movie <UNK> <UNK> to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars but if you study this film as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do you will notice the kind of excessive according to most hollywood producers attention to detail that makes for real art the sort of thing that only great artists can do and indeed cannot help but do by the way i think there were twenty producers on this <UNK> maybe a dozen check the credits all i can say in <UNK> is way to go sydney lumet author of a slew of excellent films and to show such <UNK> to your craft and your art at such an advanced <UNK> may we all do half so well br br okay the 00 <UNK> percent it was unlikely that the father albert finney could have followed the <UNK> that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail this is minor and i wish all thrillers could have so small a <UNK> also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end we can guess and guess perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out and he just said leave it like that it really doesn't matter and i think it doesn't what happens to hank is not going to be good he isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life he is the kind of guy who gets a light sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of <UNK> human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been br br see this for sidney lumet one of hollywood's best director of the <UNK> 1964 the group 1966 <UNK> 1973 dog day afternoon 1975 network 1976 and many more
<START> philo vance william powell helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show br br usually i hate overly convoluted mysteries like this but i love this movie it moves very quickly only <UNK> minutes is beautifully directed by michael <UNK> he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along has a very ingenious story line including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible and has a very good cast br br powell is very suave and great as vance he doesn't seem to be acting he is vance mary <UNK> isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production everybody else is very good too but best of all is eugene <UNK> as detective heath he's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious br br basically an excellent 1930s hollywood murder mystery well worth seeing br br
<START> there are just so many things wrong with this movie br br to begin with the first twenty minutes of the film could have been <UNK> into just five or maybe ten the overall movie is mercifully short already but this could have been made up for by giving a little more attention to the mean lion how did the miss a reference to the <UNK> on that one and working his subplot a little more closely into the main plot in short the script had the seed of a good idea but needed quite a bit of <UNK> br br second it could have done without the crude humor the original also had some that it could have done without but at least there it was almost an <UNK> here <UNK> and <UNK> abound br br third the show is a little too self aware the original series had that well enough as did the first movie but here it's just way way too much the brendan <UNK> in jokes were just a bit over the top and why no mention of the new ursula other gags with the narrator especially a couple of interactions near the end also <UNK> good sense br br fourth a bit more attention could have been given to the cgi work in the first it was hard to tell that <UNK> wasn't a real elephant except by behavior of course but here the cgi stands out like a sore thumb <UNK> special effects should merely tell the story whether they're good or bad and they at least do succeed on that count so it's a relatively small problem but it's still there br br all that said christopher <UNK> performance as george is decent enough it lacks brendan <UNK> charm but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison he even managed to give george a bit of personal depth which should have been a major foul in a jay ward inspired movie but wasn't here julie <UNK> as the new ursula surprised me as being even better than leslie mann in the original br br most other performances were pretty standard not standing out in my mind as either good or bad
<START> i got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it it had a 7 8 in imdb 9 votes only and some <UNK> comments were pleasant but i have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo yes great cinematography the film is well directed but it never freaked me out it starts well but although it not bored me at all the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal that i didn't like it very much br br you can make a few laughs and you can see some little tits but if you like the kind of <UNK> i like bizarre surreal <UNK> gory atmospheric brutal murders you won't appreciate much this film br br i give it a 4 for the good directing and editing and the final twists that make the film entertaining but it could be much better
<START> this series premiered on the cable tv station comedy central in the united states it was chopped to death and shown out of sequence this was sad for the audience it should have attracted it didn't and fell by the <UNK> luckily at the same time my cable company went digital and i got the bbc thank goodness because i got to see the league of gentlemen in order complete and uncut br br the league of gentlemen <UNK> is right up there with <UNK> monty <UNK> flying circus and <UNK> the kids in the hall but a warning br br the league of gentlemen though are one step beyond it's not only about dressing in drag and <UNK> the cultural <UNK> it goes deeper and much much darker i can tell many of you now it will offend certain groups of people it will <UNK> others but remember its only comedy dark dark comedy if that is not your thing don't watch if you think you know dark comedy watch this if you get angry and upset then you don't quite know dark comedy br br these guys got it right and right on the button they are brilliant they are excellent and i enjoyed each and every character creation there's a complete story that is told here from episode one to the end you cannot watch this one episode at a time willy <UNK> that is one of the charms of this series watch it in order see how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are no one and nothing is out of <UNK> that my <UNK> is dark humor bravo
<START> the only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry drop out i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn i though i had actually rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene jim watch your ass nick you watch yours together i wont leave you behind br br the first action sequence shows how awful the production is but its really kind of funny good guys have <UNK> weapons in one scene they all have fake hk <UNK> sub machine guns next scene <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then to top it all off they do some weapon <UNK> between scenes with a couple of m <UNK> i think they had a budget <UNK> for guns not enough to go around between the good guys and bad guys fight scenes are poorly <UNK> and fake as all hell you have to remove the pin <UNK> from a <UNK> for it to explode on its own you can't fire a shoulder launched missile of any kind while riding inside a helicopter weapons that you throw away don't suddenly re appear when a gun is out of bullets throwing it away is still pretty stupid unless you have no idea how to <UNK> them big slow <UNK> driving around in first gear make for awkward action scenes i really cant believe movies like this are actually produced this movie would be hilarious on <UNK> <UNK> or maybe just drunk
<START> i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed it's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several <UNK> <UNK> along the way to calm my nerves if i had to <UNK> i'd say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene <UNK> with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming br br although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it <UNK> the creepy fear factor it had elements of the shining the <UNK> sense and the <UNK> in particular the soundtrack reminded me of the <UNK> br br i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare
<START> as did others in this forum when <UNK> planet was offered in 1956 i rushed to see it this story is an interesting phenomenon i suggest because young old male female sci fi experts and people who find such fare <UNK> out all can follow and enjoy this film's story and plot lines very well this is the first movie set on a planet other than earth in the 20th century other than serials such as flash gordon leslie <UNK> was <UNK> a bit weak for his role at that time but walter <UNK> marvin miller anne francis richard anderson earl <UNK> and especially warren stevens all <UNK> themselves very well there are so many visual <UNK> in this one it's hard to choose a favorite from the film's scenes the approach to <UNK> 4 the starship itself the landing on the <UNK> alien surface the descent via <UNK> stairs the first view of the landscape the approach of the rocket <UNK> dr <UNK> house seen from without and from within the underground complex and its wonders the setup of the <UNK> the battle with the monster the final approach of the unseen <UNK> the escape from the doomed planet all these scenes are <UNK> into the viewer's mind because we discover them along with the participants veteran <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> script was filmed intelligently by long time director fred <UNK> <UNK> with clarity and imagination it is a shock to realize there's no music at all the film is carried by the words the actors and the mystery revelation storyline it can be watched again and again with pleasure i have been doing so for nearly fifty years until this famous and well loved film was created no film had tried to imagine a world beyond earth and for decades afterward ships kept crashing back on the planet as if the <UNK> <UNK> were failing and causing the crashes still the best many say that says something negative about this <UNK> so called intellectual <UNK> <UNK> and something very positive indeed i suggest about those who made this gem
<START> br br this movie is by far one of my favorites i saw it while in college in the early 90's and while i couldn't identify with the <UNK> in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top notch to the people who spoke <UNK> of indian summer feel free to stick to your overblown <UNK> type movies and leave the movies with a great wholesome story to those who can appreciate them
<START> spoilers br br i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt br br the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman <UNK> through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things br br first of all the film was so down to earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis it became itself ordinary and dull br br secondly the overall <UNK> of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable br br too bad
<START> roy rogers and company try to bring <UNK> back to life it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful andy <UNK> as cookie <UNK> around jane <UNK> as carol loses a piece of her <UNK> to mr <UNK> sharp <UNK> <UNK> willing and the riders of the purple <UNK> stand in or is that sing in for the a w o l bob nolan and the sons of the <UNK> james <UNK> from the laurel and hardy films adds to the slapstick look of grand canyon trail a loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance mr <UNK> <UNK> kicks its heels there are energetic human performances too but the material isn't grand br br grand canyon trail 1948 william <UNK> roy rogers jane <UNK> andy <UNK>
<START> i was mad anyone made this movie i was even more angry i lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this i could have had a wax job and been more entertained at least <UNK> makes me laugh before it hurts i was a bit confused at first but then i caught on and realized what was going on by this time the film was half way through and yes i am a <UNK> but i always want to see things through until the end so i stuck it out i watched it all not only are the actors not as attractive as in cruel intentions they just aren't convincing i've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie if you like bad movies with bad acting watch this
<START> i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won't get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent
<START> i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john <UNK> vampires los <UNK> is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film <UNK> <UNK> anyone br br a tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon <UNK> as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time it's not even <UNK> bad br br what we end up with is a dull <UNK> film with a terrible script and <UNK> bad and clichéd acting it just <UNK> of low budget br br avoid like the <UNK> plague
<START> off the <UNK> let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i don't make statements like the above lightly secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before <UNK> over to bruno rats night of terror mattei this is no dawn of the dead folks br br that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen br br the script is wonderfully horrible just check out the two scientists trying to find an <UNK> let's try putting these two <UNK> together br br the zombies come in all <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> wielding <UNK> to birds br br the gore is <UNK> legs are bitten off arms <UNK> <UNK> burst open br br the pace is fast flying from one zombie attack to the next br br then there's the head in the <UNK> oh the head in the <UNK> one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2 br br you should know already whether you're the sort of person who's going to like this sort of film get some mates and some beer and you'll be in for a fun night br br did i mention the head in the <UNK>
<START> for all the subtle charms this student film may contain was anyone else bored to death waiting <UNK> to show his paper macho face br br the anti climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed <UNK> to develop br br don't get me wrong i'm all into exploring america's dark <UNK> but this is a turd a <UNK> that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p <UNK> looks hot taking it br br sadly from a guy from wings br br the best 2 minutes the film has to offer br br if you felt like ripping off deliverance you could do better
<START> upon the first viewing i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tales after many more i think it's one of the best some of the songs are pretty bad especially the love song but two things stand out that make the movie even the singing worthwhile one is the art direction like the other cannon movie tales this is a beautifully <UNK> period piece every piece of cloth and jewel both of which have major parts in this movie's plot look fresh and new and contrast with the plain clothes of the <UNK> even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess wonderfully done the other thing is the comic timing a lot of the movie is cheesy but the <UNK> vanity and his making fun of himself in the end the suspicious guard the guard chasing nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose and the sequence during the song <UNK> o makes up for the songs that weren't so good
<START> i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed it made much of the fact that the film was by the director of cube and made it look like a horror film when in fact it is an <UNK> comedy <UNK> spell <UNK> doesn't seem to think that <UNK> is a word but it is reminiscent of <UNK> and <UNK> are dead br br i love the way the story builds up slowly at first then gradually <UNK> i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube i recommend it
<START> not one of keaton's best efforts this was perhaps a <UNK> attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into the <UNK> a polish english language <UNK> and a series of <UNK> leads buster into a marriage with a large irish woman who along with her father and brothers treat him <UNK> until they think he may be an heir to a fortune mistaken identities abound here gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off br br this <UNK> short does have at least two real laughs <UNK> cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the <UNK> on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate the other is a family photo with the entire group slowly <UNK> to the floor as the <UNK> of the camera loses its <UNK> br br the <UNK> beer <UNK> could have been the <UNK> for a massive series of gags built upon gags but stops short for all the <UNK> of development br br <UNK> print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano drums and sound effects not one of <UNK> best efforts but worth a few laughs
<START> a bit of a disappointing film i'd say the acting was stilted somehow in many cases i just couldn't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene an angry or sad happy frustrated character should make the viewer believe that he's angry or sad happy frustrated that doesn't happen here br br the comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt they do things and say things which come out of nowhere the character andrew <UNK> his parents of sending <UNK> to each other at dinner then he blows up and <UNK> out telling his father don't touch me you f maybe if we'd seen the prequel we would understand where all that comes from but there is no prequel so we're somewhat at sea as to the reason br br one odd quirky thing that andrew does is to go to an old stone <UNK> sit down on the edge <UNK> the still water below then he reaches into his <UNK> pocket and <UNK> a pack of <UNK> and lights one up he did this same thing three times during the film i guess we're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry maybe once but three times it might even have been four times i lost count br br to be honest there is the fact that he's recently found out that he's adopted this happens very early in the film so there's no sense of any dramatic change he might be <UNK> because of this discovery it's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else br br i guess there is a sort of <UNK> feel to the film but should a first time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career
<START> my all time favorite movie oscar caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george <UNK> in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike <UNK> and cinematographer rex <UNK> it is <UNK> <UNK> best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan <UNK> having watched this movie at least 50 times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney <UNK> is a marvel
<START> my 3 year old loved it i loved it my wife loved it so 10 out of 10 from our family as for violence level not really that violent mostly of the slap stick variety nobody truly dies no gore no blood no torture so it certainly is appropriate for children much more so than many saturday morning cartoons br br this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go br br first of all beautiful graphics <UNK> wonderfully done with true depth not trying to be realistic but <UNK> an artistic whole the moss on the stones the <UNK> on metal the <UNK> on the wood and the stone everything adds to the whole br br character <UNK> unlike many contemporary cg movies is quirky not cute again within an artistic whole the faces may look less <UNK> than in some other movies but the characters are more puppet like than human like i think that is a good thing it lends <UNK> how strangely it may sound it is easier to suspend your disbelief br br hair fur clothing on par at least with the likes of pixar just note in the opening scenes when <UNK> <UNK> is fighting the giant slug <UNK> is in front of some <UNK> and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it br br the setting far beyond the likes of cars and even <UNK> space has been done many times but the fantasy <UNK> of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings but again it is an artistic whole and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly magnificent <UNK> like the scene in monsters inc where they ride all the <UNK> through its <UNK> facility or <UNK> where we see the immense trash towers he made abound in this movie everything is grand yet never <UNK> upon it is just the background the whole way the <UNK> where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls the chinese wall the islands floating in the sky the <UNK> in the sky that is truly where i believe cg should go make something which takes your breath away and do it again and again br br the sound is good the music is varied and not only epic and thankfully without any <UNK> and purely original for the movie br br animation is quite good <UNK> its inspiration to cartoons especially some good use of stretch and squeeze sometimes not that realistic but the 3d models are not realistic either br br characterization is well done too <UNK> <UNK> the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence <UNK> in the attention of little <UNK> br br <UNK> the <UNK> manager of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself in the end while <UNK> isn't really changed at all but who wants that cute child to change anyway i at least loved <UNK> <UNK> more than any other recent character since <UNK> in monsters inc br br the internal <UNK> in the group gets <UNK> out by the <UNK> <UNK> just as it should in a proper fantasy story br br the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story especially how the world <UNK> apart the monsters are pretty standard fare except the <UNK> one it lacks the emotional impact of <UNK> which is the really strong point of that movie but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying musical scene <UNK> in the former one and has action from the first scene this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time br br the whole movie has as i've mentioned a whole vision which seems to have been followed <UNK> throughout br br it seems that the setting is ready for more adventures and i for one would hope so br br one side note the french actor doing <UNK> <UNK> sounded a bit like jean reno at first but i'm happy it wasn't him though he is one of my favorites nice to hear a new to me voice br br i give it a max rating a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote approach this movie as an adventure and as a european movie not opposed to hollywood but different
<START> atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a <UNK> attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
<START> i just sat through a very enjoyable fast paced 45 mins of roll br br roll is about a country boy <UNK> toby malone who has dreams of becoming a sports star <UNK> travels to the city and is to be picked up by his cousin george <UNK> robertson well that was the plan anyway george is involved with a gangster tiny john <UNK> and is making a delivery for him needless to say <UNK> gets dragged into <UNK> world br br i thought it was great how <UNK> teaches george some morals and respect while george teaches <UNK> how to relax and enjoy life a little toby and <UNK> were well cast together and did an outstanding job br br every character in the movie <UNK> each other very well the two cops were great david <UNK> brought some great comic relief to the movie tiny played a likable gangster that reminded me of one of my favourite characters <UNK> from two hands br br one of the other things that i liked about roll was that it <UNK> the cities that i grew up and lived in for 20 years <UNK> and <UNK> it was good to see sights and <UNK> that i grew up with especially the old <UNK> wheel br br this rocks <UNK> rolls
<START> ask yourself where she got the gun remember what she was taught about the <UNK> mindset when the con is over the gun had <UNK> and it was provided to her from the very beginning br br when the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red <UNK> and lead her to the gang splitting up her 80 thousand br br the patient was in on the con from the beginning br br <UNK> does not die in the end the gun had <UNK> br br there enough spoilers for you there this is why people are giving it such high ratings it's extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience
<START> i have seen this movie this movie is the best according today's need <UNK> in <UNK> is the major problem nowadays in stating this problem this movie is the best in this movie the indian values are stated very well today's youth must understand this problem there is less population of girls and due to this problem of <UNK> the girls committed suicide if this problem continues then the day when there is no girl child is not far away so keep in mind this statement today's youth must understand that we can not take <UNK> in <UNK> we have to learn from this movie that the <UNK> should not be taken and if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society this is the major change in the society
<START> massive multiple chills down the spine i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it i saw it at 10 <UNK> in the morning and still got scared stiff and i've seen hundreds of thrillers horror movies for crying out loud i'm 22 i mean ok voice acting not particularly good probably even b movie ish but the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow from the very start hitting you again and again with relentless <UNK> <UNK> scenes so many clichés yet none fails to surprise scare you know it's coming it's coming it's coming boo and you still jump off the chair grab a <UNK> and a <UNK> call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night hats off to the japanese
<START> what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the <UNK> georgia <UNK> considering that this is my main town i am very much a sci fi <UNK> and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a sci fi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of <UNK> nor of eric <UNK> having watched a few episodes his performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen <UNK> i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as <UNK> was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story which i think was even more his goal seeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend
<START> i admit the problem i have with the much celebrated ealing films i've seen so far could be mine to my taste either they are black and <UNK> funny or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories that's a self important way of saying i wanted to like the man in the white suit but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time br br <UNK> worker sidney <UNK> alec guinness may be meek in manner but he is <UNK> committed to progress in the form of his attempts to <UNK> a <UNK> of fabric that can't be broken or made dirty using a factory lab for his latest experiment he <UNK> against limitations both material and human the latter being the <UNK> mill bosses who don't understand what he is up to then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him br br it's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress sidney complains practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man br br one problem with man in the white suit is that <UNK> vision of progress is awfully small minded too more so even than that of the bosses or the <UNK> who also <UNK> his work my problem is more <UNK> for a comedy white suit is not funny it's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit takes double takes triple takes and <UNK> takes br br the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney <UNK> at going <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> endlessly and <UNK> <UNK> looks from every visitor until sidney either <UNK> his miracle from it or blows it up trying like every other bit of stray humor that functions <UNK> in this film it's <UNK> on too long br br i've never seen guinness less affecting in a movie even though he looks <UNK> young and earnest though actually in his mid 30s he seems so <UNK> even more so than the wax faced general he played in doctor <UNK> he's the same cold fish whether he's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life <UNK> when he loses his job pan faced <UNK> hope as <UNK> or the more <UNK> charms of young daphne <UNK> joan <UNK> his one real ally in his fight against <UNK> and dirt as she puts it making those words sound as <UNK> sexy as only <UNK> could br br supporting players make white suit work as well as it does ernest <UNK> of bride of frankenstein fame plays a <UNK> nasty captain of industry who looks like <UNK> and makes a laugh like a death <UNK> howard marion crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a <UNK> medical officer in lawrence of <UNK> then there's the <UNK> charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else br br but most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn't think director alexander <UNK> had ever worked on a comedy before his previous ealing comedy <UNK> <UNK> doesn't reverse that impression alas roger <UNK> play <UNK> the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most <UNK> pleasant of lights br br ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy yet the <UNK> i've seen never seem to do this working only when they play <UNK> against our own <UNK> kind hearts and <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> again go figure are classics this way white suit on the other hand is a pointless <UNK> that falls apart when it should <UNK> just like that unfortunate suit
<START> harold <UNK> <UNK> anthony <UNK> classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go <UNK> the original film starred laurence olivier and michael caine caine has the olivier role in this version and he's paired with jude law here the film is directed by kenneth <UNK> br br the acting is spectacular both caine and law are <UNK> in their respective roles i really like the chemistry and the <UNK> of personalities it's wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the <UNK> direction goes <UNK> br br harold <UNK> dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and i understand why he was chosen to rewrite the play which is updated to make use of <UNK> cameras and the like the problem is that how the script moves the characters around is awful <UNK> caine walks law through his odd modern house with <UNK> doors and <UNK> for no really good reason conversations happen repeatedly in different locations i know <UNK> has done that in his plays but in this case it becomes tedious why do we need to have the pair go over and over and over the fact that law is sleeping with <UNK> wife it would be okay if at some point law said enough we've done this but he doesn't he acts as if each time is the first time the script also doesn't move caine through his manipulation of law all that well to begin with he's <UNK> angry to start so he has no chance to turn around and scare us never mind a late in the game revelation that makes you wonder why he bothered in the original we never suspected what was up here we do and while it gives an edge it also somehow feels false since its so clear we are forced to wonder why <UNK> milo doesn't see he's being set up there are a few other instances but to say more would give away too much br br thinking about the film in retrospect i think its a film of missed opportunities and <UNK> the opportunities <UNK> are the chance to have better fireworks between caine and law <UNK> in that the choice of a <UNK> setting and odd shifts in plot take away from the creation of a tension and a believable thriller instead we get some smart dialog and great performances in a film that doesn't let them be real br br despite some great performances and witty dialog this is only a 4 out of 10 because the rest of the script just doesn't work
<START> before lost everything shown on tv was predictable you could predict who was gonna die or who will find something but in lost you could predict nothing every thing was so surprisingly stunning and it really was a mystery not because it has so many secrets but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great i literally became addicted to it lost is a classic work of art it gives you something to look forward to every week it is genius the surrounding is brilliant it is calm and warm at the beach and so scary in the jungle the characters are a work of genius every one of them especially the ones already on the island the <UNK> are so dramatic yet we can never predict their deaths because they have so much more to do and so much more to say and they have secrets affecting the other <UNK> that die with them
<START> return of the <UNK> is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the <UNK> is just a clip show br br <UNK> of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this is br br the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie br br i have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it
<START> mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama <UNK> filmed in china in 1948 <UNK> <UNK> stunning performance as the <UNK> in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the <UNK> to see this magnificent film take it
<START> a not bad but also not so great heist film kirk douglas is a recently released from prison safe cracker who after turning down an offer from the mob decides to pull the job himself he <UNK> circus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mayhem ensues douglas and <UNK> soon find themselves pursued by mafia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as well as <UNK> in a really goofy love triangle with <UNK> infinitely patient girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving <UNK> <UNK> though an italian production most of the filming appears to have been done in germany douglas is fine not just <UNK> it in an giallo <UNK> the striking <UNK> gives a terrific performance the music is by <UNK> <UNK> and the cinematography is by the great <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who managed to work with everyone in italy from <UNK> and fellini to <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> don't get me wrong this is a terrible clichéd film but it is a delight for fans of olivia <UNK> quite possibly the most <UNK> beauty ever to grace the silver screen one poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at i wonder what his ideal woman looks like paris <UNK> slut blockbuster should really establish a sub genre to this type of film as the fatal attraction plot has become a genre <UNK> itself when will blockbuster adopt the <UNK> section it will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections right this film revolves around olivia <UNK> who spends a night of passion with an unstable <UNK> owner who may have murdered his ex wife who looks remarkably like ms <UNK> this <UNK> do well proceeds to stalk olivia and thus make her life a living hell i like olivia <UNK> but i have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their <UNK> so i really wasn't rooting for olivia to make it out o this stinker alive br br violence there is a <UNK> of violence in the film don murray and anthony john <UNK> get involved in a <UNK> when <UNK> says that he will not stop seeing olivia <UNK> wife because she is just too good in bed olivia also gets to handle a <UNK> and might get to squeeze off a round i'll let you watch br br nudity olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here she has a love scene with anthony john <UNK> and also has a shower scene shot at a distance br br story we've seen this plot before a hundred times over and <UNK> done much better the true <UNK> when trying to <UNK> why this film was a dud is william <UNK> the man's dialogue is <UNK> and moronic the man has no story telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot these people of the upper <UNK> of society talk like middle school kids with a habit of sleeping during english class i have placed <UNK> on the never to be viewed again list br br acting the acting wasn't <UNK> in as the <UNK> say but was <UNK> a great deal by <UNK> juvenile script olivia <UNK> <UNK> to calling anthony <UNK> <UNK> weird and crazy to his face when he begins to stalk her <UNK> who is still beautiful delivers the best performance here but <UNK> was equal to the task of portraying a demented love crazed stalker don murray was basically just there his character not fleshed out and edward <UNK> a terrific actor when given something with substance is ill used in this film
<START> i can give you four reasons to see this movie br br 1 four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinema br br 2 four good stories related into a big scheme br br 3 a surprisingly good cast br br 4 a bitter <UNK> about the biggest trouble in this country and many others br br possible spoilers br br <UNK> <UNK> opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the <UNK> against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts br br then antonio <UNK> gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian <UNK> with a peter and the wolf like <UNK> br br in the third story the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context carlos <UNK> tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment but after the recent <UNK> at <UNK> and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico this story couldn't be more updated br br and at the end <UNK> <UNK> returns to the dark humor in the grand finale in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed <UNK> the center scene from one of his previous films <UNK> el <UNK> <UNK> gives the final lesson of the theme and by the way give us the scene that steals the movie with anna <UNK> making a brief <UNK> br br once the movie has ended you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie and maybe enjoyed it with a very painful subject they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example this film is a <UNK> of how <UNK> have learn to live in the middle of a crime state and perhaps accepted it between two fires the criminals and the so called authorities full of corruption even this movie is a <UNK> thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don't get this <UNK> if you had an assault without a scratch then you're lucky meanwhile don't lose the chance to see this movie highly recommended br br and it's a beautiful life in mexico
<START> fear of a black hat is a superbly crafted film i was laughing almost continuously from start to finish if you have the means i highly recommend viewing this movie it is by far the funniest movie i have had the pleasure to experience grab your stuff
<START> this is what i call a great movie it lives <UNK> the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live is the bus driver and his son are collecting people <UNK> the country <UNK> on their way to the capital <UNK> the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together br br watch it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with <UNK> humor and lifestyle br br and another reason for its magic it is hard to get
<START> i thought this movie was stunning with completely outstanding performances by <UNK> <UNK> artemisia <UNK> br br <UNK> portrays artemisia so beautifully with <UNK> yet <UNK> mannerisms her hands <UNK> out an idea before moving her models into place the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch br br although not each character was overtly beautiful this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time br br overall i thought this film was fantastic
<START> i was china in this film i choose the screen name <UNK> <UNK> because i was <UNK> at the time in italy and they couldn't <UNK> my real name correctly so i choose <UNK> and then added <UNK> since it was similar to <UNK> br br i had never acted before and it shows but it was so much fun to film they gave me acting lessons each morning which obviously were not useful they dubbed my voice thank goodness br br david and peter were a blast on the set full of good humor and jokes this film was never meant to be taken seriously it was a tax write off according to inside information br br i give it a 1 because i have a sense of humor but a 10 for the fun i had acting in it
<START> i found the pace to be <UNK> and the original story blown way out of <UNK> to the content my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything br br when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and <UNK> tools so quickly it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked <UNK> the servants from getting in br br the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a <UNK> in the eye of the broken <UNK> i have no clue what this was supposed to represent
<START> major spoilers this is for people who have seen the movie br br <UNK> have touched on the major theme of honor in the film and too many comparisons to braveheart i'll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on br br this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion the first character to get pregnant is the <UNK> roth girlfriend and when he <UNK> suggests an abortion she states it is too late for that the shame of her situation i'm to have a <UNK> bastard leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene the second character to find herself pregnant is mary <UNK> wife after a rape by <UNK> character and at least one sex scene with her husband rob late in the movie as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth mary asks what she should do about the <UNK> of questionable origins with a tone <UNK> of abortion rob replies in a noble tone it's not the fault of the child and then states what he thinks the name should be girl or boy i find this pro life stance on the part of the hero to be very un hollywood rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment not <UNK> symbolism br br another related theme is <UNK> character is a bastard someone who evidently does not know who his father was and has few kind words for his mother though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck is it coincidence that roth devoid of family <UNK> is the walking definition of psychopath while rob is the strong husband father figure and of course the hero in the final sword fight between rob and the villain roth the former <UNK> the latter deeply across the chest the left side of the chest over the heart his <UNK> and pseudo father figure john hurt character holds the mother's picture in his hand and <UNK> at it before <UNK> it from the neck of the dead roth br br also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene which was not quite graphic but neither was it off camera and implied i found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal and subsequent post traumatic stress as we call it now my point being that the rape was neither <UNK> nor just implied which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take br br in the final fight scene i have to correct an earlier <UNK> the weapon roth chose was a <UNK> or perhaps a short sword the weapon rob chose was a <UNK> someone was really doing their <UNK> on this entire scene roth would have the upper hand in such a situation but of course the <UNK> is a distinctly scottish weapon what is even more striking to me as a <UNK> and someone who has read a bit on the subject is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made the actors seem actually trying to kill each other not the usual <UNK> to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights including the movies opening fight even more true to history roth is seen several times using the <UNK> as a <UNK> weapon which is it's purpose by design <UNK> were edged but primarily a <UNK> weapon with the edges used mainly for <UNK> an opponents thrust rob uses the <UNK> in broad <UNK> as it's design intent the fight goes down as i would expect it to roth effectively wins though rob wins the day by grabbing <UNK> weapon more symbolism and striking him dead with a powerful <UNK> cut br br folks it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight br br i'll also note that for whatever reason i remember 1995 the year of release distinctly as a time of <UNK> of the u s government hollywood was obviously tuned into that with the release of both rob roy and braveheart and i think the anti government <UNK> are why both films get so much comparison br br i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans tired of the same old not so hidden messages from hollywood
<START> i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was <UNK> the world with his out of this world saga <UNK> the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth <UNK> but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the <UNK> princess leia the <UNK> han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains the sinister darth <UNK> in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no one thought you could do on screen he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time br br when the empire <UNK> back ended with <UNK> of the lovable <UNK> han solo in <UNK> to be delivered to <UNK> the <UNK> and young luke <UNK> from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse <UNK> it seemed had won the day how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from <UNK> daring rescue from <UNK> palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and <UNK> as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to <UNK> the good he believes is still in his father's soul br br old friends like the smooth talking <UNK> <UNK> and the ever lovable <UNK> reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself played by the brilliant ian <UNK> how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means <UNK> his apprentice darth <UNK> all in black with his red eyes ghostly white <UNK> face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the <UNK> master of the events that unfold his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the <UNK> reign for good br br lucas managed to <UNK> three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is <UNK> we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of <UNK> with the help of some adorable ewoks who i really do not believe take from the movie at all in fact i feel they provide a sort <UNK> from the tension of the battles at and in the death star and <UNK> by <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> officers we cheer on <UNK> and the other pilots as they take on the mighty <UNK> fleet and risk life and <UNK> to fly into the <UNK> star to destroy it once and for all and we watch with <UNK> breath as <UNK> and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back br br but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth <UNK> for <UNK> is a battle of emotions and feelings <UNK> is caught between his loyalty to the <UNK> and the empire and his <UNK> <UNK> to luke never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some how one can't but see the confusion and pain on <UNK> face during the final scenes as the <UNK> turns on luke there is more depth and emotion to <UNK> than i believed a villain especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible he is conflicted the apprentice as much as the master the victim as much as the villain without ruining the end too much <UNK> final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy br br so in conclusion what can i say george lucas is the master of the saga star wars is the most compelling and engaging <UNK> i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves it's action suspense romance tragedy redemption joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of
<START> if you came into the film with expectations throw them away now because no amount of hype will do this film justice br br to <UNK> this film into a single genre would be criminal it's a spy thriller has elements of noir bits and pieces of action science fiction and <UNK> all tied together with a brilliant narrative mind <UNK> plot twists and gorgeous cinematography br br a lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative both in good and bad ways of other movies but as they say every story <UNK> from shakespeare so once you can get past that you're in for a hell of a ride br br you will need to suspend your disbelief at some points and while the set never becomes unbelievable there are portions read the elevator which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals don't <UNK> that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy sci fi channel movies though because this is on a much higher level br br if you're looking for action you should turn away this is pure psychology but if you're willing to sit down and <UNK> a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience by all means do it now watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it
<START> i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me she fought alone is about a girl <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> who is raped by <UNK> played by david <UNK> a <UNK> who enjoys hurting girls <UNK> is in a popular high school <UNK> but when she reveals she is raped the <UNK> turns against her led by ethan played by brian austin green br br this movie chronicles <UNK> struggle against an entire town including a high school that essentially lets <UNK> determine the social environment allowing them to get away with whatever they wish br br <UNK> and green are the top performers and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film all of the actors in this film which was inspired by actual events did a great job she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school at least in 1995 and having one's self <UNK> and reputation at stake recommended 10 10
<START> an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a <UNK> both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow <UNK> like atmosphere and the sentimental music i didn't expect but a <UNK> disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy and the interpretation of both actors daniel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the <UNK> family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael <UNK> really nasty in my humble opinion
<START> i thought hugh <UNK> was astounding as the young christy brown and really deserved greater recognition for his role i couldn't believe how well he played the part of course daniel day lewis was brilliant too my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty amazing performances by the two <UNK> and other also
<START> br br everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors that is to say that what might be number one <UNK> for people like bush blair and company may not be so for a great many other people ordinary people from the opening scene in which an iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened with the result the children are not impressed as the death of a <UNK> and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in new york usa wherever that is this series of almost documentary <UNK> pieces <UNK> that not all things are as equal <UNK> all men as some world leaders would try to <UNK> br br whereas obviously the attack on the <UNK> was a <UNK> event by any <UNK> one does get the impression that both politicians and tv <UNK> tend to blow up things out of all <UNK> wonderfully <UNK> in one of these pieces would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on <UNK> say or <UNK> say or even on <UNK> de <UNK> say i rather think not news seems to suffer <UNK> depending on where things happen much more tv time is given to an <UNK> in italy say than one ten times more destructive in outer <UNK> say greater <UNK> seem to <UNK> the <UNK> of the disaster br br this series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective or perhaps i should say some of the pieces do as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story his own translated perspective such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits but <UNK> for each eleven minute segment br br in no way should one <UNK> that this is an anti american film that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages <UNK> through the segments however it is not pro american either the eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link if there is one is that the disaster of the <UNK> attack has to be seen in perspective from different view points only then will such people as george bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on br br clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine i have been <UNK> for two years now america has not <UNK> the lesson and the lesson is that the usa has to share this planet with the rest of humanity not dominate it by ruthless <UNK> <UNK> or just plain force instead of learning that the usa cannot continue just <UNK> all over everybody and everywhere its political leaders aided and <UNK> by blair and even <UNK> have become even more arrogant and even more <UNK> which is not doing any good to anyone in afghanistan or <UNK> at present let alone much elsewhere the white house mentality is totally <UNK> the us and uk <UNK> <UNK> and caused all the chaos and so should clear up the mess they caused not insist on the un and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil br br radical <UNK> adopted by the us or even israel is only going to be met by radical <UNK> from <UNK> people who for years have been <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> if only to cover up their own macho <UNK> i e <UNK> women to death or simply <UNK> them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground br br the world is in a terrible mess <UNK> by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more <UNK> perspectives this film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb <UNK>
<START> <UNK> was worn nearly <UNK> years ago in egypt really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the <UNK> century i also didn't realize the series <UNK> there is a second season airing now isn't there it is amazing to me when <UNK> are made by those who are either ill informed or don't watch a show at all it is a waste of space on the boards and of other's time the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place but that is to be expected from any show the remainder of the first season is excellent i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states
<START> <UNK> this film had so much potential a good cast of quality b actors the <UNK> of jessica simpson and that is about it br br i believe some guy in some <UNK> marketing department had an idea basically lets do a kind of <UNK> blond film but do it in new york that big bright city of chances power and money and where everyone is a heartless power money hungry person let's add to this jessica simpson small town bimbo that brother of owen wilson and for some no apparent reason andy dick only because of him you should ignore this film br br basic story line br br boy leaves girl for ny girl follows boy <UNK> girl stays in ny with cousin gets a job under false <UNK> <UNK> up is <UNK> by other boy brother wilson and together save the day and kiss br br a few words come to mind when <UNK> upon this film i e dire awful unbearable <UNK> and <UNK> br br just don't watch this film you will be happier one reviewer referred to <UNK> and i definitely agree with him this film <UNK> shock and i know what you are thinking at least at some point will i see simpson naked or close too it's not gonna happen spare yourself the time and youtube her you will have better sexy time br br the films editing is flimsy the acting is unbearable and why do they use blue screens br br in conclusion this is cinematic <UNK> which should be <UNK> to the maximum br br another question why does willie nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every jessica simpson flick and why are there no black latin asian or european people in this movie
<START> earth 2009 1 2 big screen adaptation of the bbc discovery channel series planet earth offers quite a <UNK> <UNK> of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw dropping moments of how the hell did they get this footage while taking in the awesome <UNK> of animals in their natural <UNK> and <UNK> message of the circle of life can be cruel witness a great white shark <UNK> down a <UNK> seal as a quick meal and adorable the various babies and their <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> tones of narrator james earl jones <UNK> its <UNK> eye <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> from literally hundreds of hours of footage the only <UNK> comes from the fact this should have been in the <UNK> format and could've even gone longer oh well there's always the next time since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is a tense <UNK> thriller a cut above a b but not really a major production it qualifies as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it <UNK> was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television the director john <UNK> was an up and <UNK> whose best years lay ahead he had just recently begun directing a level films and had already proved himself a most capable <UNK> stars barbara stanwyck barry sullivan and ralph <UNK> were at very different <UNK> of their careers <UNK> glory years were behind her and yet she could still carry a film as she proves here barry sullivan as her husband was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him he was a fine low key actor <UNK> but in an upper middle rather than upper class way which made him excellent in professional roles as the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save <UNK> life he is trapped under a <UNK> and the tide is rising ralph <UNK> is more energetic than usual this excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after brando and <UNK> he was in his way as good an actor as either of them but he lacked charisma his <UNK> with stanwyck which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband by <UNK> only as this is 1953 makes for an intriguing premise which had this been a different kind of film could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about <UNK> character <UNK> is indeed a more exciting character than sullivan and in her scenes with him stanwyck is <UNK> than she is with her husband and son but as this is a formula picture not a <UNK> play the possibility that stanwyck might want want to have a <UNK> leaving aside the question of her husband's <UNK> remains <UNK> in this sense the <UNK> tide doesn't quite have the effect one might have wished though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting fine location photography nearly all of it <UNK> and excellent direction by the woefully underrated mr <UNK>
<START> <UNK> seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the <UNK> of time after it's <UNK> in the early 80s and one repeat it's since sunk without trace this is a crying shame br br i originally watched this when it was <UNK> in the southern tv region on sunday <UNK> and was classic tea time viewing although i don't remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind most notable were the unforgettable titles the <UNK> <UNK> music accompanying the attempted escape across an east european border and the subsequent car crash and that scene has left me with an <UNK> love of <UNK> <UNK> models as they used a <UNK> 200 although it wasn't obvious at the start the solution to the <UNK> mystery was in these titles br br the plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but <UNK> was a surprisingly <UNK> children's drama <UNK> taylor was excellent as billy and it was a shame he didn't do a lot more br br this was a quality drama well <UNK> for a dvd release and i hope i'll get the chance to re <UNK> myself with it in the future br br a fond memory from my childhood
<START> the recent boom of dating show on u s television screens has reached a <UNK> pitch since the first episode of the bachelor unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless <UNK> and variations including the <UNK> joe millionaire for love or money and the <UNK> married by america hoping to cash in on this trend and simultaneously tap and exploit a new <UNK> bravo has unleashed the disastrous boy meets boy upon the world and may they have mercy on us all br br the premise is simple and is designed to be light hearted an <UNK> gay man is <UNK> by a number of <UNK> eliminated show by show until one is left but there's a twist half of the men are actually straight this is not much of a big deal but the inherent <UNK> of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay off if at the end of the show the gay man picks a straight man in disguise the straight man wins a cash prize the gay man gets nothing or at least nothing more than a few <UNK> gifts a pat on the back and a <UNK> round of aren't you embarrassed well thanks for playing br br just the like the equally painful <UNK> eye for the straight guy another bravo program this show is another example of stereotypes run amok what makes it even worse though is the fact that straight men are playing up these stereotypes for cash the producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair <UNK> in a man's hair dress up in <UNK> <UNK> with a pair of designer <UNK> strip him of all body hair and fat and <UNK> it's the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in <UNK> and just as offensive to those of us like myself who are genuinely gay and don't dress act like that it implies that gays have no <UNK> or chance for <UNK> that they can't behave like real people only like stereotypes never mind the fact that the bank of <UNK> is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity all are gym toned most are white and all look far too <UNK> and <UNK> br br this is another example of how instead of <UNK> acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of <UNK> and change hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank i feel genuinely dirty watching this show as show any gay man who sees this <UNK> parade of soft core pornography <UNK> as legitimate television 1 out of 10
<START> the video quality is awful the sound quality is pathetic the acting is horrific the dialog is painful the lighting is dismal the editing is laughable i could go on but it would be pointless <UNK> is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin
<START> the novelty of hearing clean cut jay leno <UNK> four letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic <UNK> police partners caper in <UNK> course the <UNK> faced comedian teams up with the late pat <UNK> to track down a stolen prototype <UNK> think car lover leno played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but leno is no actor and <UNK> fish out of water routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly <UNK> as it fills out its overlong 100 minute running time fans of <UNK> considerable comedic talents will feel let down everyone else will just be bored
<START> i like this movie much it's special type of humor by <UNK> and <UNK> i think it's better then <UNK> <UNK> maybe it's difficult to understand when you are not czech if you are not watching that movie just enjoy it don't mind about anything else just relax
<START> a very refreshing story the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average <UNK> shows humans from a <UNK> point of view especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with not all birds are bird <UNK>
<START> put the camera on me is a <UNK> cute film it is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist on the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids one of the film's directors darren <UNK> had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies sure these are just some cute kids having fun but this is also much more this is a look into some moments in time as children <UNK> with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life fear sexual awakening <UNK> love loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us as we get older we tend to forget how <UNK> the realities of life were when we were little br br what makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young darren <UNK> turn into a little general of a filmmaker it is clear that darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends their problems the <UNK> dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life a lot of children make home movies but i've never heard of or seen children create little movies about the holocaust homosexuality nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends these kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff br br the power of this film is the way <UNK> and shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids all now adults and all still friends this adds a new angle to the film how many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends these guys have and many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later br br among the conflicts a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a <UNK> subject between two of the men some ongoing <UNK> over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years darren <UNK> is a director no doubt about it br br <UNK> and shell take turns <UNK> with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the <UNK> of allowing us to <UNK> into the young lives of these people this is particularly true for <UNK> who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer writer and director from the first moment of put the camera on me we can see the <UNK> of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out we also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always nice or caring and this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience br br there are so many revealing moments but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a nazi we discover thru interviews and narration that the nazi is played by a jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a <UNK> child it is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child br br this is much more than some home movies this documentary captures the pain beauty joy and sadness of growing up powerful stuff and well worth seeing br br
<START> how disney can you get <UNK> rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho analysis this movie sucked br br the girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their <UNK> to get the milk plant yes milk going to employ the workers they keep it <UNK> until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb <UNK> in the <UNK> islands huh not worth my time ever again br br but it is better than <UNK> moving castle d
<START> tom <UNK> turns in yet another oscar worthy performance as dominick <UNK> the brain damaged garbage man who's helping put his brother ray liotta as eugene through medical school br br this is a must see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people br br from the small <UNK> to the <UNK> dancing to the repeated words oh <UNK> whenever <UNK> is in a <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that it's an actor on screen
<START> i can't believe that the city of <UNK> is so hard up for attention that they would embarrass themselves by allowing this show to be done there this show is like a slap in the face to real hard working law <UNK> officers i have never before in my life seen anything so stupid in my life if they had billed it as a comedy that would be one thing but to say it is reality is nothing short of a lie i only saw it once and was appalled at what i saw i wanted to see the little guy get into a foot chase with a bad guy what a joke that would have been nothing on the show was even close to the real world the city of <UNK> the police chief and all the officers should be hanging their heads in shame and should never want o admit they come from that city no wonder it didn't stay around on tv
<START> the cover art which features a man holding a scary <UNK> gun would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film hardly br br i find it interesting that the film's real title is <UNK> warrior <UNK> is a brand of <UNK> in the us this movie is loaded with <UNK> if you like that stuff then this film isn't that bad really however consider these points br br there are numerous close ups of actors' <UNK> <UNK> one scene even features every actor with an <UNK> <UNK> in his pants the film is also <UNK> in <UNK> colors like <UNK> <UNK> and red from a <UNK> standpoint this movie's a drag queen several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another occasionally touching as they <UNK> also the cousin of the hero likes women and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey br br shall i go into the fight scenes yes someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative no fancy stuff here just your standard moves you'd see in an old chuck norris flick there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low speed chase put on film
<START> i was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a mystery science theater experiment but it was just boring it appears that the producers had many biker <UNK> friends and from there casually decided to make a movie br br it is frequently unwatchable lots of footage of the <UNK> riding on a dirt road with the same music played repeatedly unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> is barely in the movie <UNK> probably would have <UNK> things up perhaps she had other <UNK> the day this was filmed br br of course the <UNK> <UNK> a small town fights murder a cowardly cop a goofy mechanic etc one of the <UNK> always wears a football helmet a weak attempt to <UNK> him from all the other <UNK> br br the script has nothing to offer one scene features a biker <UNK> a woman yelling in the <UNK> face you're all the same you're all the same we come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares you're all the same couldn't the writer think of something more creative to say br br at the end the good guys have killed the bad guys we also learn that the wedding between middle aged mechanic joe and young <UNK> has been canceled <UNK> is going away to college and we abruptly learn that <UNK> wedding is still on but with a different bride end
<START> i watched both bourne identity and bourne supremacy on dvd before seeing this in the theater i'd been waiting for this since before they started filming i wasn't disappointed br br minor spoilers below br br overall it was good but it also lacked the continuity of the first two identity and supremacy both <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> rush action to <UNK> drama this movie felt choppy at times the plot building down times were slightly too drawn out that caused the following action to feel too frenetic br br camera speaking of frenetic the trademark <UNK> shaky <UNK> was present and very annoying to me i know its has been talked <UNK> about to <UNK> on the message board but it doesn't mean it's not relevant all the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted the ridiculous camera cuts and <UNK> camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie it is a cheap student director trick to make the film feel <UNK> i'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids but not in this classy adult action series too much extreme close up also do some framing get some interesting shots constant close up feels like lazy directing to me br br story the story was very confusing at first they thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you've missed some crucial information felt rushed or <UNK> for time reasons after you catch up however the story is quite good it's enjoyable following leads along with bourne however i did not care for the whole last scene of supremacy <UNK> bourne on the phone being in the middle of ultimatum thing it basically makes the movie a half prequel i thought that was awkward br br cast characters the star of the movie is the action obviously there are only two originals left bourne and <UNK> parsons them <UNK> up was kind of odd to me i think they just wanted to give bourne someone to protect to and <UNK> in unless i completely missed something they never even tell you why they teamed up the other <UNK> in the movie were pretty quiet this felt like <UNK> <UNK> whoever wanting to not leave open ends understandable but disappointing seriously damon with clive owen in identity and <UNK> <UNK> in supremacy those scenes were phenomenal these <UNK> are as uninteresting as <UNK> the first <UNK> bourne fights in identity the cast in general has <UNK> as the the series went on clive owen was practically an <UNK> that's a measure of strength for that first cast the second they basically trade chris cooper for joan allen not exactly equal this one <UNK> brian cox and <UNK> <UNK> for 3 actors to be named later nothing against david <UNK> scott glenn or albert finney but they're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long the acting was right on br br as a whole it was successful felt like they wanted to get the series over with though if they would have <UNK> or <UNK> the slower parts eliminated scott <UNK> part entirely <UNK> out and taken the camera away from the <UNK> victim it would have been perfect br br ending spoiler br br i don't see why they leave bourne alive at the end it was my understanding this was the conclusion they clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his <UNK> floating <UNK> i thought that was going to be it a full circle type of ending i did like <UNK> <UNK> to the news report though br br spoiler <UNK> warning quote from movie below br br <UNK> last line at the end look at this look at what they make you give <UNK> the first assassin he killed i loved that the final scene was great except that it was <UNK> <UNK> that shot at bourne why would he do that just out for vengeance if he was angry enough to murder why not shoot pamela <UNK> after she <UNK> his top secret file that didn't make sense
<START> this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie worth the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed comedy br br people of all ages will enjoy it my parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some <UNK> br br deserves an a hope it does well at the box office
<START> 'the vampire <UNK> is definitely of interest being one of the early genre setting horror films of the 1930's but taken in isolation everything is a bit too <UNK> for any genuine praise br br the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century where a series of murders are being attributed to <UNK> by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james <UNK> <UNK> and this is <UNK> by the introduction of lionel <UNK> dr <UNK> character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific <UNK> br br the vampire theme is <UNK> and only used as a red <UNK> by having suspicion fall on bat loving village <UNK> herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torch wielding mob to go on the rampage as if they needed one br br this is one of a trio of early horror films in which <UNK> <UNK> and fay <UNK> co starred also <UNK> <UNK> and 'the mystery of the wax <UNK> and like their other <UNK> the film suffers from ill advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though 'the vampire <UNK> is still weak and derivative br br all we are left with is a poor quality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to <UNK> dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank <UNK> was doing the <UNK> films a few years later
<START> horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre lover to watch a film and even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci fi horror gem while <UNK> <UNK> the invisible ray of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff frankenstein bride of frankenstein the mummy or lugosi white zombie island of the lost souls dracula or both the black cat the <UNK> this is <UNK> a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing compared to other universal horror pictures the storyline seems a bit silly but in a delightful manner karloff and lugosi of course shine as always and the film furthermore <UNK> from great <UNK> and an excellent photography karloff plays dr <UNK> rukh a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a <UNK> and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago stunned by <UNK> invention the celebrated french scientist dr felix <UNK> bela lugosi invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor in africa rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great <UNK> and great destruction alike it is somewhat odd that karloff who was in fact british plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi who was hungarian plays a french scientist but they are both excellent as usual as far as i am concerned these two horror <UNK> could have probably been filmed reading the <UNK> <UNK> and i am sure they would have made something out of it either man is an icon of the horror genre and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre by the way this is one of the few films if not the only one in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually <UNK> than karloff frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr <UNK> beautiful young wife the rest of the performances are also good if not particularly worth mentioning other than the casting of karloff and lugosi the film's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi and for his role to have a bit more significance he is fantastic as always but his role could have been bigger and more sinister otherwise the invisible ray is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror sci fi cinema and a must see for all my fellow lugosi karloff fans
<START> i found tremors 4 the legend begins to be dull and boring all the action scenes were stupid the so called <UNK> are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat if not smaller the acting was horrendous and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the <UNK> saga because even though it tells the story of how the <UNK> were formed the story is so dumb and useless also if you want to tell a story way back in time make sure you use the same actor michael gross to be someone in the past when he's someone in the present in the other <UNK> movies <UNK> if you haven't seen this film don't waste your time stick to tremors 1 2 and 3 for a good time this film however make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the stop button working for a quick <UNK> away from this nonsense
<START> here comes the romeo division to change the <UNK> br br let me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have <UNK> god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streets br br i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for it br br again a truly incredible piece of film making
<START> a lot of the user comments i have seen on the imdb for this movie don't really do it justice first of all let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously it's supposed to be a fun yet stupid movie that doesn't require one to think only to enjoy it if you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour then you will be sorely disappointed yet if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors actresses and some good catch phrases then you will enjoy it
<START> three russian <UNK> <UNK> up the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> despite the fact they are down to their last <UNK> in order to support their lavish lifestyle the three use the services of a <UNK> and use the notes at the <UNK> hoping to exchange the bogus <UNK> for a <UNK> andrew hughes a us <UNK> arrives at <UNK> with his wife helen and the three decide to make pals with the <UNK> hoping for financial assistance one of the three russians count <UNK> <UNK> plans to go further with continuous advance towards helen while disappointing the <UNK> maid who loves <UNK> eventually circumstances play their hand against the three <UNK> its obvious that von <UNK> was trying to convey a message with the <UNK> of american women and the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> rather than tell a story and the film really can bore modern audiences like me easily by doing that even the acting which is great in later <UNK> like greed and the wedding march is just run of the mill here the film could have used <UNK> on various levels rating 3
<START> you already know how painful to watch this movie is but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars why the cars should be not only the victim of <UNK> but also the only true actors and performers in it so how on earth you <UNK> <UNK> or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their <UNK> it is painful for those who love cars it is painful for those who love movies br br i want my money back
<START> it's a little <UNK> to have a character named gig young in a movie played by gig young but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name br br i'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as <UNK> she was funny angry vulnerable caring and <UNK> as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the <UNK> and whose father was later killed during <UNK> war i br br as the man of the house <UNK> has stood <UNK> for years against <UNK> her father's will which would therefore allow a donald <UNK> type named charles <UNK> to get the family home but <UNK> keeping a secret as to why she hates <UNK> so much <UNK> fitzgerald is the middle <UNK> sister who is married to an <UNK> but <UNK> her youngest sister's boyfriend gig young br br if you're a stanwyck fan this is a no miss
<START> i watched this a few days ago so details are getting <UNK> the film is shot on hand held cameras and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally since we hadn't had many studio pictures made in this way i can't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen hasn't had all the <UNK> that come with a big budget and so was more real however what we have here isn't much more than a not as good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket so anyone who has seen that or any one of the other rip offs there of will know what to expect br br the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters with the <UNK> soft kids out of their depth close harmony singing <UNK> <UNK> black <UNK> world weary <UNK> bitter and twisted <UNK> etc etc all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most <UNK> and tension at any given time maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation maybe it was <UNK> or maybe it was just a <UNK> trying to appeal to the biggest audience all i know is it was annoying one novel thing was the mixture of <UNK> and <UNK> where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it this seems to be the main <UNK> of the plot with the <UNK> coming to their senses and the <UNK> gaining a sense of duty and self worth but its all done in a rather forced and <UNK> way the other big bug i had was how all the characters with the exception of the <UNK> and the real <UNK> would react to each inevitable conflict with at first <UNK> and <UNK> of violence faced with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> immediately back down and be all reasonable and <UNK> br br i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads which was strong and very convincing tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters this wasn't too hard br br in my imagination <UNK> grew up to be <UNK> off tour of duty and for my money 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch
<START> i highly recommend this film set in the <UNK> esquire future of <UNK> paris it is in most respect a classic film noir script lady in peril sister trying to find her honest cop fighting everyone luckily it avoids being stereotypical and combines a pretty good storyline with interesting innovative visuals the film might remind you of sin city in look but it has an even <UNK> even more graphic novel look that i found really compelling each frame each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer in terms of story and artwork you can find <UNK> going back to the <UNK> forties or even earlier with the classic views of the <UNK> tower and <UNK> <UNK> and movies like casablanca as well as looking toward a grim future where our <UNK> are ruled by <UNK> make any excuse you need to see this film
<START> one of <UNK> better early efforts the humor is dead on in parts as hung tries to imitate lee's moves and facial expressions and also in a bit where hung <UNK> fun at jackie chan's drunken master the action is also pretty good especially when hung takes on a trio on martial arts experts at the end it's not the greatest film but pretty good for <UNK> kung fu especially if you're a fan of hung and or lee be warned though most video versions of the movie have pretty shoddy quality there is also a character in <UNK> which some people might find offensive br br sammo hung is a rural <UNK> <UNK> who moves to hong kong to fight off some bad guys sammo turns on his dead on bruce lee <UNK> when fighting br br this film is often billed as a parody of bruce lee's enter the dragon but it's not exactly that sammo is a rural <UNK> <UNK> obsessed with bruce lee who moves to hong kong to help his relatives run a small open air restaurant once <UNK> at the new job he is forced to defend the <UNK> from local gangsters looking for protection money when sammo switches into fighting mode he switches on his bruce lee <UNK> which must be seen to be believed this film is pretty sloppy in many of the fight scenes sammo battles against people who are obviously actors rather than martial artists and there's one character who's supposed to be black who is played by an asian man in heavy and preposterous makeup but what this film lacks in budget and accuracy it more than makes up for in atmosphere and energy highly recommended for a good mood
<START> going down as the most expensive film in <UNK> history to date dark floors is a horror film with an extremely <UNK> narrative that <UNK> an ever increasingly <UNK> series of floors ironically enough in an abandoned hospital in which our protagonists are trapped lead by an <UNK> daughter and her father himself <UNK> with the <UNK> apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter make their way into an elevator <UNK> the issue with one of the <UNK> <UNK> accompanied by a security guard a businessman and a seemingly <UNK> tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned but they are not alone directed by <UNK> born pete <UNK> more known for his television work dark floors is filmed in english using mainly english actors but has the notable inclusion of <UNK> arguably most famous group <UNK> 2006 <UNK> song contest winners as themselves i e in their on stage monstrous costumes as the films <UNK> yet for all this <UNK> the production fails where it is needed most in convincing the audience br br any film that has their lead character use the phrase it's too quiet is already headed down a dubious path and this <UNK> influenced horror does not break that convention for all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of <UNK> clichés alongside and worst of all anything that is interestingly original isn't fleshed out enough for it to <UNK> the concept of the <UNK> floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the <UNK> however there isn't enough atmosphere created to scare and <UNK> the audiences into the <UNK> fear the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous as the levels <UNK> from shiny white through to <UNK> black but i don't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening also the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch a concept not often used in the horror genre but the characters don't confront the situation with enough fear and <UNK> when they stumble across this fact they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience these initially good ideas are just left to go to waste as if the director and or mr <UNK> who had many of the ideas used within the film had these thoughts but couldn't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point br br yet for all the frustration there are large <UNK> of comedy yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for too much is clichéd too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous while the lead is <UNK> acted by <UNK> <UNK> the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been <UNK> into the story from other films we have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a <UNK> developed love interest accompanying the couple we have the traditional token black man as a hard <UNK> security guard with the <UNK> on <UNK> clip for his <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> businessman only on the look out for himself worst of all though unfortunately is the introduction of the cast of <UNK> as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of <UNK> but not for them appearing as themselves what makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is <UNK> the fear the shining is scary because it's a member of your own family <UNK> you in dawn of the dead it's our fear of each other and the <UNK> <UNK> and irrational thought <UNK> the zombies possess in alien the fear is explained the creature is <UNK> and in dark floors there is none of that perhaps it's unfair to compare this production to these <UNK> of the genre but when you do it shows it <UNK> significantly and that it's <UNK> feel like nothing more than demented <UNK> where you can almost see the <UNK> on the costumes they wear without a build up of any atmosphere <UNK> just aren't scary br br it's <UNK> because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as hollywood <UNK> out much in the similar way that george a romero started out but it doesn't always <UNK> i enjoyed the film and didn't feel as if i had wasted the ninety minutes i had just sat through but i felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred <UNK> or affected me <UNK> emotionally or <UNK> i felt the almost <UNK> narrative was a standout plus point but it fades out into <UNK> why did it happen what does it mean will they go through this all again without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence had the <UNK> girl watched the <UNK> song contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under who knows and unfortunately i fail to work up the energy to even care dark floors is an <UNK> experience that while ultimately shallow <UNK> potential and at the very least shows a <UNK> of creative <UNK> from mr <UNK> who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas it's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the <UNK> for not having enough light shed on the situation
<START> as winter approaches our state owned <UNK> the abc has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights this <UNK> with a twelve year old movie length version of emma last sunday more recent versions of three other novels <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> park are to come br br the curious thing about this production by a e television networks with script by the ever reliable andrew davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring gwyneth paltrow and clueless a <UNK> version starring alicia <UNK> which transported the plot to beverly hills perhaps as a result even with kate beckinsale in the lead this production <UNK> without trace br br as a general rule much is lost when novels are <UNK> to fit feature movie length the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters an outstanding example is <UNK> <UNK> which had 13 50 minute episodes back in 1982 you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of pride and prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six part tv mini series it's not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film <UNK> is a recent example but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to <UNK> their full charm br br given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is ok kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self <UNK> and vulnerability and mark strong is a <UNK> mr <UNK> he reminded me that jane tended to <UNK> characters  <UNK> is a more <UNK> version of the moody mr <UNK> of p p samantha <UNK> was a rather limp harriet but <UNK> <UNK> got the <UNK> miss bates perfectly  <UNK> <UNK> on speed bernard <UNK> as <UNK> feeble father was also excellent we saw the <UNK> countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly <UNK> age for everybody br br even though this was a <UNK> adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the <UNK> of the times i'd have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots br br if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and <UNK> well with the paltrow version anyway there is more to come
<START> i never quite understood the popularity of <UNK> power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate <UNK> version of <UNK> ultra popular super <UNK> series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects etc br br of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect br br i'm sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super <UNK> is over the american version br br power rangers is completely awful try super <UNK> instead looking for a better show try <UNK> the third dimension instead
<START> not too keen on this really the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing i enjoyed the first 10 minutes bill <UNK> good after that it was pretty appalling tim doesn't fit the role he comes across as a smug self <UNK> ass <UNK> taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a <UNK> player it's a <UNK> film and as a musician feel slightly offended after watching it there's no scenes of <UNK> <UNK> or playing with his fellow band mates he's completely self indulgent i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character maybe i'm watching the wrong film if you have no real passion for life or sense of what <UNK> all about then happily <UNK> in the suspension of disbelief and watch this <UNK>
<START> this <UNK> today on the scifi channel and all i can say is i am speechless i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work i had high hopes now i am <UNK> apart the <UNK> looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway this movie sucks there i said it they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do my nine year old niece could make a better film the only decent thing about this film is the sound and or sound track oh i just found a rusty c <UNK> in my old tool box i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and <UNK> it until the pain <UNK> the memory of what my eyes have seen i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again christmas is coming buy this movie and give it to people you hate mike
<START> i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasn't an option this movie sucks the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadn't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes the idea of black females as <UNK> in the western days is ridiculous it's not just a race thing it's also a gender the combination of the two things is ridiculous i am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors actresses but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be <UNK> to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great movie that's all i have to say about that
<START> this is the kind of film one watches in <UNK> <UNK> horrified silence and yet continues to watch <UNK> as if watching a train wreck in slow motion and yet in the back of your mind thoughts are <UNK> who on earth green <UNK> this garbage br br some of the <UNK> user comments say things like a good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy an insult to children everywhere that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound <UNK> of the nature of children the world over others have commented on the <UNK> of the two <UNK> characterizations of laurel and hardy to which i would respond so what one would think that the <UNK> of movie bombs based on beloved series rocky and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> squad ad <UNK> would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be <UNK> the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this br br as for f murray abraham a fine actor of stage and screen well all i can say is he must have been in trouble with the irs br br run don't walk away from the television if this trash comes on
<START> i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident well it must of been blonde women being stalked the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in <UNK> then disappearing and <UNK> hiding he <UNK> even a super hero so i don't know how he did it he <UNK> <UNK> a cat and that's not hard to do br br the old mirror in the bathroom is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago you had the cop on the trail of the villain another cliché played by <UNK> <UNK> with a very convincing american accent he's from london the director <UNK> have a clue and has made a film full of <UNK> and <UNK> scary move which was a comedy look scary pathetic
<START> i really thought they did an excellent job there was nothing wrong with it at all i don't know how the first <UNK> could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears i guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one got me it was <UNK> good i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i feel like it <UNK> my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain it made me want to <UNK> to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own trials are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma
<START> this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in <UNK> and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
<START> my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show both the early episodes on the n and the later ones on abc family and they love it i wasn't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season i'm curious as to what <UNK> all of the cast changes i've seen them described as highly <UNK> and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes personally i don't see a whole lot of difference the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout but they do lose some great people along the way my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this i also wish they'd done some self <UNK> humor about the changes like on boy meets world where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so and when a different actor later shows up playing her they ask her where she's been and she says upstairs or when early series token geek <UNK> shows up for the high school <UNK> they ask him where he's been and he says over there pointing to the part of the <UNK> never shown by the camera before saying hey mr turner wait up and running off screen mr turner being another character who left oh well maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something i was just glad to see aunt <UNK> show up for the finale she was always one of my favorites it's too bad it couldn't have been a more <UNK> cast reunion the <UNK> candle just didn't cut it for me
<START> if you've ever seen the trailer for the film the <UNK> with colin farrell and al pacino you'll never have to see that film sadly renaissance has had similarly <UNK> trailer makers br br the story of renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical <UNK> the setting is a futuristic paris and science fiction elements feature throughout the special thing about renaissance though is its visual style and not its story renaissance is 3d computer animation like final fantasy but highly <UNK> into black and white with ultra sharp <UNK> the result looks stunning although the problems of 3d animation of human beings are still noticeable from time to <UNK> slightly robotic movements slightly wooden facial acting etc as a highly <UNK> beautiful film noir renaissance succeeds at stunning the audience especially visually the story and writing though are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals it's not a bad story and presumably if you haven't seen the trailer it's a lot more exciting than it was for me but it is a story that isn't highly original and <UNK> on the corny a few lines of dialogue were painfully corny making the writing sound like a <UNK> first efforts br br i will definitely recommend renaissance to friends it's unlike anything i've seen before visually and i believe its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience it is also a watchable story even if it isn't perfect
<START> the perfectly stupid weapon i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven <UNK> movies was <UNK> to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie the plot is predictable the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the <UNK> he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene
<START> i'm not usually given to <UNK> but after seeing over two decades worth of academy awards i can honestly say that this year's awards show was the most <UNK> example of poor direction total cruelty and sheer stupidity that i've ever had the misfortune to witness i'm not talking about the awards themselves as usual there is plenty to argue about when you <UNK> up who won who lost and who never even got nominated but the process is as it's always been and is as fair as it's <UNK> to be what is terribly unfair is the treatment both the stars and non stars received at the hands of <UNK> and <UNK> in the name of <UNK> boredom br br it is bad enough that for the last several years anyone who isn't al pacino has been played off at 45 seconds without any regard for what he was saying how he was saying it and what the emotion was behind the statement it demonstrates nothing more than a total lack of respect however to herd <UNK> on the stage like cattle without paying them the honor of showing their faces while their names are read to make them <UNK> away quietly when they lose to deny them the thrill of a walk to the <UNK> and to force them to read their statements with their backs to the audience all of those things were done to the non stars never mind that the movies wouldn't exist at all without those artists and that most of them only ever get one chance to face their peers and their audience br br the stars didn't fare much better it's becoming more sad than funny when winners of the caliber of <UNK> <UNK> and clint eastwood have to beg for a few extra seconds for their speeches chris rock as host was neither as <UNK> and controversial as the academy had hoped nor nearly as funny as he could be his opening remarks were almost but not quite as offensive as sean penn made them out to be and his comments during the show were more <UNK> than interesting of course he could hardly be blamed when it was clear that was being kept on as short a <UNK> as any host has in the end chris rock was something he's almost never been before a non <UNK> br br even the musical numbers were handled poorly <UNK> sang well but there was simply no reason why she should have been featured in three out of the five songs another example of utter <UNK> for an artist was giving <UNK> <UNK> nominated song to antonio <UNK> even though <UNK> was present and clearly wouldn't have minded singing his own song based on his winning speech br br the efforts of <UNK> and <UNK> to make the show shorter and faster may have worked to a degree but what resulted was a show devoid of life we've all <UNK> about the overlong speeches given by people we don't know about the overblown production about the self <UNK> quality but this is their night not <UNK> what is meant to be a celebration has become an insult to the people being celebrated <UNK> and <UNK> should frankly be ashamed
<START> you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye br br overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over it's a <UNK> br br it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a <UNK> job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lot br br other factors i think are the <UNK> of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a <UNK> 8 out of 10 more like a 7 5 but that's pretty good
<START> this movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet i like barney more than this movie the graphics suck half the movie is animated the deaths suck and over all i was ready to sue the people that made this movie please do not waste hours of your life watching this movie the only good part was when the movie ended this movie is 50 percent jurassic park 1 percent <UNK> and <UNK> 9 percent dumb please do not waste your time watching this movie you will regret it you want to know why this movie sucks well the cover sucked the graphics sucked the blood looked i mean is <UNK> the people tried to blow themselves up the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal i mean there was a 5 <UNK> tiger running straight at a woman she throws a <UNK> at it from 100 <UNK> away wait till you can actually hit it the acting was horrible too <UNK> park is actually a good movie and this just had to go and ruin it
<START> it's unfortunate that you can't go any lower than one star prior to watching the wicker man i had considered aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars in all fairness the wicker man doesn't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film but the fact remains that my <UNK> movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it br br there is a cheap trick all too often used in hollywood when the producers are too <UNK> to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful it is a <UNK> that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and <UNK> upon the producers even more so in that the carefully crafted or however they put it conclusion didn't seem to follow <UNK> from the plot which naturally i can't elaborate on without introducing spoilers and instead <UNK> what merit the plot had up to that point br br it is a film that might <UNK> appeal to <UNK> <UNK> and possibly die hard nicholas cage fans but only to a few of the mainstream audience if you really want something along these lines i <UNK> recommend m night <UNK> the village instead lacking some kind of memory <UNK> <UNK> i suppose i need to watch something better to force it from my mind say attack of the killer tomatoes or pee <UNK> big adventure
<START> this film has <UNK> my interest in french cinema the story is enchanting the acting is flawless and audrey <UNK> is absolutely beautiful i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in <UNK>
<START> by <UNK> d w griffith had been directing films for the <UNK> company for about a year and  working at a rate of two or three per week  was rapidly beginning to develop his skills as a filmmaker 'the sealed <UNK> is a very interesting 11 minute short a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama that even <UNK> slightly into the realm of early horror the simple narrative was probably inspired by edgar allen <UNK> <UNK> short story the <UNK> of <UNK> and concerns a powerful king who <UNK> a deliciously sadistic form of revenge to <UNK> his wife's infidelity br br set in medieval times 'the sealed <UNK> begins with the king arthur v johnson <UNK> the construction of a <UNK> room from a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the idea being that he and his wife marion leonard will have a completely private place to enjoy each other's company he is obviously very much in love with her always showing his affection this latest act the <UNK> achievement of his <UNK> however <UNK> to the king his wife has fallen in love with the royal <UNK> henry b <UNK> during one romantic <UNK> inside the specially built room the wife and the <UNK> are discovered and the <UNK> king <UNK> a means of getting his <UNK> on the ignorant couple <UNK> he orders his <UNK> to seal off the only <UNK> with stone and <UNK> slowly <UNK> into <UNK> insanity as each new stone is placed down br br d w griffith always had an eye for <UNK> detail and 'the sealed <UNK> is an excellent early example of this the lavish medieval century costumes lend the film a sense of reality and the castle interior looks authentic enough to be believable at the time the director was also <UNK> methods of creating suspense and i must admit that as the film progressed i became <UNK> on finding out what would happen to the hapless young lovers in the early minutes griffith <UNK> his shots to lengthy long takes from a <UNK> camera as was usual at the time but soon  parallel to the <UNK> darker subject matter  he <UNK> his editing tactics in a fascinating way though he may not have invented the technique griffith was crucial in <UNK> the use of cross cutting  that is <UNK> between different events occurring at the same time not only does this create a sense of continuity but it also <UNK> the level of suspense since we as the audience are well aware not only of the king's ghastly actions but also that the wife and the <UNK> are oblivious to it all br br despite these <UNK> 'the sealed <UNK> suffers from many of the shortcomings typical of the era the entire film takes place in just two rooms with footage captured from a total of just three positions and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at times the acting performances are greatly exaggerated for extra effect however at least in the case of arthur v johnson his <UNK> actually contributed to <UNK> the <UNK> madness of the betrayed king a moment that i thought particularly effective was when the two lovers attempted to exit the room only to find their only <UNK> replaced with a wall of solid stone their <UNK> reactions accompanied by the silent <UNK> <UNK> of the king serve very well to create an impending sense of <UNK> i did think however that their supply of <UNK> was exhausted surprisingly quickly
<START> this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time the dialogue with the constant use of <UNK> is very tight the cast are superb and the plot is highly original br br don't take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself
<START> i found this movie boring monotonous and quite uninteresting with a <UNK> shallow upbeat ending that didn't ring true to the overall story following these characters through a weekend of awful events <UNK> attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable interesting movie and i got very tired of its one note theme and couldn't wait for it to end in fact i almost stopped about halfway through the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant though the acting was good a small movie with small ambitions and small appeal sorry but it just didn't make it with me and i love good small films this one just didn't <UNK> though i kept watching it hoping and <UNK> that it would i was disappointed especially after two local reviewers put it on their year's 10 best list i'd strongly recommend watching the house of sand instead now there's a good small film
<START> director ron <UNK> is <UNK> insane this ultra low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo john <UNK> who also co wrote a nut job who receives a <UNK> doll from his bitch girlfriend he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs rape and kill not always in that order what starts off as being a balls to the wall exploitation film well stays like that but it gets very repetitive very fast i'm <UNK> more toward the <UNK> insane it is hard to forget once seen though kinda like if tom green ever did a horror film br br my grade f br br eye candy laurie <UNK> gets fully nude <UNK> <UNK> shows tits and bush br br anti eye candy seeing john completely naked repeatedly
<START> i love horror films low budget 50's 60's 70's 80's but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let's compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the <UNK> the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was <UNK> better though still far from great demon seed ok i'll be fair let's compare it to made for tv horror films don't go to sleep <UNK> <UNK> and better done <UNK> lot the night stalker night gallery even don't go in the basement or <UNK> farm were far better spoilers first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden <UNK> comes alive to <UNK> down some <UNK> teenagers terrible also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it's a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or <UNK> it's a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an <UNK> object learned to love <UNK> margaret our protagonist now that i'm on the topic of <UNK> another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse <UNK> her heart out falls in the <UNK> pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn <UNK> life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that's where the <UNK> end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an <UNK> object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven't watched it since it originally aired or remembered it <UNK> them as children this film was pretty much merit less
<START> watching midnight cowboy is like taking a <UNK> in acting directing cinematography editing writing i was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and i have watched it several times since br br everything about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman even though i know this movie well i still find myself <UNK> up every time voight flashes one of his <UNK> <UNK> looks or hoffman <UNK> in his <UNK> and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences br br it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and <UNK> interesting as this one midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools br br 10 10
<START> the book on which this movie is based was excellent it took a while to come to grips with <UNK> unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author's world of sadness in fact no other book has affected me so much this is not necessarily a good thing it <UNK> my own personal struggle and has made the <UNK> of my own struggle harder to accept <UNK> insights are masterfully captured by <UNK> and the hero's <UNK> and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed this is a movie which reveals today's society for the <UNK> male in all its horror hopefully things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat race as shown in this movie it's probably best that <UNK> or <UNK> do not create a work of genius like this again one is enough for any man
<START> if you hit your teens in the 70s as i did you probably remember the stories about studio <UNK> whether or not you liked disco an <UNK> club it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural <UNK> and self <UNK> there's even an excellent <UNK> documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its <UNK> and the stories are easily interesting enough to <UNK> a very captivating film br br sadly this isn't it <UNK> follows the lives of a few of its employees a bartender named <UNK> ryan <UNK> a <UNK> named greg <UNK> meyer his wife a coat check girl anita <UNK> <UNK> and of course the master of <UNK> himself steve <UNK> mike meyers while the goings on at the club are well represented this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers following <UNK> story the closest br br the movie works in <UNK> sometimes it captures perfectly the <UNK> of the <UNK> culture such as when <UNK> is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who <UNK> <UNK> is and other times it <UNK> into hokey melodrama some of that is inherent in the premise  following the <UNK> as they <UNK> in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kid <UNK> treatment with which both the club and <UNK> are given throughout the movie while <UNK> certainly <UNK> the scene in new york with his <UNK> for over the top spectacle and his <UNK> hand picking of the crowds each night the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on and <UNK> himself while his <UNK> are mentioned come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar a cheat a drug <UNK> and <UNK> as all hell not that i was looking for the man to be <UNK> here but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the <UNK> of the <UNK> culture he helped to elevate a final scene where he <UNK> down at the <UNK> <UNK> is so emotionally false as to be <UNK> absurd br br meyers does his best to capture <UNK> but he's given so little to work with here it's surprising his performance is effective but he's good and he helps to anchor the film <UNK> whom i find generally to be a good actor is <UNK> here by the <UNK> and stupidity of his character he's limited to a deer in the <UNK> smile or a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and even he can't translate that into a strong performance <UNK> and meyer are both okay again <UNK> by the writing and <UNK> campbell  <UNK> featured on the dvd cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo br br for some reason i still find myself interested even fascinated by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies but even given that this is not a film that particularly engaged me despite a <UNK> to like it i'd say if that era or that club has any interest for you track down the <UNK> special rather than this middle of the road melodrama
<START> br br an old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out br br this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an <UNK> in the history of japanese cinema long thought lost a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it which fits perfectly with the images it might have been influenced by <UNK> of doctor <UNK> director <UNK> claimed he never saw the german film however it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing and <UNK> portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum to achieve this the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time multiple <UNK> and out of focus <UNK> point of view <UNK> camera angles fast and slow motion <UNK> lighting and <UNK> among others it is also a very complicated film to follow as it has not got <UNK> br br the film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital wind shaking trees and of thunder the unsettling weather <UNK> the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them a former dancer the combination of sounds produced by rain wind and thunder serves as the music that <UNK> the dancer to get into a frantic almost hypnotic dance in another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another <UNK> dance she is being watched by other inmates multiple <UNK> of the dancer represent the <UNK> point of view and their confused view of the world br br these are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the <UNK> <UNK> and view of the sane world br br in three words a must see
<START> all of the people reviewing this film and probably many professional film reviewers just don't get it this film was made with <UNK> sequences and art techniques quite like the works of the great czech filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> if you want to know what i'm talking about i suggest you get any of <UNK> films such as the fabulous world of jules <UNK> baron <UNK> journey to the beginning of time or on the <UNK> if you are unable to locate a film then read the reviews in <UNK> they will explain the <UNK> used if one were to look at <UNK> work and try to compare it to any of the other sci fi fantasy films of the time viewers probably wouldn't have gotten it then either it is unfair to compare either of these <UNK> styles to the standard <UNK> of the day because both <UNK> and hines do not <UNK> they have a style that is unique to them and should be judged for their creativity only if you look at this film from a perspective where you know that he intentionally tried to create a <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> mixed with live action you could easily come to the conclusion that he did a masterful job it isn't easy making a bunch of computer <UNK> flow i thought that the creatures were also quite good also considering how they were made hines took a great <UNK> and i think his film will not be fairly judged for years to come someone promoting the film should have <UNK> the audience off as to what they would be seeing rather than let them <UNK> go into the theater expecting the usual cg work regarding the actors i think hines also took a page from <UNK> book in that many of <UNK> actors were somewhat <UNK> at first but became much more engaging as the film and action went on it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library i will watch it for years to come all three great hours of it
<START> please do not waste any money on this movie it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids i couldn't finish watching it and usually i like watching all kinds of b movies how on earth could they find a <UNK> for it funny however check out <UNK> for dark area the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind maybe he got loads of money from the producers money that should have been spend on actors camera and editing even that wouldn't have helped since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film unfortunately dark area has already gotten too much attention please director producer and author of this movie stop making movies like that you are not doing yourself a favor the world would be a better place without this film
<START> i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn <UNK> green and promptly <UNK> and the disgusting acting the acting in fact is what i feel steals the show i didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie and i hope that i never have to see any of them again overall i recommend renting this movie if you can find it i can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash
<START> and i mean ultra light this film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that br br there really isn't too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn't very funny nor does it work at all as a romance how about as a romantic comedy not on your life most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing br br what's really <UNK> is the premise is not bad at all this movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics the film <UNK> the un <UNK> territory of the press <UNK> those all expense paid <UNK> for <UNK> who almost always write nice reviews but instead of exploring what should have been a <UNK> of jokes it <UNK> all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance br br the same with catherine zeta jones' character the <UNK> self centered movie star zeta jones does a good job with what she's given but she's given practically nothing it's all <UNK> junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we've heard about stars over the years br br in the end it is hard to understand what made zeta jones julia roberts john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a <UNK> of the love boat in fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal it would probably make a better story so go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
<START> marie <UNK> carries this depression era drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the <UNK> polly <UNK> team you'll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film it's also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from mgm leonard smith's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the <UNK> up the camera and don't move <UNK> school frequently to the <UNK> of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen it's like a pan and <UNK> print before such existed or having their heads cut off the film doesn't even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production overall it's an unsatisfying mess with <UNK> frequently over <UNK> and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart
<START> spoiler included some would say br br this film is not possible to take seriously at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can't help laughing at it all try me for the sequence where <UNK> character jumps some 20 <UNK> with full climbing gear or and this is really my favorite <UNK> a bad guy by sticking him onto a <UNK> yeah what <UNK> strength did he <UNK> to accomplish such <UNK> i <UNK> but he sure gives reality a run for the money
<START> i'm not a fan of adam sandler in fact i don't think i've ever liked him in anything i've seen him in the opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears there was adam sandler playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around new york city on a <UNK> <UNK> looking pitiful and lost typical sandler type loser character again i thought i almost gave up then and there but then as i stuck with this i actually discovered something i never knew before adam sandler can act he is truly outstanding in this movie as charlie a lost and lonely figure whose entire family including the dog was killed in one of the <UNK> planes on 9 11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result don cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly <UNK> with charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better of course <UNK> alan johnson has his own problems and sources of <UNK> and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties the two of them made a completely believable team and sandler in particular made charlie real working through his emotions and feelings this is not a sandler comedy if your looking for that go to some of his other <UNK> stuff this is a pretty heavy movie sometimes sad sometimes hopeful and always engrossing there are some funny parts in it i loved the scene in which charlie convinces alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college and then the conversation the two of them have afterward br br i personally didn't think that <UNK> <UNK> added much to the movie as donna an obviously <UNK> patient of <UNK> the only reason for the character seemed based on one flashback to be that she looked <UNK> like charlie's late wife but that was never really developed and i just didn't care that much for the character do look for the part of the judge however played by donald sutherland who i thought nailed the part bang on as far as i'm concerned though this is <UNK> movie and kudos to him for a great performance definitely his best in my opinion 8 10
<START> br br have you ever felt like your being watched like someone keeps <UNK> on every move you make well just remember before you decide to break the law the fbi will always be there at least that's the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly <UNK> crime drama the fbi story it <UNK> the roots of the organization from a small <UNK> to one of the most modern <UNK> in the world in 1959 by telling the story through they eyes of one of its agents chip <UNK> james stewart br br chip was with the fbi from day one and he gladly puts his job above everything else in the world even occasionally his family the fbi story tracks his life by depicting what he does as an agent and how being one affects his personal life the film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of cases the fbi handles and how they handle them the audience gets to see chip stop <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> go undercover to solve an indian murder estate scandal bring <UNK> into custody rescue <UNK> and helped fight in wwii he even helped bring communist spies to justice br br stewart in a vaguely complex performance is stellar as always as the slightly neurotic agent who loves his job maybe a little too much one of the best parts about this film is that we get to see the inside <UNK> of both <UNK> family life and his job we witness him suffer through the death of his best friend and then his son we also observe his wife having a <UNK> and his marriage having rocky times almost all of his personal problems are caused by love of his job vera miles gives a <UNK> performance but it's very convincing none the less she was never a brilliant actress but there was always something very attractive and <UNK> about her well maybe that's just me sadly none of the other performances are worth mentioning but the attention grabbing story managed to keep me exceedingly interested br br the cinematography of this film was impressive especially the scenes in the south american <UNK> the colors all had a <UNK> that really set the atmosphere of the film perhaps the greatest part of this movie was <UNK> <UNK> fabulous direction every scene was so fluid they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story it's chock full of ingenious camera shots some with a very <UNK> feel br br all in all the fbi story is a spectacular but overlooked film <UNK> in at two and a half hours some viewers might be <UNK> but if you get the chance i recommend jumping into this one i enjoyed jimmy stewart's spectacular performance and the captivating story
<START> there is no denying that ealing comedies are good but for me this film stands out as one of the best br br the basic premise of the film is that a small part of <UNK> in london is discovered to be part of <UNK> not the uk we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes and keep out the black market <UNK> who soon realise that being <UNK> from uk law <UNK> does not exist when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the <UNK> we see them fight back against the system br br they are forced to <UNK> water and food in their stand for what is right in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that's where the moral comes in it's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food <UNK> of it thus <UNK> them to continue their struggle br br this film <UNK> the right note throughout the acting is superb with stanley <UNK> margaret <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and betty warren standing out it's pitched just right not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat well worth a viewing
<START> i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that i didn't this movie has a very hard time following and or staying to a plot if someone tells you it's a comedy don't be fooled it's about 98 percent odd drama and 2 comedy all actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what this had potential and instead it was really a flop i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time save your money and see something else
<START> i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety was there actually a point to the film and the ending well im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film br br im not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life if so was it an attempt to kick start her career if so im afraid it must have failed br br i post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film even if 1 person takes <UNK> of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint <UNK> i will feel i have made some good in the world if only i had had the same advice
<START> this is the most compelling and excellent performance that robert taylor ever gave it even surpasses his wonderful performance as johnny eager coming a full 14 years after that film his looks are still a wonder to see but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty violent role charlie <UNK> taylor is the last of his breed a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure his wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings is stunning to watch he is basically a lonely man needing the people around him but they dislike him because of his <UNK> behavior his partner is sandy <UNK> stewart granger who is sick of the hunt and only goes along because he is a failure at anything else along the way charlie kills a family of indians and captures the beautiful debra <UNK> charlie tries to seduce her to no <UNK> but sees that sandy is interested in her also granger is kind of sad to watch so fed up with the hunt longing to go away with the girl and her baby lloyd nolan as the drunken <UNK> is wonderful with his wise cracks and <UNK> playing russ <UNK> plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world the group is an odd mix of good and evil young and old in the end taylor gets <UNK> by the buffalo as many hunters before him had and runs off leaving sandy with the girl upon his return that night sandy leaves with the woman setting charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get sandy and have the girl for himself the final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it it is <UNK> film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era
<START> i had my doubts about another love story <UNK> disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication and it's still not at the top of my list but the performances from helena bonham carter and kenneth branagh and <UNK> almost stunning and rescue this from being just another tear <UNK> <UNK> depiction of an <UNK> victim is strong perhaps even overdone at times sometimes her dialog <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> but the overall effect is commendable and rewarding branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance br br
<START> i have to admit i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my <UNK> film class but this film really blew me away the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film truly portraying a picture of madness i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs american in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the <UNK> film always with the happy ending <UNK> the imagination very little
<START> saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic <UNK> to the system a semi surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture or the lack of it focusing on some seriously <UNK> way beyond the hollywood <UNK> <UNK> it had an amusing early performance from mark <UNK> and some memorable cinematography from the <UNK> who did the polish brothers movies there was a savage <UNK> humor and a <UNK> original feel to it that definitely set it apart this film had cult classic written all over it and i'm surprised it's not yet out on dvd br br hopefully soon
<START> this is an incredible film i can't remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered it's funny it's tragic it's compelling and most of all it's a slice of swedish small town life it <UNK> the clichés and <UNK> deeper it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters br br big city girl <UNK> back to her roots her small hometown to celebrate her father's <UNK> birthday crossing paths with people she hasn't met in several years although the story itself isn't unique it offers a fresh approach the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters on different stages in life who aren't very close or at least don't realize how close they are br br one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the <UNK> cast first i'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so called 'a <UNK> swedish actors in this film usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession <UNK> <UNK> is probably the first swedish actress since eva <UNK> to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion br br the writing is also very appealing the dialogue is more than believable and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two it's ahead by miles maria <UNK> controls everything from the beginning and if you didn't know you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film i can't wait for her next one br br once you start watching this you really want to see it through
<START> everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating br br please please please please please do not <UNK> yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
<START> black guy becomes rich white guy and rich white guy seems to embrace hip hop culture and most of the funny moments of this film play off of this the problem i have is that it doesn't work and almost never works br br ok so no one would expect lance to grab a body like that and suddenly start acting like charles <UNK> that would be too much to ask i'll grant that but at the same time it goes too far the other direction i'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely <UNK> things playing like he's a <UNK> of hip hop culture and people just accept him and what about <UNK> who falls in love with him as a rich white guy even though she doesn't care about his money or power this is so completely unbelievable it's not even funny br br i just couldn't suspend disbelief and i couldn't finish the movie i added one extra star because it did make me laugh even hard a couple of times but i just couldn't get get past the whole white guy doing hip hop thing that has never been well done in any movie i've ever seen that tries it this was no exception
<START> special effects good br br script terrible no plot no depth no meaning this film rendered superman as a meaningless hero a hero with no <UNK> in the original film he represented america in the cold war here he represented nothing but a hulk br br sure the actors were fine kevin spacey was a fine choice among others br br this still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever i cannot see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film when superman was and is daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds this was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken br br just a few instances lex luthor could have been a villain of global <UNK> political <UNK> <UNK> and on and on and on he was just another <UNK> hackman incarnation br br and superman for what did he stand in this film nothing but another hack <UNK> figure br br wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all
<START> made by french brothers jules and <UNK> <UNK> and narrated by robert de niro and <UNK> james <UNK> this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new <UNK> finest <UNK> on it's darkest day i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old and at that age it still touched me knowing how serious 9 11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9 11 we were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their <UNK> these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just <UNK> my admiration for them watch if you can this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen
<START> <UNK> has done some great movies but this a turkey it has a feel of a play written by an <UNK> high school student for his class assignment the set decoration is appealing in a somewhat <UNK> way but the actual story is <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about so i taped this film during the early hours of the am if you ever wanted to see what <UNK> had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine <UNK> in on the men this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after <UNK> i and how the germans came to the aid of the french <UNK> much to the <UNK> of the french <UNK> the actors were all outstanding with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine there is an old old retired <UNK> who <UNK> to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down if you are a real film buff this is a film you will not want to miss
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> show the triumph of the human spirit for stanley it's the struggle to become <UNK> and realize his potential for <UNK> it's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope
<START> spoiler do not read this if you think about watching that movie although it would be a waste of time by the way the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway br br if you are wondering whether to see <UNK> ugly or not don't it's not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs dvd a typical chick feel good flick one could say the plot itself is as shallow as it can be a ridiculous and <UNK> version of the american dream the young good looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail such as the tragic accident of the father the difficulties of <UNK> relationship with her boyfriend and so on <UNK> director tries to <UNK> the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting especially <UNK> <UNK> completely fails in convincing one of <UNK> fear of singing in front of an audience the only good and quite funny thing about <UNK> ugly is john goodman who represents the small ray of hope of this movie br br i was very <UNK> that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie first gone in 60 seconds and now this what happened to great movies like the rock and con air that was true bruckheimer stuff br br if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening you should better go and see charlie's angels it's much more funny entertaining and self ironic instead of this flick br br two thumbs down 3 out of 10
<START> regarded by many critics as one of the biggest <UNK> of all time certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career br br <UNK> mccoy tom hanks is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria <UNK> <UNK> griffith are involved in a hit and run his story is <UNK> by another smug guy reporter peter <UNK> bruce willis br br well as i said in my summary br br what is this movie supposed to be it seems to combine comedy drama and satire but it sure doesn't add up to much it's <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> one dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the <UNK> of meeting in real life br br i'm no big fan of the novel i started reading it once but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking but it's obvious to me that those who did do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty br br i've never seen so many talented actors <UNK> to hard to give a below average movie some semblance of quality and fail what a waste br br the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic and the role of peter <UNK> in the novel was that of a brit bruce willis is badly badly miscast in the role what was the thinking there br br alas not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact being <UNK> to deliver a lame heavy handed lecture on <UNK> after the climax br br this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce br br i liked the <UNK> of talent for that i will give it four out of ten but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material
<START> just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years i'm sure most of the people who watched this <UNK> crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the 1960s never was much of an actor at all by his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father plays his son in the series
<START> simply put this is the worst movie since police academy mission to <UNK> if you liked that movie you will probably like this one br br what were they thinking some ideas should stay just that an idea the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense br br what was so bad about it i hear you ask one word everything br br cost to hire 4 50 cost in time to watch <UNK> minutes br br i want a <UNK> on both
<START> there are few comedies like this where almost every line and every character come close to flawless this is <UNK> funny and it has quite a bit of satire there to sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good if not perfect job with her daytime tv <UNK> sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top but 90 of the time she is a riot in the same league is kevin kline robert downey jr and <UNK> goldberg who unfortunately has too little to do here downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time but he struggles with his part which is to be honest the most <UNK> one but the shining star here is cathy <UNK> as <UNK> a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret you will see in the absolutely stunning finale sadly <UNK> <UNK> never seems to be quite comfortable in her part i normally like ms <UNK> but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie but it is not something <UNK> and for the most part she is at least adequate otherwise <UNK> with memorable lines and situations this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever
<START> i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13 1974 i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by <UNK> <UNK> hey where's the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally <UNK> that the reason it <UNK> when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren <UNK> carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he <UNK> like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat <UNK> menace is being <UNK> in that episode it's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force he's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a <UNK> as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a <UNK> but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself he's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him he's a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didn't work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation that's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for <UNK> if you don't care about the characters darren <UNK> said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i <UNK> when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred <UNK> as the bumbling determined and <UNK> but good hearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show it's not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to it's success is right there in the title kolchak the night stalker without <UNK> lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain't a night stalker
<START> this show is not clever that's basically what it <UNK> down to the original humor that these writers try to pull off to avoid completely biting off the rest of the worlds bush bashing is just unfunny in another comment someone quotes a couple hilarious lines the standout for me was george h w bush telling the kids they're not supposed to watch any tv besides fox news wow i thought the episodes i saw were bad the fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic br br my problem with drivel like this sad excuse for political satire is that these folks are getting a second season i'm a liberal <UNK> and i know bush hasn't been a good president we all do but that's no excuse for putting out this utterly <UNK> waste of time i place these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind <UNK> the <UNK> their formula bite off as many already unfunny <UNK> jokes as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit br br again just plain bad unfunny and it just makes me more and more unhappy that crap like this is <UNK> but amazing and original shows like arrested development are <UNK> after 3 solid seasons please don't watch this crap unless you're one of those green blooded liberal hippies who think any sentence with the words bush and dumb is comedic gold br br oh and the voice of bush sucks all he does is slightly <UNK> a <UNK> accent and <UNK> really hard at the end of his sentences at least south park admits the voices aren't accurate if you want funny political satire watch daily show <UNK> or look for any political sketches on robot chicken which is fun to watch since the stop motion action figure animation is extremely well done look for the george bush as a jedi bit on youtube priceless
<START> a very cheesy and dull road movie with the intention to be hip and modern shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles resulting only in <UNK> br br the cast is wasted the writing is stupid and pretentious the only thing worthwhile is the top notch <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack really cool and also the opening sequence very original and interesting br br run if you can the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage of course that this has its charm of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire but save it for a <UNK> day where you have absolutely nothing else to do
<START> soap opera about a small town married woman kay francis who works at the local <UNK> performs as leading lady in her local <UNK> but dreams of becoming a star on broadway when a famous actor who is a ham a <UNK> and a <UNK> to boot arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her <UNK> to stardom he pretends his <UNK> is his manager <UNK> her into believing she has all it takes but experience to become a big star her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected a life prison sentence for <UNK> next thing you know she's joined a traveling <UNK> show in hopes of one day making it to broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom all the while her baby is sleeping in a <UNK> br br this film has a pretty interesting plot well a bit far fetched perhaps but very melodramatic with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it all greatly enhanced by the strong emotional performance given by kay francis she just makes this film also helping here is the well done acting by <UNK> <UNK> in her role as a getting close to forty older lady who works the <UNK> and befriends kay worth seeing especially for kay francis fans
<START> this was really a very bad movie i am a huge fan of italian horror <UNK> mario <UNK> fulci and yes even our good friend here <UNK> sometimes comes out with a good one i found the first two <UNK> films to be highly entertaining they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really really bad it is intensely boring the story never goes anywhere and i hated the characters the wife <UNK> husband and whiny cry baby pain in the wife drove me mad there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film i turned it off about three quarters of the way through because i was very very bored don't bother
<START> this film has it all the <UNK> camera work reminiscent of martin <UNK> or oliver stone the tight acting of <UNK> the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say 'the <UNK> br br the judge <UNK> character displays a fiery <UNK> yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity his performance reminds me of robert de <UNK> portrayal of jake la <UNK> in raging bull br br the action scenes are truly breathtaking not since <UNK> has a movie depicted such high <UNK> yet stylish car scenes the special effects push the <UNK> of technology and filmmaking to their limits <UNK> day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched and greatly <UNK> br br overall great acting from its a list cast like an oscars night party <UNK> list classy locations gripping action and a tight script
<START> cuba gooding jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the u s president i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why he teams up with a <UNK> news reporter angie <UNK> to <UNK> the conspiracy surrounding the <UNK> death and so on blah blah blah br br even with a cast of james woods cuba gooding jr anne archer and angie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie well it doesn't the writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters br br 4 10 it's boring predictable and dull
<START> you can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator this film features this device throughout richard <UNK> not entirely content to write direct and even <UNK> some of this film adds to his credits by reading <UNK> of his own semi <UNK> writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to <UNK> over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be <UNK> for genuine art house kevin <UNK> puts in a good performance everyone else is okay br br budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night though if you know serious <UNK> they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism br br the funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that <UNK> between her appearances a more extreme version of the problem <UNK> has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes bless
<START> you've never seen anything like it once the coup begins it's the most dazzling edge of your seat thriller you'll ever see even though you know the outcome and it's all real because it's a documentary amazing br br by the time it was over it was on my top 10 list of all time great movies br br disregard the <UNK> right wing fanatics everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the 4 star rating even if you don't care about politics or about <UNK> politics you will find yourself nerve <UNK> and believe it on the edge of your seat br br it's a roller coaster ride
<START> i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature length film a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini series it was really great gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well <UNK> rich girl and jeremy northam is mr <UNK> with his <UNK> and <UNK> i wasn't thrilled with ewan <UNK> even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all like i said as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than <UNK> for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really <UNK> the story well i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
<START> as a matter of fact this is one of those movies you would have to give 7 5 to the fact is as already stated it's a great deal of fun wonderfully atmospheric <UNK> does indeed come across as over the top but it's a great vehicle for him just as oh mr porter is for will <UNK> if you like old dark house movies and trains then this is definitely for you br br strangely enough it's the kind of film that you'll want to see again and again it's friendly and charming in an endearing sort of way with all of the nostalgic references that made great wartime fare the <UNK> band of characters simply play off each other as they do in many another typical british wartime movie it would have been wonderful to have seen this film if it had been recorded by ealing studios a real pity that the 1931 original has not survived intact
<START> you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  <UNK> fully loaded with crap and yes it is true this movie is really dreadful and totally lame br br this got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie i don't see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it br br what i didn't like about this movie is also base on how <UNK> is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a <UNK> car after all it just a <UNK> i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable br br final words unless the kids are actually 5 12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie what <UNK> of my money i feel like cheated br br rating 3 10 grade f
<START> to be <UNK> with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didn't go into theaters the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used there are a few dull moments when the story's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday <UNK> the props it should the very first part of the movie is <UNK> why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the <UNK> boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer the property he <UNK> turns out to be where the witch tooth fairy lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger don't wanna give anything really away just a little info if you've wanted to see this movie then do so it's worth the price of the rental
<START> i find i enjoy this show but the format needs some work first off the good attributes i like how this show will take us through the day to day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they've allowed their lives to become this is followed by an <UNK> which is then followed by an outcome <UNK> doesn't candy coat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome this makes the positive <UNK> all the better br br another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work given the reality that these <UNK> have to squeeze anywhere and don't have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable it's actually superior to scripted shows like the shield where the photography is so bad it can <UNK> <UNK> br br now for the bad an episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show you'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you're thrown into the story of another get caught up in that story then suddenly you're back to the first addict or are you by now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to this constant flip <UNK> between <UNK> really gets <UNK> during the <UNK> scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated <UNK> i once heard the marketing b s reason for this poor design the show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to <UNK> what they're watching oh please clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren't big enough for an hour show so they mix two together by mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the other br br i used to find these <UNK> episodes so annoying that i'd only tell my <UNK> to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them
<START> absolute garbage worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc br br truly dire acting not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden <UNK> br br watch it just for how truly bad this film is it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s br br if you like real fight movies then check out tony <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> those are proper martial arts films br br have a laugh and watch this today you may see the <UNK> humour at how grim it is
<START> i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn't live up to the trailer it's a little more <UNK> and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i'm seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie br br however if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it's still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star she's so <UNK> and <UNK> that set among the <UNK> of everyone else she just <UNK> and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lee's <UNK> filled <UNK> his elegant mother in law his <UNK> friend jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of <UNK> and <UNK> that make stiles stand out in the first place br br lee doesn't live up to his <UNK> i don't think but you could view that as more that they're hard to live up to maybe that's one source of disappointment br br the movie itself despite a bit of <UNK> and a few jokes that don't come off as funny as the writer's intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of <UNK> and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly <UNK> on several layers for example there was the whole <UNK> of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone <UNK> or just how everything <UNK> blair and julia <UNK> characters said and did was <UNK> by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the <UNK> choice br br the other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the <UNK> guy turning out to be a good chef and some <UNK> on his part gets away with it for the most part br br while it wasn't as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of <UNK> talent but overall it's still a good movie
<START> is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable i think not basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension so for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it's a failure this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely i mean no way this could ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events occur in this movie so the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem br br but it truly are the clichés that killed the movie it was cringing stuff at times everything is so formulaic in this movie the predator is portrayed as a cool heartless almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman who acts like she didn't see any of this coming everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason such as the sequence in which the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> broken car that has got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book i knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point i tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other <UNK> the eyes of the other persons around them it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that i almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point the movie is filled with moments like these br br the title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for tv movie which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends <UNK> its time on character development and unnecessary sub plots to make the movie even more drama like br br i'll admit that elizabeth <UNK> is pretty good acting in this movie she makes some of the clichés and events look even almost realistic at times her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie <UNK> so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one it's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better all of the other characters are a disappointment corey <UNK> plays the cliché pretty <UNK> rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence he wakes up he wants sex before he goes to sleep he wants sex he gets home he wants sex it might be a realistic thing but i don't know it just didn't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general br br a cliché filled movie and i can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie it's predictable and <UNK> also lacks in suspense and credibility not an <UNK> movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and cliché elements in the movie also make this far from a <UNK> one br br 4 10
<START> i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but i just got back from this movie and felt i had to express my opinions let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development i know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like a terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has a pretty boy with a cute <UNK> knife and when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have a horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing i ask does this still count as a horror movie nope i'd call it more of a comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semi pro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked but thats another story i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake which made me mad i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake where will horror go next
<START> as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with real life news tv anchor people from buffalo and for once it doesn't knock the area <UNK> br br <UNK> wise <UNK> <UNK> god is still made to look and think like humans and of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill <UNK> minutes br br there are some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences from christians to <UNK> got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what <UNK> should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that <UNK> correct and giving a good message br br overall it's a good hearted film that should offend very few
<START> the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr cox was bald although we probably all realized it at the same time this week dr cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them the latest episode when our favorite grumpy jesus loving nurse roberts dies dr cox <UNK> his head the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity for shame <UNK> they've made mistakes like this before i remember when elliot is trying to date scott <UNK> and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her i try not to notice these things but my favorite show needs to step it up
<START> after enjoying this show for years i use to dream of being able to see them all again and share them with my <UNK> i am so happy to pay a small amount for the memories that i have found recorded on dvd florida was a caring mother with a loving hard working husband one spoiled beautiful daughter and two sons as different as day and night michael the baby son is a freedom walker and <UNK> is a clown i know many <UNK> americans disliked this show but i know many can relate and should have accepted it as it was my heart was sad when i learned that <UNK> <UNK> had passed tyler perry is now the leading writer actor of today and i support his work but not as much since he made such cruel mocking of <UNK> in one of his plays no one should have to hear ugly things about physical appearance the show started getting less interesting when daddy james died it picked up a bit when florida <UNK> but <UNK> when she took an absence from the show in all the show was great and again i am pleased to own copies of part of my past i do try to keep up with the work of the former stars of good times and i must say they are one group who has not been wiped up and down with rumors i think children of today will enjoy this show and i have no problem sitting and watching with children <UNK> to the writer crew and stars for years of <UNK> memories of a time that i can once again enjoy without having to skip scenes br br ok so i watch the shows over and over lately i have noticed thing that has made me <UNK> the series but not dislike them i think florida was a bit harsh when it came to money that the children made not that the children did not need <UNK> but it was done in a way that makes <UNK> <UNK> different the scenes where florida had to speak about how other people were not very good looking bothers me now when james was alive the show made a big thing out of james wanting his own fix it shop but never lived to see his family out of the projects but florida marries someone who owns a fix it shop a bit of a slap in the face to an actor who should have ended his time on good times showing that he accomplished all he <UNK> for lastly as i watch the shows i see the series going in to <UNK> and being <UNK> <UNK> to be truthful after james left everything mostly centered around <UNK> not a bad thing just a noticeable thing i would not trade my dvd's for any amount of money but time maturity and experience began to guide your eyes after a while
<START> i can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel <UNK> to warn others to avoid it at all costs when one of the main characters <UNK> that he's gay twice in the first five minutes don't ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won't if his <UNK> boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick then be thankful the freak who wrote and or directed this <UNK> is somehow attempting a little restraint i mean get real it's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the <UNK> supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of closure over the sudden death of her daughter what does one thing have to do with the other one might be tempted to ask apparently the two issues are <UNK> <UNK> and if that weren't bad enough there's the <UNK> lady at the ice cream <UNK> i mean seriously hasn't that poor woman ever heard of <UNK> why must she go around like that at the very least how about <UNK> the ugly thing off and while you're at it have those horrible <UNK> removed too would you <UNK> up some ice cream she just served you i think not it must be a new jersey thing br br you'd think diane keaton might save this piece of <UNK> but think again was she actually trying to put <UNK> on a corpse i don't even wanna think about it so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter this grotesque excuse for cinema is <UNK> from the word go and that's all there is to it one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going none of these <UNK> people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant trust me pass this piece of crap up it's not about death a mother who inadvertently <UNK> her daughter or even the other much more <UNK> issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it it's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director
<START> why the crap is this movie rated so low i've seen this movie over 25 times i know every line to this movie it's obvious that i love this movie <UNK> parker and matt stone creators of south park and the new puppet masterpiece team america star as the main characters joe cooper or coop <UNK> cooper and doug <UNK> or sir <UNK> mainly they're just referred to as coop and <UNK> throughout the movie right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of <UNK> sports starts they even go as far as to make one up called <UNK> i must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts and after playing for new england san diego huston saint louis a year for the toronto <UNK> plus one season as a greater at the desert <UNK> i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami his agent <UNK> over <UNK> let us not forget this important piece of the movie so it starts that coop and <UNK> are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates outside they create the sport baseketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes after <UNK> them the sport goes pro in about a year during this time they manage to <UNK> their third team mate <UNK> which is actually a day after they <UNK> the game as the movie follows we find out that coop <UNK> and <UNK> are the only <UNK> sports heroes left the story follows with zany blackmail the <UNK> beers <UNK> and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more watch it dude it's hilarious
<START> the <UNK> point in the title is appropriate albeit an understatement this movie doesn't just cry it <UNK> loud enough to <UNK> glass br br filmmakers andrew and virginia stone made shrill <UNK> suspense thrillers that <UNK> for a semi documentary feel here they shot on actual new york locations with <UNK> real life <UNK> to jack up the <UNK> but the <UNK> of the sound recording only serves to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> dialog and the mouth <UNK> <UNK> of tortured <UNK> <UNK> stevens br br in a performance completely devoid of <UNK> stevens plays the wife of <UNK> <UNK> james mason looking <UNK> and bored both are held captive by <UNK> rod <UNK> looking <UNK> and bored and his slimy <UNK> in a scheme to blackmail an <UNK> with a deadly bomb that mason has <UNK> helped <UNK> br br here is another credibility <UNK> instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly <UNK> to every detail yet <UNK> enough to hire a drug addicted <UNK> as an <UNK> the <UNK> idea of nail biting tension is to trap the hysterical stevens alone with <UNK> popping rapist <UNK> brand filling the frame with his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the camera work is so <UNK> and brand so <UNK> <UNK> that the effect is hardly lurid much less suspenseful the stones a square pair at heart don't even have the courage of their own lack of <UNK> br br the film which ends with the <UNK> <UNK> chasing the fleet <UNK> stevens on a subway train track is as clumsy as its <UNK> heavy with angie dickinson as <UNK> amoral girlfriend jack <UNK> kenneth <UNK> and barney <UNK>
<START> the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue <UNK> both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice so my only <UNK> here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think <UNK> <UNK> excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually <UNK> a swear word samantha <UNK> was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd
<START> br br i am a big time horror sci fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a <UNK> covered in fake blood or <UNK> that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning <UNK> store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very <UNK> low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than <UNK> red zone cuba <UNK> and godzilla vs <UNK> despite their higher budgets 10 <UNK> try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues epitome of <UNK> bad made movies etc ad <UNK> <UNK> 10
<START> i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was <UNK> fresh and witty if you look at the <UNK> figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place that's why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is <UNK> to men it could easily be a 7 rated movie
<START> can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting nazis occult time travel etc but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured <UNK> writing family guy using <UNK> <UNK> did these <UNK> also write <UNK> its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them all together and then to make things make even less sense included a <UNK> <UNK> esquire time travel theme to the ending messing up the <UNK> br br i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd the acting wasn't great but in fairness i've seen worse i will praise the nazi paintings they were creepy but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic br br i don't have a <UNK> against this movie or anything but to be honest i'm not even into the horror genre but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama if this story had been well told this would have been a good movie but it has been over hyped <UNK> over hyped
<START> extremely dull drama starring a very young <UNK> <UNK> who trains a wild horse the <UNK> of the title and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place <UNK> in <UNK> overbearing music and <UNK> down by <UNK> dialogue this is one of those interminable films that <UNK> you to the point of a <UNK> headache the <UNK> titled sequel <UNK> son of <UNK> in which <UNK> trains the next generation of <UNK> is <UNK> better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to <UNK> you into <UNK> although there are at least one or two scenes that don't <UNK> a coma
<START> it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black have been situation spoofs which have <UNK> <UNK> in originality and generally laughs i found the sheer absurdity of <UNK> utterly hilarious when it was released <UNK> and <UNK> was also enjoyable and then <UNK> kept the laughs going for a lot of people although personally i was a bit tired of the over the top characters especially when the scenario wasn't quite so funny perhaps the comedy of a <UNK> <UNK> doesn't quite translate to australia where it's rarely played so in an attempt to do something a little more original envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack <UNK> character i won't spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie the problem is that the movie seems to drag i'm not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before and very rarely successfully so instead of a nice crisp enjoyable and fresh comedy you get a film that seems to just go through the motions sure the motions can be quite amusing and they're <UNK> on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing though a bit <UNK> creator ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost he's asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his <UNK> breed of movies but he struggles as a family man whether his fault or the scripts there isn't enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious the performance doesn't leave an <UNK> on the viewer he's just ben stiller jack black manages to actually portray a character though not a challenging one the last annoying element of the movie is christopher <UNK> role as 'the j man' which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly br br it's really not as unbearable as some people would have you think it's watchable especially if you're in the right mood feeling silly would be a good <UNK> for seeing this film hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after you've watched a scary film and feel like something light hopefully you'll also be somewhat <UNK> by then too in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along
<START> beautifully done a lot of angst friendship may not endure all but in the end it's all that matters or so a group of friends learn i have watched it over and over again the music is also amazing when <UNK> loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho an orphan boy who is not <UNK> by his true nature in the <UNK> streets of <UNK> they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does i couldn't get enough of it gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting proving they are more than pretty boys who sing
<START> the movie held my interest mainly because <UNK> keaton is my favorite actress i disagree with some of the other <UNK> on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted i had no trouble following it maybe some people had too much <UNK> the night before the movie was very sad and touching as well what more do you want <UNK> <UNK> is a fine new talent beautiful too and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not it was <UNK> sad but <UNK> it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
<START> after realizing what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week in my town br br i started looking for this series 3 days ago <UNK> t have luck till this moment and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs br br people i believe they stopped the show because it's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying br br the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the <UNK> with the one eye
<START> although <UNK> version is more famous <UNK> work is not devoid of interest far from it its <UNK> sequences are even better the metaphor of the train perhaps borrowed from the ending of <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> is eventually more convincing than the up above heavenly world br br <UNK> <UNK> for his characters shows in <UNK> character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects the ending of three <UNK> the amusement park seems to be everywhere we see it even when we are in <UNK> poor house i do not think that the sets are that much cheesy they are stylized to a fault the fair from a distance almost gives a sci fi feel to the movie br br <UNK> never forgets his social concerns in the heavenly train going up the rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the <UNK> but as chief <UNK> tells here there's no more difference br br not a major work for <UNK> neither is <UNK> version but to seek out if you are interested in the great director's career
<START> i am a back batman movie and tv fan i loved the show new and old and i loved all the movies but this movie is not as great as some people were <UNK> it to be in my <UNK> it is a big let down i think the problem was it had no drama batman mask of the phantasm and batman beyond return of the joker had a lot of drama and batman mr freeze sub zero had some drama too also i think this movie is to light for batman the only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with <UNK> at the end anyways it's an ok batman movie but i would just rent it
<START> stella starring bette midler in the title role is an <UNK> <UNK> set in <UNK> new york stella claire works nights as a bar maid <UNK> and dancing in a <UNK> saloon one night in comes a <UNK> medical <UNK> stephen dallas who <UNK> stella and in the course of their affair <UNK> her she <UNK> both his offers of marriage and abortion sends him <UNK> to a <UNK> medical career and raises her daughter herself in near poverty flash forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous loving young lady dr dallas is not out of the picture still maintaining a <UNK> but caring relationship with his daughter <UNK> i'm rambling and worse yet making the movie sound somewhat interesting the acting and <UNK> are so over the top you'll let out a <UNK> in almost every scene the chief <UNK> is bette midler but close behind is john goodman as her alcoholic buddy each scene seems more contrived than the <UNK> right up to the finale which is truly a hoot taken as a dramatic piece this film rates no more than grade d but as camp it scores an <UNK> b br br
<START> this movie is not schlock despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions a dark fable for adults exploitation is a theme of sugar <UNK> and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme a weird movie with <UNK> visuals shadows and contrast are prominent definitely worth a look especially from fans of <UNK> and stylish <UNK> through all the cruelty and <UNK> a moral albeit twisted can be <UNK>
<START> i am not a big fan of <UNK> in the first place but <UNK> was a huge disappointment in between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre the storyline becomes very preachy instead of running for office like <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> almost appeared to be running as <UNK> <UNK> next big guru my wife tells me that since this film came out <UNK> <UNK> off doing any more movies br br we were lucky initially to have bought <UNK> an <UNK> by <UNK> online by accident when trying to buy this one that was a great film which made up for having bought this dud except it makes <UNK> look even worse by comparison br br bryan
<START> wow i can't believe i waited so long to see this film i just never got around to watching it the plot has nothing that interests me i know nothing about soccer football i am one of those american fools that has no clue i had never even seen david beckham before this film i chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in america enough about me br br truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movie making heaven what a fun film it's full of color and <UNK> i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie <UNK> <UNK> is so sweet and lovable you can't help but root for her no wonder why the american television show e r has <UNK> her up i have a new appreciation for indian culture those people know how to have a good time the wedding scenes are <UNK> beautiful br br the only problem i had was <UNK> some of the british <UNK> and dialogue through the accents i turned on the english subtitles to make sure i didn't miss anything this is not a criticism of the film i'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing <UNK> in american films as well br br this is a perfect date film it has a great sports plot like rocky and a strong sense of <UNK> that is <UNK> for women i watched it with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all loved it i highly recommend it
<START> a 1957 yes that's the correct date j arthur rank production with james robertson justice margaret <UNK> <UNK> hyde white it has to be a smash comedy right oh it's just awful it's a one gag film watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator music is thrown in most <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> carson is a lively dancer and competent singer but what was she doing in this film diana <UNK> is here too providing oh so daring shots for use in the previews her acting level is not bad but she's in the film to provide someone to <UNK> at well one must do something beside <UNK> during this film the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on e bay spare yourself the expense and the waste of time a comedy without a laugh a musical without a memorable song or dance
<START> this is the ultimate one man show in which eddie murphy is at his very best just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen this is the real eddie murphy his <UNK> of mr t pretending he is gay michael jackson and other artists are killers i think it's also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time my favorite act is the one where he is at his <UNK> <UNK> with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the stairs br br this show is the best medicine when you feel down if you watch the sequel <UNK> don't be disappointed it's quite good too but doesn't match <UNK>
<START> an <UNK> nightmare is the story of a man's <UNK> into insanity having <UNK> insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't br br we find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending wrong this is new york city the place where nobody sleeps br br tess <UNK> writer and director has herself a good film in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a talented filmmaker and writer she made this film right after her high school <UNK> she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future br br as i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable between the music bleak scenery and realistic portrayal of an <UNK> by dominic <UNK> as jack i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it
<START> carla works for a property <UNK> where she excels in being unattractive <UNK> and desperate she is also deaf br br her boss offers to hire in somebody to <UNK> her heavy <UNK> so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company help arrives in the form of paul a <UNK> <UNK> fresh out of prison and clearly <UNK> to the mannered routine of an office environment br br an <UNK> sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his <UNK> to embrace the working week when carla is edged out of an important contract she was <UNK> by a slimy colleague she exploits paul's <UNK> by having him steal the contract back the colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery but when he confronts her paul's <UNK> to punch people in the face comes in handy too but this <UNK> comes at a price br br paul is given a <UNK> <UNK> by some mob <UNK> as a reminder about an <UNK> debt he <UNK> a plan which <UNK> <UNK> unique lip reading abilities to rip off a gang of violent bank robbers it's now <UNK> turn to enter a frightening new world br br the fourth feature from director jacques <UNK> <UNK> my <UNK> begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two <UNK> losers only to shift <UNK> halfway through into an edgy thriller where their <UNK> shortcomings turn them into winners the leads are excellent effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect <UNK> first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> manners only to discover that he was until very recently a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who plays carla has that almost <UNK> ability to go from <UNK> to gorgeous and back again within a frame vincent <UNK> plays paul as a <UNK> dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or <UNK> the rip off that is likely to get him killed br br like many french films <UNK> my <UNK> appears at first to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul's <UNK> officer a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> br br it was the french <UNK> <UNK> of the 60's that first introduced the concept of <UNK> to film making and i've always felt that any medium is somewhat <UNK> when you have to use a system of <UNK> to help define it so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to <UNK> genre or better still defy it
<START> amazing documentary saw it on original <UNK> and on dvd a few times in the last few years i was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a best documentary oscar for 2002 the year it was released no other documentary even comes close br br it was on tv recently for the <UNK> <UNK> but i missed the added where are they now segment at the end except i did catch that tony now works for the <UNK> unit br br i've seen criticism on documentary film making from a few on this list i can't see how this could have been done any different they had less than 6 months to <UNK> this and get it on the air the dvd contains more material and background br br i'm also surprised that according to imdb com the brother have had no projects in the four years since what have they been doing
<START> i rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it was br br now i am pretty conservative in my views but i knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it i figured before the movie started michael douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a <UNK> conservative <UNK> as his antagonist but i thought thats where the political statement would begin and end br br ok the plot was solid single president falls for a <UNK> ok this has potential i thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique but then the movie turned into a liberal <UNK> the movie became more about gun control and <UNK> issues than it did about the relationship between the president and sydney <UNK> <UNK> br br there were several ridiculous premises in this movie 1 the character sydney playing this six figure <UNK> who is a closer could she have been more <UNK> she was constantly <UNK> and seemed in awe of everything hardly a closer i am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of <UNK> br br 2 secondly is there anything more ridiculous than richard dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic this is the most liberal man in hollywood and her is playing some right wing <UNK> give me a break i liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible br br 3 the speech at the end was simply ludicrous the line about i am a proud card carrying member of the <UNK> was a joke first no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra <UNK> group second why even bring something like that up you just <UNK> off over half the movie going audience who is <UNK> or conservative br br i thought the plot was great and unique i thought michael douglas was a good choice as president but the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failed br br its a shame to see a great plot ruined by hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
<START> well wayne's world is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off shoot movies from such cinematic <UNK> as it's pat to the recent 80 minute yawn a night at the <UNK> many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because tim meadows comes through in <UNK> the well written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon <UNK> character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor <UNK> largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory its a just great time if you don't feel like taking yourself too seriously <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of saved by the bell fame makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible finally billy dee williams <UNK> his <UNK> 45 days gives the movie a touch of class and for those out there who are mindless movie <UNK> like myself you will find this movie to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's a lady
<START> did i miss something here this adaptation has everything that <UNK> first novel had everything apart from the story the laughs the black humour the political intrigue the <UNK> the plot and some semblance of sense br br spoilers br br <UNK> from beginning to end they made a mockery of the plot they had a romance between <UNK> and a cop and what was that all about dr slaughter was portrayed as a <UNK> and who the hell was <UNK> crosby supposed to be br br it looked like they had made a three hour adaptation then chopped it down to 90 minutes even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever please please do not do this to any other of <UNK> books especially country of the blind
<START> i went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when i got in the room there was only me and my girlfriend this <UNK> to me that this film is not very good br br not to my surprise the film was dire ben affleck plays a guy who buys a family for christmas it is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him his acting is <UNK> but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good the plot line is poor and the comedy almost non existent br br however there are some good points for example the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny br br i hope this review stops other people wasting their money i was very embarrassed when i came out of the room
<START> no other movie has made me feel like this before and i don't feel bad like i don't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie 9 months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this the reason i say is because no matter how hard i <UNK> my brain i just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a <UNK> no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted <UNK> milk and <UNK> this much thank you ed br br uh <UNK> throat no words no thoughts i don't know i truly don't know <UNK>
<START> this is a <UNK> <UNK> vulgar silly all star <UNK> <UNK> of all the early <UNK> stars that warner bros could afford and like most other rarely seen films actually made during the late <UNK> an unforgettable opportunity to see and hear the genuine roaring <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> put to song and dance the show of shows is pretty gigantic vaudeville act after <UNK> after tap dance after <UNK> after comedian after fan dance after <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> tin tin who introduces <UNK> oriental <UNK> and on and on it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> away in fabulous <UNK> quality <UNK> sound it is far too long but among it's delirious <UNK> are the awesome <UNK> in the <UNK> number created on a scale of which the <UNK> <UNK> would be proud <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by a grand piano with some happiness boys <UNK> <UNK> a witty <UNK> nick lucas and the never ending grand finale in two color color which is all set to the song lady luck so keen are the <UNK> chorus line and <UNK> teenagers to en <UNK> <UNK> us that they almost kick themselves repeatedly in their own faces with glee and effort row after row of doll characters hop past and some even emerge from the floor i kid you not there are even girls <UNK> to the crystal <UNK> <UNK> with shiny <UNK> and <UNK> up with pearl <UNK> unable to move for days i imagine during production whilst this <UNK> of toy box <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> below to the <UNK> orchestra of course i loved it and had to watch this color finale over and over and then invite friends and family to the screen for weeks on end just to <UNK> and <UNK> them each <UNK> and to roll about on the <UNK> in <UNK> in delight at each and every <UNK> of their <UNK> reactions and so should you and <UNK> that there was an era when this was created simply to entertain and thrill it is all so demented
<START> this movie is one i strongly recommend it's about a boy stanley <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake a <UNK> <UNK> center there he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in <UNK> while there he meets the other boys of the camp zero <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> x ray and <UNK> all of them are digging not to <UNK> <UNK> but to find outlaw kate <UNK> treasure throughout the movie and book stanley learns more about the past more about himself and more about digging holes i give this movie a 9 5 because i am very <UNK> when it comes to books to movies i want the movie to follow the book exactly but still it did real well
<START> because others have gone to the trouble of <UNK> the plot i'd like to mention a few points about this film there may be spoilers here i don't care enough to <UNK> them out br br given the film's low budget the creature design was quite good it's actually nice to see a direct to video horror film that's not <UNK> with awful cgi unfortunately the digital film <UNK> quite grainy in places and it's most noticeable in the well lit white <UNK> of the asylum br br ridiculous lighting design <UNK> parts of this film to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time i understand the director might have been trying to <UNK> <UNK> but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established as is it merely seems amateurish br br plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable i neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the <UNK> <UNK> nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil <UNK> good development would surface at the end br br this may seem like <UNK> but characters in this film <UNK> fail to employ any kind of common sense first of all <UNK> <UNK> would be all over a mental health center that <UNK> <UNK> all patient and employee deaths <UNK> arrest induced why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing <UNK> why wasn't a plot point made of these impressive <UNK> or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion what's the background what's supposed to make us care about anyone in this and just as importantly who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place see everything that was so <UNK> wrong with it and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a <UNK> this film didn't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt br br bottom line see the wicker man instead
<START> bend it like beckham reminds me of the best of those 80's <UNK> <UNK> movies directed by john hughes everything takes place in a bubble <UNK> colored world where everyone is attractive there are some easily resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings and vast amounts of plot are <UNK> by montages set to <UNK> pop tunes nothing wrong with this however bend it like beckham is an absolute treat from beginning to end my wife and i found ourselves totally won over by the <UNK> cheesiness even as we were making fun of it and at the end as embarrassing as this is to admit we <UNK> and we saw this by the way in our living room not in a theatre watch this movie and enjoy br br grade b
<START> i'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic the little girl was a brat their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked besides it wasn't even a <UNK> as the film would like us to believe if you check out any complete guide to <UNK> you will find that it really is a crocodile not a <UNK> obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc it is a sad excuse for a movie especially the ending i nearly fell asleep with this one
<START> this clever film was originally a japanese film and while i assume that original film was pretty bad it was made a good bit worse when american international films <UNK> the film to pieces and inserted american made segments to fool the audience now unless your audience is made of total idiots it becomes painfully obvious that this was done and done with little <UNK> or care about the final product the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different plus the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at <UNK> just talking about gamera the evil flying turtle and although this is a fire breathing flying and destructive monster there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film in particular film veterans brian <UNK> and albert <UNK> they both just looked tired and ill at ease for being there br br now as for the monster it's not quite the standard godzilla like creature seeing a giant <UNK> turtle <UNK> his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious on the other hand the crappy model planes <UNK> <UNK> buildings and power plant are as usual in this film and come as no surprise plus an odd japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non japanese audience members and that is the adorable and <UNK> little boy who loves the monster and believes in him yeah right well just like in godzilla versus the <UNK> monster and several other films you've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster though unlike later <UNK> of godzilla gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot silly exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year old bad acting meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film oddly while most will surely hate this film and that stupid kid there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa don't believe them this is a terrible film br br <UNK> apparently due to his terrific stage presence gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent <UNK> none of these change the central fact that he is a fire breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really really lame
<START> first of all i need to say that i'm portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies probably one each year or even none br br and the reason is the almost <UNK> idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful really close to the worst ever made however in the last decade it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when <UNK> da <UNK> e <UNK> do <UNK> were among the worlds best of their time with movies like <UNK> zero or <UNK> <UNK> both from director <UNK> <UNK> and also with some actors and music in common br br this one is also good not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy in fact it's officially a drama a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them like the <UNK> travel to the <UNK> just to get laid br br the plot works and can surprise us a few times the actors are fine the locations regular as the score but the truth is that it all make sense then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema that seems to be starting from the <UNK> as the phoenix br br if you want to watch a portuguese movie surely you can take better option but it stills one to be <UNK>
<START> back to the roots with like it is in heaven what are the real values of life these <UNK> <UNK> out a message that appeals to every heart we've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat love pure and joy within the music of a choir that's simple yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone br br from the <UNK> of fame to the school of of his youth now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after <UNK> on stage daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple warm and rough people of the north br br he wins the hearts with music and <UNK> the capacity to love and be loved <UNK> br br don't go see it if you've been <UNK> to hollywood this stuff contains no extras just your laughter your compassion your tears
<START> a good cast with one major exception pushes its way through <UNK> smart light satire <UNK> was never better or funnier than she is here paired with <UNK> who's a veteran who's determined to become a <UNK> to get out of the war he and his buddies including suave con artist grant head to san francisco on leave and start the city's <UNK> party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking <UNK> the only thing about this movie that's not delightful is <UNK> <UNK> one note performance as <UNK> love interest which takes up too much of the film's time and slows down the pace in the second half <UNK> and <UNK> have good chemistry the gimmick is that she's set on making love to every <UNK> to do her duty for the war effort of course but he's a married man who nonetheless loves his wife they steal the movie with little trouble from grant who's amusing here in the first part of the film when not paired with his non actor co star
<START> the inspiring story of carl brashear cuba gooding jr a black man who grew up in poverty in kentucky and then joined the us navy aspiring to be the first black master diver in navy history we are shown the series of struggles from <UNK> on that brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true and then to keep it alive not the least of the challenges was master diver bill sunday robert deniro the head <UNK> at the diving school the navy sends brashear to who is not especially sympathetic to <UNK> goals but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and <UNK> br br this is a good movie fast paced and with a lot of action although not an action <UNK> in the normal sense of the word there's a very human story here as well and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it there's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960's between older and younger naval officers the old navy vs the new navy the performances are quite good particularly <UNK> i thought deniro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of sunday although who knows sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon and the portrayal of <UNK> wife <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> also made me question whether these parts were <UNK> up to provide entertainment value br br a good movie though i never once wondered if it was worth <UNK> into br br 7 10
<START> was it <UNK> when <UNK> complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot and then her new boyfriend the murderer turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence i think so scenes to make you <UNK> with delight montages <UNK> a strip <UNK> in a <UNK> what do you call it when you <UNK> put clothes on instead of take them off and a climactic battle on <UNK> definitely tune in for the beginning and end but you can grab a <UNK> during the second act when all the plot is happening is it better than co ed call girl <UNK> does <UNK> ever make it to paradise or out of the snow even nope
<START> finally after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of basic instinct we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this i remember everything about the original the steam the romance the sex the <UNK> the music by the master jerry <UNK> and everything else from violence and murder to intense <UNK> of all kind make no mistake basic instinct was a real winner for audiences everywhere i can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel five years later we have it i never would have thought it to end up such as this when it was <UNK> a dropped project time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with well i guess we now know <UNK> possible in this case even if the original director or writer are not present all we need is the glamorous always reliable sharon stone and we have a done deal please hear me out br br when people say that this film is bad i think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme and slightly dated i use the word dated only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years and audiences have become adapted to the pointless boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly who needs hole some and clean of course it's a pleasant thing to have but c'mon <UNK> is really seldom these days and basic instinct 2 gives us real fans what we've been expecting this film is not an academy award winner nor does it try to be it simply delivers the die hard fans what they have been expecting it's a film for fun movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously but this film is just loose and fun not taking itself seriously not too seriously anyway that said i shall <UNK> the film br br the film is a fast paced film from the first second as we see <UNK> <UNK> in a car <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> and enjoying <UNK> thrills doing so perhaps sex and driving does not mix because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and well she gets away <UNK> but her <UNK> partner doesn't fare too well once again <UNK> is the primary suspect of the accident and will be put under <UNK> and <UNK> dr michael glass <UNK> is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her like another criminal investigator before him he is <UNK> and <UNK> slowly and surely his denial of it all begins to <UNK> around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do <UNK> is possibly more dangerous now than she was before but like the first one we'll never really know will we once the seduction is in motion jealousy rage drugs and a <UNK> of erotic scenery ensues br br this film does not <UNK> the first one but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time this is a good thing it lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two sharon stone <UNK> us again as though 14 years has not come to pass her second run of the <UNK> novelist is right on the spot as earlier just awesome david <UNK> is well cast and manages pretty well the fact that a non popular star was chosen makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him just what we see him perform my final thought 8 5 to 9 out of 10 so it's not the first one nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place it can however live up to the standards set by the first film and it does folks it does
<START> maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the <UNK> and it's such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than i've been for a while br br it is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the <UNK> history of prince <UNK> and the aftermath the way <UNK> in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled that's much of what makes it so good it's an elaborate special effects laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small things br br i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
<START> truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen ever br br they tried to make up for it by giving it the <UNK> know we are doing <UNK> routine that would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'the <UNK> had already done it and it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place br br the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's mainly j <UNK> fantasies the flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred just <UNK> of say j d falling over or i don't know elliott falling over if i wanted to watch a <UNK> <UNK> i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life br br <UNK> has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit <UNK> have to and it disappoints me they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this br br i was hoping that <UNK> wouldn't have to be that kind of sit com br br and just as a passing thought why the hell was dr cox bald
<START> even worse than the worst david lynch <UNK> brain dead makes no sense whatsoever <UNK> wasted talent bill <UNK> bill paxton <UNK> around like they are in a tom and jerry cartoon on acid there is <UNK> character development it simply starts climbing the strange scale until <UNK> in total chaos do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors they are given nothing to work with and you will be wondering what's going on throughout the entire unbearable 85 minutes i highly recommend avoiding brain dead at all costs unless you are into <UNK> your brain into total nonsense <UNK>
<START> i'm a big fan of fan of film noir and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best that i've seen preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit <UNK> gene tierney and dana andrews for an entirely different sort of crime film laura was based around love and this film is based around hate as we watch police detective mark dixon a <UNK> already suffering <UNK> from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal a man by the name of tommy <UNK> the plot is brilliantly worked and preminger excellently <UNK> several plot points but it all comes back down to the main moral <UNK> surrounding our main character the fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from and director otto preminger expertly captures the <UNK> side of life by showing the main characters gambling beating one another and their women shooting and more and this also helps to <UNK> the film from the earlier <UNK> which was very much set in upper class society br br the role of mark dixon gives dana andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career here we have a character that is difficult to like as he's so cold but the fact that we can understand his motives <UNK> that he's easy to <UNK> with and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight the character development is well timed and as we've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film everything makes sense by the end his co star is the beautiful gene tierney who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in laura a film that made tierney its <UNK> she does well with what she's got however and the lead <UNK> chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she's in i can't say that this is a better film than the earlier laura that's a hard act to follow but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than <UNK> earlier film the film also makes a good comparison piece for laura as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie yet it's all strangely familiar highly recommended to all
<START> where was this film when i was a kid after his parents split up <UNK> moves with his mom to live his his grandfather <UNK> sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone grandfather is only here every third day <UNK> never really home the kids always are picking on the poor kid during a village festival <UNK> is chosen the <UNK> rider or spiritual champion of the peace and justice little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things <UNK> in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world br br okay that was the easy part now comes the hard part trying to explain the film br br this is a great kids film no this is a great film flawed very flawed but a great film none the less it unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as <UNK> struggles to find the strength to become a hero watching it i felt i was reading a great book and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book i loved that the film does not follow a normal path things often happen out of <UNK> or through <UNK> one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep there are twists and turns and moments that seem like non <UNK> and are all the more charming for it which is typical miike certainly its a takashi miike film that japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching scary and funny all at the same time no one except miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next i admire the fact that miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful that doesn't shy away from being scary i mean really scary especially for kids this is the same dark territory that should be in the harry potter movies but rarely is this a dark <UNK> tale with humor my first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that i couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world then i realized who was making the movie hats off to miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images br br its also operating on more than one level the mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> junk its the rage of being thrown away that <UNK> the monsters one of the yokai spirits talks about the rage <UNK> thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed you also have one of the good guys <UNK> to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do its a wild concept but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level there are a good many <UNK> and references to other movies tv shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them though many parents will and of course there are the monsters they run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between frankly you have to forgive the <UNK> of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen its way cool and it works one of the main characters is a yokai which i think is best described as a <UNK> in a <UNK> and is often played by a stuffed animal it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little <UNK> and loving every moment he rides on <UNK> head acceptance is also easier if you've ever seen the old <UNK> of the weird japanese monsters i mentioned flaws and there are a few the effects are uneven some of the sudden turns are a bit odd even if understandable and a few other minor things which are <UNK> now some two hours after watching the film none of them truly hurt the film over all however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie br br i really loved this movie i'm pretty sure that if i saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time where's the english dub see this movie its a great trip besides its a good introduction to the films of miike minus the blood and graphic sex
<START> this is an awesome classic monster flick from the 50's i just love the look of the 50's in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the blob looks i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween ii br br when steve and jane are making out they see a meteor fall from space inside the meteor is the blob whenever the blob <UNK> a person it grows bigger and bigger they try to convince the people of the town about the <UNK> monster but no one believes them until later can anything stop this <UNK> creature i highly recommend the blob
<START> there's nothing amazing about 'the amazing mr <UNK> part of this movie's problem is its lead actor melvyn douglas he was a lousy actor and lazy with it for most of his career he allowed his good looks a <UNK> manner and usually but not in this movie some fine <UNK> to make up for his lack of acting ability i disliked douglas as an actor before i knew anything about him as a person i've <UNK> enough about him to know that i also despise his politics i'll give melvyn douglas credit for one thing his <UNK> did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress <UNK> douglas br br melvyn douglas made this movie right after the brilliant <UNK> talk about a <UNK> 'the amazing mr <UNK> is allegedly a comedy but i never laughed douglas plays a <UNK> detective on the homicide squad named kenny williams i never heard of a police detective named kenny but if they called him kenneth williams well what a carry on the whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about killing women no motive is given for this he just likes to kill women the mayor jonathan hale better than usual calls williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer br br spoilers approaching the cheap vulgar <UNK> and unattractive joan blondell plays the <UNK> secretary she doesn't sound <UNK> enough to file a letter much less type one blondell and douglas <UNK> like a cat and a dog so it's blatantly obvious they're going to end up together br br at this movie's lowest point melvyn douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman you do not want to see melvyn douglas in drag he's well over six foot and he doesn't even <UNK> off that annoying <UNK> the similarly <UNK> william powell was an actor very similar in type to melvyn douglas but much more talented when powell disguised himself as a woman in <UNK> <UNK> he had the integrity to <UNK> off his <UNK> a genuine sacrifice as powell needed it to grow in again for his next role but melvyn douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie not even a razor he plays his drag scenes with the same annoying <UNK> he used throughout the bulk of his career br br on the plus side 'the amazing mr <UNK> has several of those splendid supporting players who made hollywood's movies of the <UNK> so delightful edward <UNK> is brilliant here touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely <UNK> from his life sentence the <UNK> donald <UNK> is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer and is nearly <UNK> by a mob ruth <UNK> is splendid as usual for her but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual <UNK> on the warner brothers <UNK> jimmy <UNK> luis <UNK> and the <UNK> dave <UNK> are all fine in small roles barbara pepper whom i usually dislike is good here too the grossly unpleasant <UNK> <UNK> gets some screen time i always <UNK> her and she gives the same performance in every film but some audiences enjoy <UNK> one note performance very much for reasons i can't <UNK> br br if you're familiar with hollywood character actors of the 1930s and the roles they tended to play one glance at <UNK> cast list will tell you who the murderer is that's the problem with 'the amazing mr <UNK> everything is too obvious i'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10
<START> might contain spoilers but believe me this movie <UNK> itself from start to finish br br i walked into this movie with high expectations it was my own fault i had put too much stock in steve <UNK> record to date 40 year old virgin little miss sunshine the office and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7 5 user rating before going to the movie it's always been a very good <UNK> in the past but something is definitely off lately the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching blue steel in 1990 br br this flick <UNK> from start to finish the script was <UNK> material awful writing all around murderer of love love is an ability whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same <UNK> that struck american <UNK> writer s trying <UNK> too hard the entire flick was <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> moments like the awful and contrived shower scene or the pointless confusing <UNK> scene or the awful <UNK> room scene right when you think something serious and or real is about to happen they toss in one of these terrible moments and it happens over and over and over again br br and what's with <UNK> character the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love let's face it their conversation sucked they both should have said their <UNK> after a few minutes pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie <UNK> character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un funny i think the exact line was this one time when i was a kid that's it seriously but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to <UNK> out of their <UNK> the actors themselves looked like they were in pain wondering why they're being directed to do what they're doing br br back to the imdb thing you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's <UNK> team off this site i know it's impossible but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings reviews were either posted by 12 year olds or by <UNK> hired by the studio check out the family <UNK> rating if that's a mid 5 then this absolutely has got to be a 2 and that's pushing it
<START> samuel <UNK> pickup on south street is <UNK> a red scare movie devoid of <UNK> in which the communist threat is nothing more than the <UNK> that <UNK> the plot <UNK> richard widmark <UNK> loose woman jean peters of her <UNK> containing a strip of <UNK> <UNK> to either of them it <UNK> secrets vital to the cold war peters as it happens was under <UNK> by fbi agents who are as <UNK> by the <UNK> as the man who's running her cowardly <UNK> richard <UNK> in trying to retrieve the precious film both sides <UNK> the help of thelma ritter a <UNK> old jane who's always on the <UNK> and willing to sell what she hears br br fuller draws from an <UNK> palette of <UNK> and <UNK> in telling the story which becomes a race against the clock of <UNK> brutality from the <UNK> to the <UNK> his <UNK> manhattan takes on a <UNK> sheen that's almost <UNK> the love scenes between peters and widmark become an unstable mixture of the <UNK> and the tender and they're scored to again a song introduced by <UNK> <UNK> in road house also starring widmark the pace <UNK> for <UNK> beautifully written and played death scene among the most poignant vignettes in all noir and a kind of <UNK> <UNK> in a film <UNK> of sentimentality this is writer director <UNK> only work in the <UNK> confines of the noir cycle his later <UNK> of american <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the naked kiss underworld u s a never resulted in a <UNK> as satisfying as pickup on south street
<START> this movie <UNK> me cry at the end i watch at least 3 4 movies a week i seen loads of great movies even more crap ones but when ending scene <UNK> at it's core came i cried and if you didn't you have serious problems the story is <UNK> nothing new or original but it's real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist <UNK> isn't my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70's at some point this directed me toward <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> never really work very good but this movie really <UNK> us believe it all because they don't try to make it as a path full of glorious <UNK> present musicians that are <UNK> <UNK> girls that are stupid and emotionally <UNK> they don't <UNK> drugs and alcohol they promote <UNK> and redemption that comes even 20 years late once again great movie since leaving las vegas i was never so moved by a movie
<START> this movie is truly awful after seeing the <UNK> for it i thought it could have its charms but it didn't the girls cannot act and they cannot sing either the soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs and its not a pretty sight terrible story line unbelievable plot its one of disney's worst movies by far ally is not a bad actress on phil of the future so i don't know what happened in cow <UNK> and her sister <UNK> seems to be just <UNK> a ride on her sisters fame and she displays no talent what so ever br br at the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some cliché morals but this is to late to rescue this train wreck movie br br awful
<START> designed only to annoy or <UNK> any self <UNK> intelligent person if the director's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of america's pro <UNK> 60s movement especially not a filmmaker from the 70s there is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that's how <UNK> the movie appears <UNK> has been in her share of <UNK> movies which brings me to the obvious <UNK> conclusion that the <UNK> <UNK> is one of those hollywood liberal morons but i mean aren't they all nice boobs but s t for brains
<START> from actor and independent writer director john cassavetes a woman under the influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental <UNK> the husband nick played by peter falk is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife mabel played by gena rowlands the amount of attention that she deserves from the <UNK> of the film it is obvious that mabel is very quirky and strange but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that crazy <UNK> out of her damn mind nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co workers and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner he asks her if she'll be okay as if he's trying to deny <UNK> illness her problem only <UNK> from there br br i did find some particular problems with this film i guess these problems were mostly present in the story and the way some of the character acted toward the end mabel has been committed because frankly she's nuts then six months later she's ready to come out of the hospital and her husband throws a party to welcome her back he never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie why would he invite all these people some of them strangers to mabel over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state it's simply idiotic later after mabel comes in the house <UNK> father has a huge <UNK> at nick screaming at the top of his <UNK> about not wanting to eat spaghetti his daughter has just gotten back from six months of <UNK> and the thing you want to do is keep her calm and he goes nuts over spaghetti a few minutes later in the film nick brings mabel into the <UNK> and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable make her weird noises and gestures didn't he send her there to make her better and not do those things there were various other parts that occurred after this but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail i guess i just had a serious problem with the decision by cassavetes to have his characters act in this way it simply didn't make sense br br however although i had problems with the ending of the film there was one aspect that really redeemed it the acting gena rowlands played an amazing crazy woman there were times when i forgot she was acting where i got so caught up in her wild <UNK> and crazy talk that i was actually scared of her she was amazingly convincing and intense however i was also impressed by the rest of <UNK> family peter falk played a very strange character and i almost thought he was crazy himself because of the awkward way he handled his children his job and especially the situation with his wife i also usually don't appreciate child actors but the young people who played nick and <UNK> children in this film were phenomenal it really felt like they were <UNK> children because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem i think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense br br in general i wasn't impressed by this film the story was <UNK> and unclear and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasn't insane in the movie the only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the <UNK> family their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together and are probably the only reason the film has ever <UNK> to anything
<START> will and ted's <UNK> journey is an existential trip through themes of <UNK> religion time heaven and hell man's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art <UNK> iron maiden <UNK> shakespeare this time the <UNK> are a famous rock band having <UNK> through time collecting icons from the past <UNK> joan of <UNK> <UNK> wife oscar <UNK> and charles <UNK> they took the skills they learned from each of these people <UNK> a couple of <UNK> and finally learned to play their <UNK> and write hit songs these songs teach the world to love again and war <UNK> evil are <UNK> for eternity we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who <UNK> good music called simon cow al wants to rule the world he eats <UNK> the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin and <UNK> the power to send two <UNK> back in time the <UNK> are living <UNK> over metal <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel and they can imitate anything they <UNK> by physical contact it is their job to kill the good <UNK> and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no one could like by doing this they will change the world forever <UNK> and <UNK> music will never be made leaving a world of war <UNK> and hatred and more annoyingly bland boy girl group pop music there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world themselves and their wives from the evil <UNK> <UNK> their bodies br br penelope <UNK> shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references and seeks to teach us all something by <UNK> into our very psyche to show us ourselves she presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and <UNK> us to <UNK> the post <UNK> <UNK> self love and <UNK> of the time <UNK> us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message but in order to achieve such dreams we must <UNK> and indeed face our nightmares to overcome is to succeed to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving in the words of kenneth reeves <UNK> ' best scene for a fun game see how many songs bands and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film there are at least 6
<START> everything was better in past days even children's television and <UNK> rock proves my point quite easily at the time of writing this comment i am <UNK> years old but even in my teen years i can't resist the charm of <UNK> rock for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock haha <UNK> rock is about a <UNK> of playful and goofy creatures called <UNK> who live amazingly in a rock but they're not the only creatures the rock is inhabited with many other species like the <UNK> <UNK> and countless living plants outside the rock on one side live <UNK> scientist doc and his dog <UNK> who later befriends <UNK> <UNK> on the other side a family of <UNK> supposed <UNK> of the universe the five main <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> leader <UNK> arty and peaceful <UNK> <UNK> and a friend to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> domestic god and red loves anything to do with sport and general <UNK> get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away br br <UNK> rock is definitely a family show the plots may have intricate details that <UNK> may not follow well but the song and dance routines will hold their attention the characters are strong and likable their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling the <UNK> are frightening doc and <UNK> <UNK> uncle travelling matt hilarious the <UNK> segments are very 80s and the final episode change of address genuinely touching let's go down to <UNK> rock again
<START> it was very heart warming as an <UNK> french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a <UNK> distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed so br br strong and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this <UNK> relationship between the <UNK> son leo who has <UNK> hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two characters br br <UNK> explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs
<START> <UNK> <UNK> claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old if not older than shakespeare br br <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to <UNK> his life he has a problem 5 sisters and a <UNK> mum the <UNK> who decide he should be married enter the delightful charming charlotte <UNK> and what should be a simple plan charlotte has to pose as <UNK> girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding no more talk of marriage from the <UNK> of course the best laid plans have a habit of <UNK> out of control br br there are very strong supporting roles from <UNK> as the mother and <UNK> as the tight <UNK> brother of <UNK> br br there are some fantastic scenes as first charlotte has to charm then revolt the family french farce with an english
<START> i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie it's stupid ridiculous and just not funny at all br br since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad br br what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one <UNK> little men scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts br br just skip this piece of garbage br br p s sorry for my english
<START> okay i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst but it's not <UNK> you seen freddy's revenge wtf that was the worst of all now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc etc br br and then i found out it was in 3 d i was so excited i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly <UNK> to the 3 d sequences quite a lot was in 3 d though like lisa <UNK> hand dream demons freddy's claw more than once <UNK> dean holding a knife lisa zane with a baseball bat <UNK> hand freddy's head exploding br br i truly loved this movie because it was in 3 d but i wish the whole movie was in 3 d not just the last 15 minutes br br by the way it's 15 minutes not ten
<START> this film is a huge steaming pile br br i have no idea why anyone felt that the garland mason version needed to be <UNK> nor why <UNK> would have been a first choice to star br br for that matter i have no idea why our people gay americans tend largely to regard <UNK> as some kind of treasure at least in my opinion she had <UNK> <UNK> with with funny girl and <UNK> what's up doc br br do yourself a favor and rent the judy classic or even the original a fine film in its own right but please please please skip this <UNK>
<START> roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time as the mind behind classics such as rosemary's baby and <UNK> probably what makes <UNK> cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating <UNK> attractive films such as the <UNK> mentioned masterpieces he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature le <UNK> or the tenant is one of those movies a horror suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done br br polanski himself plays <UNK> a young man looking for an apartment in france when he finally finds one he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant <UNK> <UNK> attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window after <UNK> dies of the <UNK> <UNK> begins to become obsessed with her to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the <UNK> in the building br br while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films <UNK> rosemary's baby this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in <UNK> head the <UNK> effects the paranoia has on his mind and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant br br <UNK> <UNK> into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski while at first his performance seems odd and wooden slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because <UNK> is meant to be acted that way as a <UNK> with almost no life who traps himself in this <UNK> sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film br br also the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for <UNK> the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive br br if a flaw is to be found in the film is that it is definitely a bit slow at first this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it <UNK> <UNK> own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm also the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has however more than a flaw it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one br br while the tenant may not be for everyone those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience le <UNK> is really one of roman <UNK> masterpieces 10 10
<START> i managed to sneak away one night and go to the movie theater to see this one thinking i was in for a treat boy was i wrong considering the talent involved this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen everyone in it was miscast and i find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there who actually liked it
<START> i don't care if you'd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn't good you're so obsessed by the films of hollywood that you can't see how good is this movie i'm not a fan of jay <UNK> but i like his play and not only his and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think it's not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than usa in the world and it's good really good and it cost a lot to do it so please don't criticize the actors the directors cause you don't know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you
<START> for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making winchester '73 has something in common with casablanca while you watch it you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of clichés encountered so often in the genre then you realise that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular film and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great in other words it's a <UNK> work br br winchester '73 is a joy to watch the broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable but mostly because you've seen them copied so many times in later movies and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you the dialogue the pacing and <UNK> direction are excellent stewart shines in particular and if you're a fan this is a must see but he is not alone in delivering a good performance remarkably many of the most thoughtful and or witty lines go to minor characters because this makes these characters much more than cardboard <UNK> it <UNK> additional realism to the film br br this is a remarkably underrated film and well worth keeping an eye out for the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film
<START> the best treasure island ever made they just don't make films br br like this anymore or ever no one makes films like this more br br than a novelty this film is funny frank and fascinating yet moody br br mysterious and <UNK> this is one of my favorite pictures the br br director must have had some idea what it is all about but he br br certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations while leaving little left to the imagination why he br br has not made more films like this i have no idea while br br reminding me of some of the best noir it is one of a kind but this br br is not for the lazy or simple
<START> ghost story the tv movie 1972 was the pilot for the nbc series the movie was well written and well acted and i thought when the 1972 73 tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner i wish this film was available on video the series was a <UNK> disappointment even with william castle as <UNK> producer if however you have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out you won't be disappointed
<START> this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film i am fan of the first two major <UNK> but this one is lame
<START> before i give spike lee's mess of a film summer of sam a well deserved <UNK> i would like to make one thing clear i do not <UNK> this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images what makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that lee seems to believe that summer of sam should be taken seriously as a socially <UNK> drama the crime caper films of quentin tarantino for example are filled with violence profanity and other sleaze but are nonetheless highly watchable because tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art he knows that such films are for entertainment value only on the other hand serious dramas such as saving private ryan and <UNK> list are often unpleasant to watch but the <UNK> serves to develop the film's plot and characters with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters <UNK> summer of sam unfortunately merely <UNK> in its own <UNK> and sleaze while believing that it is serving as social commentary much like other trash epics br br summer of sam does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard <UNK> stereotypes its plot <UNK> to show the emotional impact of the <UNK> over the son of sam murders on the residents of the <UNK> italian american north <UNK> neighborhood where the murders <UNK> however instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities lee simply <UNK> out every negative italian stereotype imaginable the men are ignorant lazy <UNK> <UNK> the women are split between weak <UNK> good girls mira <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> bad girls jennifer <UNK> ruby lee seems to <UNK> wants to <UNK> hollywood for their years of negative african american stereotyping by <UNK> out stereotypes of his own and few critics seem to care if martin scorsese for example presented residents of an african american neighborhood as a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> andy and aunt <UNK> stereotypes critics would rightfully <UNK> such blatant stereotyping more importantly one dimensional stereotypical characters <UNK> any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary br br without exception the cast of summer of sam is excellent however the acting for the most part is uninspired the cast is either just going through the motions or they have little to work with <UNK> additionally there is notable <UNK> comedian john <UNK> is very talented but his <UNK> character seems to be a stale comedic <UNK> of john <UNK> tony <UNK> from saturday night fever and michael <UNK> a <UNK> nice guy actor is badly miscast as serial killer david <UNK> coming across as funny rather than frightening the only performance worth paying attention to is <UNK> <UNK> as the troubled but sincere neighborhood <UNK> ritchie the <UNK> performance and the typically stylish lee cinematography are this film's only virtues br br 1 2 out of
<START> using tons of stock footage not only from <UNK> horn but also the first two films in the series for example the alligator fight was used last time out this is one of the weakest films in the mgm series its a huge let down after the classic tarzan and his mate which is possibly the best film in the series br br the plot has jane's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she'll come back to claim it they are kind of in the <UNK> since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will hiring a great white hunter who secretly wishes to capture tarzan and sell him the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles more so because of the stock footage after lots of talk jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of tarzan and <UNK> making <UNK> face finally into the last half hour the plot to capture tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned br br painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film the middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere the last third where tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re shoot the film to me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good except at the end i would be hard pressed to explain it except i would have to say that it was the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> as tarzan and jane which kept people coming back its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples br br i should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more <UNK> with the appearance of the tarzan tree house i really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy if you can come in towards the end i would recommend giving the film a try otherwise i would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series
<START> this is not really a zombie film if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around here the protagonist <UNK> <UNK> played by an unbelievably young dean jagger <UNK> control of a method to create zombies though in fact his <UNK> is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into <UNK> slaves this is an interesting concept for a movie and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of <UNK> <UNK> films including <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and 'the testament of dr <UNK> 1933 here it is unfortunately <UNK> to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancée claire duvall played by the anne <UNK> look alike with a bad <UNK> dorothy stone which is really the major theme br br the movie has an intriguing beginning as <UNK> is sent on a military <UNK> expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there at some type of compound where we get great 30s sets and clothes he <UNK> his engagement to claire and then barely five minutes later she gives him back his ring <UNK> her love for his pal <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact this would have been a great movie for <UNK> science theater <UNK> if they hadn't already <UNK> it br br it's never shown how <UNK> actually learns the <UNK> secret but he then uses it to kill his enemies create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards we won't see such sheer force of will until john <UNK> in 'the brain from planet <UNK> 1957 br br finally claire <UNK> to marry him if he will let <UNK> live and return to america <UNK> agrees but actually turns him into one of his <UNK> slaves on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his <UNK> ' to gain her love he does so causing the <UNK> of the title in which all his slaves <UNK> and attack his compound and kill him <UNK> <UNK> claire and we seem to be at the end of a <UNK> whom the gods would destroy they first make mad br br so really then it's not that bad of a film despite the low imdb rating it currently has on repeated viewings one can see the artistry in the well formed script dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor and is almost <UNK> in his <UNK> is that really his own hair we remember him more for his bald old man roles in <UNK> <UNK> 1954 <UNK> the <UNK> 1956 and <UNK> <UNK> 1958 the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the <UNK> brothers better earlier film <UNK> <UNK> 1932 in which hapless robert <UNK> as charles <UNK> uses <UNK> to win the love of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> parker br br if you want real zombie movies of which there are hundreds i'd start with <UNK> <UNK> 1932 <UNK> of the <UNK> 1941 'i walked with a <UNK> 1943 <UNK> of the living <UNK> 1968 'the last man on <UNK> 1964 and its two remakes in the modern era of classy films there are <UNK> <UNK> 1972 'the <UNK> and the <UNK> 1988 <UNK> days <UNK> 2002 and its sequel as well as many many others too numerous to mention br br this one is not really a zombie film judging this movie on its own terms it's more of a semi gothic romance as such it ranks a little below some of <UNK> bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s so i'll give it a 5
<START> when i was a kid i watched this many times over and i remember <UNK> the happy cat song quite often all the songs are great and actually memorable unlike many children's musicals where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason the scenes and costumes are lavish and the acting is very well done which isn't surprising considering the cast christopher walken is very <UNK> and doesn't need stupid make up or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he's a cat transformed to a human and jason <UNK> so cute as the shy and awkward <UNK> son <UNK> who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera this is a really fun enjoyable feature length movie where unlike most <UNK> the characters are given personalities some of my favourite parts are when <UNK> makes <UNK> pretend he's drowning at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance as it's all the rage abroad when walken is in the kitchen dancing on the table he's a pretty good dancer too and when vera tells <UNK> all the things she used to do when she was young like pretending she was a <UNK> daughter i'd recommend this film to children and parents alike who love magic and <UNK> and it actually is a movie you can watch together as it won't drive adults up the wall
<START> this is an unusual laurel hardy comedy with something of a split personality at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short happily each portion is funny in its own right and the <UNK> seemingly <UNK> <UNK> carries the day and <UNK> the film's <UNK> elements into an entertaining whole while i've never heard a fan <UNK> dirty work as his or her favorite laurel hardy comedy it's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like br br our story is set in the home of professor <UNK> who represents one key element of the story line a wildly over the top parody of mad scientist scenarios this marks a rare venture into sci fi territory for l h <UNK> <UNK> and the three stooges <UNK> with mad doctors far more often than stan ollie in any event the professor is obsessed with creating a <UNK> serum that can make people younger while his sarcastic butler <UNK> expresses the viewer's <UNK> with rolled eyes and the occasional dry <UNK> meanwhile stan ollie are <UNK> <UNK> who show up at the <UNK> home the very day he <UNK> his solution their portion of the film consists of characteristic but first rate slapstick involving the <UNK> the roof <UNK> and a number of unfortunate <UNK> if you don't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably won't like dirty work but for fans of the team this movie is a feast the highlight comes when ollie <UNK> through the <UNK> lands in the <UNK> and is then <UNK> with <UNK> that fall onto his head with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one by one i also like the shot of ollie <UNK> off the roof into a <UNK> the process work is so <UNK> i suspect it was something of an inside joke the way w c <UNK> movies would feature the world's worst rear projection screens br br the slapstick stuff is great fun but it's the mad scientist <UNK> that makes this film offbeat and two supporting players deserve a tip of the <UNK> hat prolific character actor <UNK> <UNK> is terrific as the professor delivering his <UNK> lines with <UNK> and <UNK> with hammy glee while sam adams is a <UNK> in the less <UNK> role of <UNK> the butler as great as stan laurel and oliver hardy were in their prime it's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the hal roach studio gave their films an enormous boost so too usually did the background music of le roy shield but dirty work marks a rare occasion from this period that a roach comedy has no musical <UNK> at all after the opening credits mood music might have enhanced the proceedings but no matter this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow and a prime example of what made laurel hardy so popular in their day
<START> this independent b w <UNK> feature consistently shocks <UNK> and <UNK> with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them it's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff yet as absurd as much of the film should be there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded keeps the entire piece from <UNK> into complete <UNK> and <UNK> lies the real message here this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad that seems to be the heart of the film for as insane and off the wall as things get leon the 30 <UNK> old <UNK> protagonist always tries to keep it together he's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best so that everyone can have what they want br br the acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive van <UNK> is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd <UNK> <UNK> just as the characters in the film do we overlook her sudden <UNK> to see the real person underneath br br <UNK> is a true genius here he takes the <UNK> ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing <UNK> it's a true testament to the skill of <UNK> and all involved that this film with it's grating plot and characters never once works our nerves <UNK> has taken a film that could have been <UNK> and <UNK> and somehow given it heart and humor this is a unique film not to be missed br br
<START> another great movie by <UNK> <UNK> it's a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in <UNK> and support of latin american <UNK> br br despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical <UNK> communist propaganda of the cold war era <UNK> <UNK> is a well known communist <UNK> and his movies are always biased for example he presents the us actions as brutal and <UNK> while representing <UNK> <UNK> activities as something positive br br as it turned out it was a <UNK> for <UNK> and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes i never heard of poor <UNK> or <UNK> girls <UNK> themselves en <UNK> as it happens in most east european countries the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america and elsewhere but sometimes you need to play dirty this is not an idealistic world as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> like to believe had <UNK> come to power in <UNK> we would've had another <UNK> in latin america br br all in all this movie follows corrupt and <UNK> <UNK> ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct
<START> i expected this film to be a run of the mill 1930's romance boy meets girl they fall in love boy loses girl boy wins her back in the end it wasn't like that at all clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous <UNK> raising he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby jean harlow 's apartment to find her covered in <UNK> in the <UNK> no less instant chemistry she plays hard to get for a while but a girl can only resist that grin for so long the heat between them is evident and there are some scenes that are definitely pre production code when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a <UNK> house for troubled girls she is miserable and thanks to the <UNK> her roommate gives her begins to believe that eddie will never come for her harlow plays the hard <UNK> fast talking ruby perfectly she never lets gable get all the good lines there is an especially moving scene with her playing their song on the piano that is acted perfectly the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time a truly sweet romance
<START> alright this was quite a sensitive little number but i can't help thinking i've seen it before reminds me of another <UNK> film i saw at <UNK> called the other days of ruby <UNK> also had <UNK> of welcome to the <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in it's execution which is not to say that they're not <UNK> references just that they feel very modern and very <UNK> which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising as an approach in style and story than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come br br the cinematography is just too perfect for my liking too <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> for my liking too <UNK> framed <UNK> therefore the entire impression left me a little distant beware of art that <UNK> itself too readily the french they are a conservative bunch seemed to buy it as did the jury however but cannes short film selection is <UNK> conservative compared to it's feature selection although i wonder what's been happening in the last few years
<START> the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up <UNK> he's being hunted by a female doctor turned vigilante who is out to <UNK> him this female assassin who looks like a <UNK> from a <UNK> <UNK> video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right <UNK> <UNK> in the middle of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which <UNK> along like a bad version of the island of dr <UNK> and yes it's worse than the one with val kilmer
<START> let me be the first non australian to comment on this i got the movie for hugo <UNK> and i watched it to the end it's one of those drama of life films as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly <UNK> br br i liked the light and the girls the rest was without too much fault but without too much merit either i <UNK> for something like the interview or at least some matrix villain element here and there but nothing out of the ordinary the story does teach one about facing one's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you but this happens when the life giving <UNK> factory in the area is about to close so not much of an effort to change things is required br br the smart american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film br br in the end i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life but to me it didn't seem specifically australian it could have been placed anywhere and it didn't seem attractive as a story br br i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie
<START> ever watched a movie that lost the plot well this didn't even really have one to begin with br br where to begin the <UNK> tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant <UNK> that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double <UNK> the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests a <UNK> of 20 killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never <UNK> far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction br br add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hope br br given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80's mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic <UNK> murder don't worry its <UNK> at least ten minutes before br br after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and <UNK> a large <UNK> what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and <UNK> in front of the murder weapon br br it really is only a movie as they say
<START> a <UNK> to <UNK> is a wonderful movie it's based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent <UNK> or family member in other words everyone br br though the production isn't quite hollywood quality no big special effects still the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the <UNK> that occurs when one of them becomes ill br br you don't want to miss this
<START> in the future of 2001 freddy is after the last surviving teenager of elm street <UNK> any scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos come on <UNK> tom arnold wtf this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got wow was this a piece of crap not even the great legendary alice cooper could make the <UNK> of this movie go away and when they hell did freddy ever have a daughter the whole film is severely retarded in ever single <UNK> way shape form rachel <UNK> you stink to high heaven babe br br my grade d br br dvd extras cast and crew <UNK> jump to the 3d sequence and jump to a nightmare <UNK> more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of the nightmare collection dvd set br br dvd <UNK> content trivia game screenplay and web link
<START> i saw this movie when i was little it was called <UNK> fox i was totally traumatized by it it follows a cute little fox family around the beginning was great and i remember becoming very attached to the little <UNK> i also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while i was in <UNK> i won't tell you what happened but let's just say it doesn't end well for all of the <UNK> i was used to disney type nature films where the animals don't really die oh man this movie made me cry for hours it was a good movie i think i was really little and truth be told all i remember is being happy for the <UNK> and then seeing one of them die rent it if you can but don't show your kids
<START> spoiler warning br br when the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs the killer breaks a glass of <UNK> next to her to make it appear that she's been drinking but right before she is killed tells her sister's business partner <UNK> <UNK> on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in 4 days yet the police never mention the results of a <UNK> report and the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs huh really bad mistake in this movie which is pretty awful overall br br surprisingly bad considering the great cast some faults the writing isn't very good the music is made for tv bad and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie
<START> were i not with friends and so cheap i would have walked out it failed miserably as satire and didn't even have the redemption of camp
<START> believe me i wanted to like spirit the idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old fashioned hand drawn animation again as if the last <UNK> animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques <UNK> had got my blood up but then the insulting <UNK> <UNK> i had to endure in the first ten minutes of spirit got my blood up even more br br the character designs are generic the animation partly as a result merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly <UNK> <UNK> that you wonder how it could have come about we know from the prince of egypt and the road to el <UNK> that there are talented artists at <UNK> and the sophisticated use of cgi is in every single instance ill judged why do they bother there's not a single thing worth looking at in an animated cartoon this is fatal br br but it gets worse br br the horses can't talk but they're far more <UNK> and unconvincing than the deer in <UNK> which can and it seems that in a way the horses can talk spirit himself delivers the prologue sounding for all the world like a 21st century actor picked out of a shopping mall in california and from then on his laid back decidedly <UNK> narration is <UNK> absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasn't capable of expressing twice as well that prologue by the way a contains information which spirit we later discover had know way of knowing b expresses ideas which spirit would lack the power to express even if he could talk c includes new age rubbish like this story may not be true but it's what i remember and d will give countless children the production is pitched i presume at six year olds the impression that horses are native to north america which is sort of true in that the common <UNK> of domestic horses <UNK> etc was native to north america but all horse species on the continent had gone <UNK> long before the first humans arrived and the <UNK> of <UNK> herd which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass were <UNK> from horses introduced by europeans br br so the prologue rather annoyed me br br as often as spirit talks bryan adams sings sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat <UNK> and it's not that he sings or even how he sings it's what he sings <UNK> narrative <UNK> which contribute even less if possible than <UNK> spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune although i was paying close attention and was able to <UNK> that they probably didn't if only bryan adams and the guy pretending to be a horse could have shut up for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form mediocre and derivative rather than jaw <UNK> bad
<START> i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they <UNK> in this <UNK> bad dialogue worse worst acting lifeless all the way and the cast knew it the two <UNK> movies which this attempted to copy had life <UNK> and were captivating
<START> i'm a sucker for a good romance but this one doesn't qualify as either good or a romance i had the plot nailed down before the credits were through with such poor dialog plot and character development i suggest <UNK> your hour and a half <UNK> i had to rush out and rent <UNK> for the third time so i could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth
<START> demons iii the ogre is not related pre sequel are on the demons and the demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic demons iii the ogre is very stupid bored cheap monster i am very confuse about the writer is demons iii the ogre <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored william shakespeare ghost or <UNK> egg from <UNK> web or what <UNK> make the girl dream i am very sorry very very very very boring movie i bought the special dvd box called demons on the 3 different movies called demons iii the ogre the other hell and black demons don't have closed <UNK> and subtitles is cost 14 99 from best buy store in the city of downey why the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like halloween iii don't have michael <UNK> monster but the people wear halloween i am very confused i really love the demons and the demons 2 are better the boring stupid demons iii the ogre is not part for the demons and the demons 2 are same demons br br thank you juan antonio de la <UNK>
<START> oh this was a really bad movie the girl who plays jennifer is ok but i think she acts bitchy through the movie not because she is having her organs ripped out by a <UNK> at night but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap faye <UNK> acts like she is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the ending is completely silly i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work <UNK> house of <UNK> like family curse and being buried alive still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film
<START> sure it may not be a classic but it's one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later maybe it was on <UNK> one too many times michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie he can't seem to figure out how to play it but he's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with friends it'll make it even better
<START> the first time i ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a wee <UNK> my dad actually recorded it off the tv i must have watched is over 20 times before the relatively recent release on dvd br br i of course bought and watched the dvd and was taken <UNK> by how much the dialogue had changed in the first version which i still have on vhs the mood of the film thanks to the dialogue was actually very dark however the new version featuring van der <UNK> et al is more comic br br to put it another way it's like watching the original us release of <UNK> with that dub before watching the <UNK> version with the literal translation of the japanese br br i'm in no way complaining the story and quality of animation are not <UNK> from but it does raise the question of whether miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his film
<START> this movie is <UNK> bad it begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a <UNK> puppet of a t rex that talks to the audience it goes back and forth between <UNK> <UNK> and animation throughout probably because the film makers couldn't afford live actors i'll spare you the long tiresome relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutes br br one of my friends found this very rare video at a <UNK> shop somewhere that sells out of print b movies and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it but as it turns out our <UNK> was not <UNK> this film makes fun of itself better than we could br br i thought that ed <UNK> plan 9 from outer space was the <UNK> movie in existence but leave it to <UNK> <UNK> cars <UNK> puppets to <UNK> him if you see this movie anywhere buy it without <UNK> it is very rare and worth many many good laughs
<START> this <UNK> bizarre adaptation of <UNK> short story is typical cox his strong visual sense is as usual <UNK> by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast the film is definitely in the surreal tradition of <UNK> mexican period and looks at times like a poor man's take on lars von <UNK> elements of crime <UNK> apparent <UNK> for single takes jump cuts and <UNK> sound recording all work against the film's <UNK> worth a look but ultimately disappointing
<START> i honestly want the last 30 <UNK> of my life back br br the only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen <UNK> i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better br br then the zombies finally showed up and they had some <UNK> paint on there eyes br br they talked like regular people br br one drove a car br br some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to dance br br that was it out came the movie i couldn't take it any longer can i sue for a <UNK> hour of my life
<START> i rarely comment on films but i've read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people <UNK> this celluloid rubbish i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want all i can say is it is a terrible film the content is poor and offensive the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this <UNK> today
<START> being s club seven the film already <UNK> an <UNK> atmosphere but seriously oprah has a point when claiming don't go there girl spice world suddenly doesn't seem to be all that bad i take my money elsewhere
<START> to be a buster keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis most of us first encounter keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production 'the <UNK> 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we <UNK> him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy and we want to see more of his movies here the <UNK> begins after <UNK> bill <UNK> keaton's brother in law joseph <UNK> <UNK> him into <UNK> a contract that put keaton under the control of mgm keaton became just one more actor for hire performing someone else's scripts then his alcoholism got worse after <UNK> bill <UNK> keaton never again made a truly first rate film a couple of sources describe a would be masterpiece comedy that keaton claimed he almost got to make at mgm a parody of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> has offered convincing evidence that keaton made up this story br br the <UNK> <UNK> because among the many years of keaton's long steady decline he just occasionally came up with a good film such as his short comedy <UNK> slam <UNK> i continue to search for the lost footage of keaton's dramatic scene with spencer tracy in <UNK> a mad mad <UNK> a sequence in which <UNK> cop tracy <UNK> an old retired crook keaton and tries to <UNK> his assistance in stealing <UNK> <UNK> cash that footage is almost certainly gone forever but i keep looking br br <UNK> <UNK> alas is one of keaton's films from the beginning of his decline mgm were trying to build up jimmy <UNK> who <UNK> played <UNK> <UNK> three decades later as a new comedy star unfortunately mgm tried to build up <UNK> by <UNK> him with keaton whose style of comedy was simply <UNK> with <UNK> i'm a fan of both throughout his career <UNK> was a <UNK> scene <UNK> <UNK> he knew that he was being built up at keaton's expense and keaton was the only co star whom <UNK> never attempted to <UNK> br br keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> he plays a <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> college professor named post because he's as wooden as one who receives a letter <UNK> him that he's inherited <UNK> 000 which he must travel to new york city to claim does he make a <UNK> call to <UNK> this does he even check the <UNK> no he takes his life's <UNK> out of the bank and rushes to new york as soon as he's gone <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he wrote the fake letter to <UNK> professor post out of his <UNK> br br post who thinks he's a 3 4 millionaire crosses paths with jimmy dodge <UNK> who's trying to produce a musical <UNK> but hasn't any money the characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing <UNK> simply fail to <UNK> keaton is playing one of those <UNK> like mister logic in <UNK> who <UNK> everything <UNK> plays one of those annoying <UNK> who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in <UNK> there's a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which <UNK> is trying to talk to keaton about money but instead of coming straight out with it <UNK> has to use increasingly contrived <UNK> terms like <UNK> <UNK> and so forth while keaton of course has no idea what <UNK> on about i'll give keaton credit his own dry and dusty <UNK> voice his flat kansas accent is absolutely perfect for the character he's playing here br br sidney <UNK> looking much <UNK> and more handsome here than he would be just a year later is impressive as the <UNK> director of the <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> by professor post henry <UNK> whom i've never found funny is even less funny than usual here offering a running gag with a stupid payoff thelma todd impressed me here in a more villainous version of the role she played in <UNK> <UNK> a much funnier movie edward <UNK> one of my favourite character actors is wasted br br part of the problem with <UNK> <UNK> is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways keaton's lawyer shows up at <UNK> theatre with an <UNK> message for keaton but he isn't there so the lawyer proceeds to <UNK> keaton's personal business to the first total stranger he meets fire that lawyer buster in another scene professor post the guy who's perceived as <UNK> this musical <UNK> into the chorus girls' changing room and all the chorus girls immediately <UNK> and cover themselves i know for a fact that modern chorus girls would never react this way and i seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 <UNK> that way either certainly not in response to the <UNK> controlling their show's <UNK> br br spoilers coming about half an hour into the unfunny <UNK> <UNK> the great jimmy <UNK> seats himself at the piano <UNK> into the camera and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune this is the moment when i thought that at long last this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us alas no most annoying of all is the ending of this film which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy the one in which an utterly incompetent <UNK> becomes a star comedian through his own <UNK> keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of <UNK> directors <UNK> chaplin had already used it in 'the <UNK> br br i very nearly <UNK> in anger and sorrow at the wasted opportunities in <UNK> <UNK> mostly out of respect for the work that keaton <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and miss todd have done elsewhere i'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 br br
<START> warning spoilers br br this is your typical disney film br br 1 <UNK> correct what with the foster home that has an even <UNK> of races br br 2 insults the viewers intellect with its simplistic lines br br 3 the boy's <UNK> father is almost directly taken from the never ending story 2 br br 4 in a world full of crime <UNK> corruption <UNK> and other <UNK> that need to be taken care of only a losing team is worthy of divine <UNK> <UNK> br br 5 did you know that angels don't like swearing where the heck did that come from br br 6 in helping the team the angel cause pain and <UNK> on the <UNK> team very <UNK> indeed br br 7 the team the angels are helping are called can you guess the angels disney at its worst br br 8 just got his training wings <UNK> line br br my <UNK> i did not like it at all
<START> this is a wonderful movie about a <UNK> in a fishing village that could be best described with scene <UNK> and direction of old <UNK> works combined with <UNK> topics of human psychology o shin <UNK> <UNK> shakespeare's drama and hans christian <UNK> tragic and <UNK> the screenplay is wondrous the scenes are colour and beautiful some scenes stay really <UNK> in my mind the plot is interesting and unpredictable each of the characters is very well developed and interesting there is also a little action so if you don't like all the sentiments you'd also come to your costs it is not about mysterious <UNK> and proud samurai with their <UNK> <UNK> all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa certainly worth seeing
<START> i thought the movie i do they don't was fantastic in the past i've watched rob <UNK> on suddenly susan <UNK> place and also <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> place and loved seeing them together again in i do they don't they have great chemistry together i guess being married in real life helps that in the movie they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in love and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dropping the ball of course they stumble but they keep it together which is what working and raising a family is all about so many people have been talking about this movie all good and the movie left us wanting more this would make a great series appealing to many ages it would be so nice to see a real life down to earth family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today instead of the so called reality tv that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here
<START> love trap is a must see independent film when i sat down to watch the movie i came in with low expectations but left with a <UNK> the story is poetic <UNK> and creative the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be the movie displayed what love really is action not emotion i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie the entire presentation <UNK> my expectations i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds
<START> even longtime shirley fans may be surprised by now and forever the movie was filmed with paramount studios  not with <UNK> parent company <UNK> century fox  in 1934 before fox producer <UNK> <UNK> had <UNK> the successful shirley formula cute songs cold hearts for her to melt young couples for her to play <UNK> to happy endings thus now and forever falls into the category of a shirley vehicle without the standard shirley story it is an awkward position for any movie but this impressive talented cast makes it work br br gary cooper and carole lombard star as fun loving irresponsible con artists jerry and toni day the only thing that this devoted yet dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart when they are suddenly landed with custody of <UNK> young daughter penny shirley temple it is toni  and not penny as many believe  who <UNK> jerry to give up his criminal career but jerry <UNK> at his desk job and desperate to prove that he can provide for his new family he soon returns to <UNK> and <UNK> in a standard shirley device penny tries to melt the heart of <UNK> <UNK> felix evans the victim of one of <UNK> cons but her attempt fails for evans is revealed to be a con artist himself and he <UNK> jerry into helping him steal <UNK> the drama <UNK> death and sorrow that follow all make this film a very unusual one for little miss sunshine there is no happy ending no dancing and only one song sequence the cute number the world owes me a living br br but this does not mean that shirley fans should avoid now and forever rather it's <UNK> from the usual shirley story make it more interesting and memorable than many of her other films but beware you should avoid <UNK> version of this film and see it in black and white if you can the color is bright <UNK> and unrealistic and in many scenes <UNK> famous <UNK> are actually red instead of blonde <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie recently 2 hours later my head still hurt from laughing the plot was <UNK> awful the jokes were <UNK> bad but what i didn't count on were br br 1 the 2 scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing that caused more than enough laughter br br 2 the kick through the <UNK> that decapitated the evil <UNK> br br this movie is about 20 times better than the rush hour series and my copy even came with a <UNK> saying if you didn't like the movie send <UNK> to hbo while i considered it the date you had to send it in was january 1991 which also caused <UNK> to ensue
<START> this movie is more <UNK> than ever using a suspenseful looking actor like walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one and the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just <UNK> your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there i'd rather watch cartoons for goodness <UNK> leave this one alone please
<START> a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she <UNK> with as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in or else have her father die see now that's what you happens when you fly coach stuff like that never happens in first class br br other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight the other thing that this movie shares with <UNK> is the sheer <UNK> if that's a word of the story the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a <UNK> room so he can be <UNK> which is a pretty plausible plan but won't it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer <UNK> and have them hack into the <UNK> system teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers so i'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of <UNK> on lisa and getting her into the <UNK> that she lands on in the movie br br plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something but i'm 100 sure that i'm reading way too much into it the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of 24 so one can't be <UNK> by such <UNK> for all my complaints though this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done it's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain but at the same time it doesn't require great intelligence to fully enjoy br br i'd love to sit here in my <UNK> chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i can't i love rachel mcadams i love cillian murphy and i like brian cox but they don't really stretch their acting <UNK> here it's not really much of a problem since this isn't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn't the least bit horrible just not great wes craven isn't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing cursed and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it's release br br one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while but nowadays it's like every movie that comes out feels too long where as this movie just felt like the right length not too long and too short they don't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie being a huge film music geek i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by <UNK> <UNK> it's really nice to see <UNK> go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he's doing now i really the cool <UNK> <UNK> stuff he does for the main titles too bad that i can't find the soundtrack anywhere would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it br br overall it's nice for what it is and <UNK> it's far from great cinema should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half
<START> somewhere in his non fiction book <UNK> macabre stephen king suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them if at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall <UNK> through the reader may be a little scared but he'll also think well i can deal with that at least it wasn't a hundred feet tall there's nothing more frightening than what <UNK> unseen and unknown just on the other side of that tightly closed door waiting to get you br br the haunting is so completely <UNK> that director jan de <UNK> more or less starts off his movie by <UNK> throwing open that door himself and yelling look everybody look it's a ten foot tall bug isn't that scary the law of <UNK> returns immediately kicks in by the end of the movie the director is so to speak jumping up and down <UNK> his cgi <UNK> and pans <UNK> and <UNK> screaming look everyone look here come ten hundred foot tall bugs and now here come a hundred thousand foot tall bugs br br the filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this <UNK> and there are many they can't and don't in fact impressive as they are the special effects are so <UNK> and <UNK> that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them whether in admiration or annoyance instead of being immersed in a story br br for me the <UNK> of this film's sheer stupidity comes when a statue with blood <UNK> from its mouth tries to <UNK> liam neeson as dr <UNK> in a <UNK> the filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it so they just have neeson <UNK> around in the water a bit <UNK> his arms and going <UNK> <UNK> by the next scene the good doctor has apparently <UNK> himself off and ho hum forgotten all about the annoying incident br br shirley jackson's novel seems to have been <UNK> down into this ridiculous screenplay by a <UNK> of low iq teenage <UNK> who thought the way to <UNK> people was to make every effect bigger and <UNK> okay next let's uh make the ceiling you know look like a creepy face and uh come down on her and all these <UNK> things like trap her in the bed br br the sole saving grace of the haunting is that it at last becomes so awful that it's actually funny by the time owen wilson as luke <UNK> fell on the floor and then went on his magic carpet ride <UNK> death i just about fell on the floor myself laughing br br badly constructed witless <UNK> heavy handed utterly unbelievable and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes this vacuous haunting is a <UNK> example of how not to make a horror movie
<START> a novel by <UNK> a cast that looks great on paper a left wing <UNK> struggling to remain in paris between the wars a <UNK> officer undercover br br it's a pity there's no <UNK> here the bits and pieces never <UNK> br br stories about left wing <UNK> in france don't have to be this dull read arthur <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the earth if you can find it or his chilling dialogue with death <UNK> br br to me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details br br the leads spend a lot of time drinking <UNK> the norman apple <UNK> i welcome any <UNK> to have a <UNK> of <UNK> myself it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly but according to the film it's only sold in cheap low class <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> that's what i say references to <UNK> <UNK> do abound here that would seem to be a <UNK> of the <UNK> br br i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background i wasn't disappointed this time it was for <UNK> a very unusual choice this film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the <UNK> of its booze <UNK> br br the film's indifferent score is by louis <UNK> <UNK> is best known if you can call it that for his opera the emperor jones based on the o'neill play it <UNK> at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul <UNK> the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence <UNK> it should surface again soon though they're running out of potentially <UNK> operas to revive br br opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles <UNK> character <UNK> under his czech <UNK> two of them are <UNK> and <UNK> both prominent roles in german opera is that just coincidence br br name dropping just seems to be part of this film notice that they call up <UNK> on the phone <UNK> happens to be one of the main characters in <UNK> earlier all quiet on the western front br br well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn't time to develop any drama
<START> i thought that mr dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and the dictator his co star mr julia played his role equally as perfect it was interesting to see how reluctant richard dreyfuss was in replacing the dictator against his will but he became more confident and comfortable with the role as time passed since everything happens for a reason in life i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did i'm guessing that he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life was compared to the poverty he witnessed in <UNK> i think he took too many things for granted in life and he needed to get a serious reality check by remaining in that country for as long as he did br br but anyways this is why i gave this film a 7 out of 10
<START> who did the research for this film it's set in <UNK> in 2004 however all the soldiers are wearing <UNK> and have all universal <UNK> pattern gear no one was wearing that stuff in <UNK> br br i just saw this film while <UNK> overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf this movie made no sense had characters come and go with no explanation and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life i realize that it's a movie but it's obviously trying to portray something realistic it fails miserably but it's trying br br it's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas <UNK> them up and <UNK> then <UNK> out a film i would not recommend this film to anyone i'm still not sure why i sat through the whole thing <UNK> joe was one that really made you think compared to this stay away
<START> this film has been <UNK> me since the first day i saw it br br my mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in <UNK> i remember being <UNK> up in the middle of the night by her <UNK> <UNK> as my dad helped her up the stairs br br she was saying something like don't let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in black br br so obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s out of me i've been <UNK> to horror films since watching this
<START> i'm getting a little tired of people <UNK> god's name to <UNK> their own <UNK> view on the world well i don't dismiss the idea of <UNK> or the coming of the anti christ i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good lives they seem to be mostly white christian children will go to heaven while the rest of us must suffer through a <UNK> of hell on earth just because we weren't good enough god may be a judge but i don't think he is going to measure every level of goodness give the creator some credit
<START> this two <UNK> was excellent the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were <UNK> from previous films but what tv shows don't do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci fi story a great big really scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the <UNK> the best new aliens the <UNK> series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters complete with a couple of <UNK> <UNK> security people in true star trek fashion some large scale philosophical themes love loyalty faith etc and some top <UNK> special effects br br i loved every minute of this
<START> i read the novel some years ago and i liked it a lot when i saw the movie i couldn't believe it they changed everything i liked about the novel even the plot i wonder what did <UNK> <UNK> author say about the movie but i think it sucks
<START> seriously why do american and <UNK> actors pretending to be <UNK> need to speak perfect english with a fake russian accent i am a man so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity but a soft porn flick would have more of that and at least wouldn't pretend it's artistic br br all the political statements where painfully <UNK> has the director heard of subtlety the acting was also woody and melodramatic and the comic relief was never funny the characters were very shallow and i just couldn't identify with them at all br br the bit where i did laugh was when they cut the actors into <UNK> footage of the <UNK> in <UNK> and they were black and white and then <UNK> to match the footage just ludicrous br br i read many of <UNK> short stories not the unbearable <UNK> of being and there are good things about his style of writing although his themes are one big male fantasy and i have to say the film did not convey any of the goodness of <UNK> style
<START> while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the u s now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyone's jobs being <UNK> by u s <UNK> while the government <UNK> and american suffer br br peter <UNK> is <UNK> a steel worker who works the same job his father did for 35 years his wife is well portrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when <UNK> loses his job the mill is closed under the <UNK> of <UNK> but there is also <UNK> and cheaper <UNK> where they can pay one <UNK> in one month <UNK> what they would have to pay <UNK> <UNK> in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their family br br john goodman gary cole as <UNK> brother and a few other co workers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between <UNK> and his father are moving <UNK> hopes his local union will be able to re open the mill as they promise to do so br br <UNK> brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the <UNK> belt <UNK> and they must move on however where in the u s can they move to where will it be better for a blue collar steel worker br br there is a <UNK> scene at the end where <UNK> and his crew fill the <UNK> <UNK> with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy br br overall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected 8 10
<START> michelle rodriguez plays diana a high school girl with an <UNK> <UNK> and 2 x 4 on her shoulder she's ready to battle anyone especially her father who is paying for her brother's boxing lessons diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger br br i liked the relationship between diana and adrian <UNK> douglas as adrian is excellent watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the <UNK> circle
<START> this film is very interesting i have seen it twice and it seems glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish i for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current <UNK> corporate drivel that is an <UNK> in our every media center and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not think about due to corporate media control the outrage that glover expresses through the outrageous elements in the films is both clear in its visceral <UNK> and beautiful in its poetic <UNK> i am glad i saw this film and it is even <UNK> that glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy it is fine everything is fine see that also people that dismiss this film as <UNK> or pretentious are really missing the boat this is an intelligent films if you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books that is also very <UNK> while the way you get in to his mindset is really something you will have an experience
<START> well i suppose the good news concerning william <UNK> 2001 <UNK> the double d <UNK> is that it manages to <UNK> three of russ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> de la <UNK> in one picture i can only assume that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were busy the week they shot this thing or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance the bad news though and there's plenty of it is that this film if it can even be called that having been shot straight to video is a complete misfire a total abortion an out and out atrocity an absolute abomination and truly one of the worst pictures that i have ever seen look no further for the <UNK> superhero movie ever made the plot here such as it is deals with <UNK> gaining <UNK> after <UNK> the rare <UNK> plant in south america to cure her breast cancer <UNK> and later battling a trio of <UNK> bikini dancers back in l a too bad that every lame <UNK> joke <UNK> out falls completely you should <UNK> the expression flat that there is zero actual nudity in the film at all other than some old photos of <UNK> in her <UNK> and that some <UNK> cream and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are the sum total of the special fx the meyer <UNK> here are a bit long in the tooth <UNK> in the chest to put it kindly although <UNK> dawn thomas as bikini girl <UNK> <UNK> does manage to uh stand out nicely so why have i given this juvenile unfunny failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 to be <UNK> joe bob <UNK> his voice over commentary in the special features of the dvd i just watched is absolutely hilarious especially when he pulls out around 100 <UNK> for the word breast from the 1 000 on his web <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> list the man is a national treasure and he manages to <UNK> this <UNK> of a disc to coaster status
<START> i can't say that <UNK> the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i've ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or <UNK> <UNK> intent was so <UNK> obvious it was impossible to get into the movie br br i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the <UNK> attempts to <UNK> the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie
<START> i read a few reviews of this tv movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only <UNK> entertainment i agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long <UNK> would have been enough but i certainly do not think it <UNK> the subject matter jim jones' <UNK> power trip and slow <UNK> into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a <UNK> manner the movie takes its time in showing how jones <UNK> followers brenda <UNK> and brad <UNK> character are stand outs in that matter but also in <UNK> an uncanny shift in jones' perception of reality it is mind <UNK> to see an <UNK> left wing and <UNK> preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator perhaps the movie doesn't explore jones' motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well but powers <UNK> mesmerizing performance makes it all come true i am not familiar with the details of the real jim jones' life but <UNK> sure makes the monster he plays believable and real the movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching <UNK> of jones <UNK> meeting with father divine a <UNK> james earl jones <UNK> leo ryan ned beatty 's visit to the <UNK> camp and of course the suicide scene it is quite a gloomy <UNK> to watch and <UNK> is quite commanding in those last moments <UNK> <UNK> shines in this scene as one of the suddenly <UNK> <UNK> and so do <UNK> <UNK> as jones' wife and brad <UNK> especially when their time comes to drink the murderous <UNK> the relative calm of the end of this scene the <UNK> direction and the <UNK> beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to <UNK> from one's mind a disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century not to let it be repeated again like ironically the <UNK> in jim jones' camp those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it
<START> this is not really a proper review since i did not see most of the film i stopped watching it the film is very violent with nasty drug dealers and street <UNK> but that is not why i stopped watching br br here was the problem i watched just enough to be introduced to several characters all of whom were not interesting everyone was a tedious despicable psychopath with no engaging personalities giving me nothing to look forward to i found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them br br if there had been even one person of interest and i don't mean good or nice person i mean an interesting person i could have stayed with it watch state of grace to see what i mean in that film the gary <UNK> character is a complete lunatic but he is very interesting al pacino perhaps did a good job in scarface but his character just did not engage me
<START> it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show this makes every show i've ever watched look plain boring the moment the first episode aired i was <UNK> and i became attached to all the characters so easy which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters it is a pity this show won't have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't <UNK> my feelings for the show at all nothing can ever replace pushing daisies because what could abc possibly find to replace this show this is easily the best show on television br br i came for <UNK> <UNK> and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show
<START> it really <UNK> me that it got made the director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way <UNK> pass script stage what i want you to consider is this while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him <UNK> hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write 'the jokes didn't appeal to <UNK> but the reality is for them to appeal to you you'd have to be the man who wrote them or a <UNK> so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn't it
<START> spoilers since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece <UNK> murder mystery writer <UNK> mitchell ruth gordon has strong <UNK> that it was <UNK> husband edmund <UNK> charles frank who was responsible for her death in fact <UNK> is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident br br knowing that there's no evidence to have edmund arrested for <UNK> death and deciding to take the law into her own hands <UNK> <UNK> up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look like <UNK> death a tragic accident getting edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk in safe as she's about to leave on vacation for new york city <UNK> tricks him into going inside <UNK> the <UNK> and surprised edmund in with the safe being <UNK> nobody at the mansion the butler maid and <UNK> personal secretary <UNK> <UNK> hartley hear him screaming for help and the next day edmund is found <UNK> to death <UNK> discovered <UNK> body as she was about to put away for safe keeping <UNK> latest murder mystery <UNK> br br lt columbo peter falk is called on the case involving the strange death of edmund <UNK> to determine if it's a murder or a tragic accident going through <UNK> apartment columbo is puzzled to find out that he doesn't have a single photo of his late wife who's been missing for just a month this ties into what <UNK> always felt about him in edmund not being in love with <UNK> and also a suspect in her in <UNK> mind murder br br columbo a big fan together with his wife of <UNK> murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for <UNK> death all the evidence points to <UNK> including a pair of missing car keys that was <UNK> this all proved that <UNK> was in fact in the house not on her way to the airport when edmund was locked inside the walk in safe br br going through all the evidence columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is that conclusion is quickly <UNK> when it's found out that edmund didn't even have a pen or <UNK> as well as light with the safe light <UNK> burned out on him to write it there's also something very odd that's inside the safe that has been on lt <UNK> mind ever since he came on the case this has to do with the black paint <UNK> that was found under the dead <UNK> <UNK> and on his belt <UNK> br br it's that evidence when put together with a number of other items in the safe that in the end hangs <UNK> murder on the <UNK> and very cunning mystery writer <UNK> mitchell edmund let <UNK> <UNK> convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up by his breathing in using burnt out <UNK> to write on <UNK> last <UNK> who murdered him <UNK> mitchell
<START> i wasn't expecting much of this film a fun little <UNK> <UNK> heights could be turned into a plausible modern story nice and <UNK> melodramatic and intriguing but this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a <UNK> version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it <UNK> heights at all it ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable mostly unsympathetic and frequently cruel to one another it changes the very nature of certain characters isabelle for instance in the novel had not a conniving bone in her body they've stripped her blind <UNK> and turned her into a scheming whore <UNK> is an awful person who psychologically <UNK> most people in his path but in this version catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care the dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces in place of depth or actual emotions we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face i've read criticism of the early 90's version emily <UNK> <UNK> heights which featured ralph <UNK> and juliette <UNK> saying that it turned an intensely dark gothic story into a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slightly valid comments but the mtv version goes a step further using the basic story structure to deliver <UNK> beach <UNK> <UNK> to really bad music
<START> i'm a big fan of westerns but this one <UNK> what a stinker i think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog i think i could have written better dialog than this when i was in <UNK> grade and the poor actors given this terrible dialog none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous really i'm not kidding some of this is little better than what you'd get in an ed wood film br br the biggest tragedy is sterling hayden he was probably the big star in this movie which if you called it a b western you'd be <UNK> praise upon it this is what should be called a b minus western perhaps pity sterling hayden who appeared at other times along with joan crawford bette davis frank sinatra and other major talents for him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to <UNK> for the rest of his life br br one annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven't <UNK> in a week and their faces are all <UNK> i know in the old west guys weren't always well <UNK> but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go <UNK> ' really this is a crummy western denver <UNK> also had to live this one down especially after appearances in so many great westerns bad bad movie
<START> a very young ginger rogers <UNK> quick <UNK> and one liners with rival newspaper reporter <UNK> <UNK> in this 1933 murder mystery from poverty row film maker allied productions the movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a <UNK> from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a <UNK> apartment rogers actually has two identities at the film's outset that of miss terry the dead <UNK> secretary along with her newspaper <UNK> of pat morgan <UNK> <UNK> her story directly to ted <UNK> <UNK> instead of her <UNK> rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he's been out <UNK> br br here's a puzzle it's revealed during police inspector <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> investigation of <UNK> death that terry morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks why exactly was that after the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before clues are dropped regarding <UNK> association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn't relevant until it's all linked up to janitor peterson harvey clark and who's making up all the calling cards with the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> with the words you will hear it cut and <UNK> beneath apparently the <UNK> sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment <UNK> <UNK> system which peterson used to <UNK> a <UNK> gas into the rooms of potential victims such as mrs <UNK> in the apartment below <UNK> but in answer to a question <UNK> to inspector russell about mrs <UNK> death he <UNK> apparently to the cause of <UNK> br br it's these rather <UNK> plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me the revelation of janitor peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of miss morgan in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however and score another point against continuity we see miss morgan in a huge basement room as peterson <UNK> the <UNK> she made her <UNK> but how and still pretty as a picture and who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than <UNK> police assistant <UNK> arthur <UNK> who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room br br sorry but for all those reviewers who found a <UNK> in the night to be a satisfying <UNK> i feel that any charlie chan film of the same era is a <UNK> the usual suspects by comparison if you need a reason to see the film it would be ginger rogers but be advised she doesn't dance
<START> the plot of <UNK> of <UNK> is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is <UNK> by a gang of <UNK> but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do she finally gets her revenge that's about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets it has to be the director mamet lindsay <UNK> has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career so she can't perform this badly all the time she's supposed to go from uptight cool controlled professional to <UNK> wicked fast lady having fun as shown by the change from <UNK> <UNK> suit which she seems to wear for three days straight including underwear to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same <UNK> precise way i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a <UNK> of his <UNK> script got missed the effect is unsettling and <UNK> the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create at times <UNK> of <UNK> loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk and becomes just a <UNK> to spin out the plot the clunky <UNK> faux jazz soundtrack doesn't help either the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic two dimensional performances and they smoke too much
<START> i can safely admit as an imdb geek that <UNK> <UNK> will never crack into my film noir top twenty it may not even sneak into the top fifty but rather than <UNK> the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre it should be noted that <UNK> <UNK> has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing all that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning br br the film doesn't get cooking until <UNK> ella raines sets about trying to prove all but single <UNK> the innocence of her boss scott anderson alan curtis who has been convicted of murder <UNK> is <UNK> secretary by day and amateur detective by night as the <UNK> sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of new york at night little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together to be honest the film belongs to raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest i'm not sure if this <UNK> dynamic of a <UNK> leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film br br as interesting as raines is as a <UNK> detective things really <UNK> into another hidden gear when <UNK> pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer elisha cook jr in search of some information to help her condemned boss she and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the all night jazz <UNK> trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet it could ruin the scene all together you'll know the scene once the last <UNK> crash has finished <UNK> out if you're lucky enough to have this film on dvd you'll more than likely be <UNK> this scene again and again as good as raines is it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy it is mainly because of this scene that i rate <UNK> <UNK> a 7 instead of a 6 br br for the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene it is the <UNK> sex <UNK> that <UNK> this film from any others of the same <UNK> br br and just like it is said in the film that you never go wrong with vanilla i would also like to add that going with vanilla is the safe fall back choice when one can't decide on having a <UNK> treat br br 7 10 clark richards
<START> action violence sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie and everything they do is done without reason mark l lester is un known for his violent without reason movies <UNK> the base the story is weird but stupid the actors play their stupid characters very well i'm not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors it's another low budget unknown b series action movie if you saw something like operation <UNK> force drive the <UNK> <UNK> or something like these bad movies from the same kind than <UNK> don't rent it and by the way don't rent any of the movies i mentioned i give it <UNK> a half out <UNK>
<START> note that i did not say that it is better just more enjoyable the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving br br i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie as it has all the troma <UNK> including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the villain after every murder a ridiculous <UNK> rape scene which is sort of hard to get upset about since the rapist is a snowman and dumb <UNK> br br there's a lot to love br br 1 a snowman about whom it is <UNK> that he has no legs or feet drives a police <UNK> around town br br 2 even though it is supposed to be close to or below <UNK> <UNK> breath shows and there are no signs of car <UNK> when cars are running br br 3 the snow reminds you more of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> than actual snow br br 4 a teenage girl gets the <UNK> for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is <UNK> murdered she talks him into breaking into the <UNK> house of all places in order to get it on but first she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the <UNK> and open some wine br br 5 after teen aged <UNK> head is cut off by a <UNK> runner his father <UNK> with the sheriff about whether tommy the <UNK> son had anything to do with it the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn't have been fighting with jake because jake is at least two feet <UNK> than tommy at that moment someone in the background <UNK> in not anymore br br 6 when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away the sheriff <UNK> with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber <UNK> or <UNK> wrestling with stuffed lions if i were an actor i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point br br all in all a fun film there's not really even that much blood
<START> halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time it's that day of the year i even watch it sometimes when it's not the holiday this film is so great jamie lee curtis is an actress i can never stop loving this movie might be old but the story line still gets me right there every time and the acting was absolutely fantastic although i have not seen the remake i feel already that it was totally unnecessary i think rob zombie should have never remade such a classic what kills me though is to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the original i am getting furious just thinking about it this movie was great and it will always be remembered in history as a classic
<START> <UNK> writer george <UNK> alan <UNK> takes on an assignment for sports illustrated he is to go <UNK> to the detroit lions training camp and try out for a position as third string <UNK> he is quickly found out by the team members featuring alex <UNK> and mike <UNK> the entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling <UNK> in the writer's determination to <UNK> for a series in a real game br br this movie is <UNK> debut and also helped <UNK> leave the <UNK> for acting besides the 1968 detroit lions the cast also includes sugar ray robinson roy <UNK> and lauren <UNK> br br alex march directs this story based on <UNK> book
<START> characters you don't care about relationships you don't care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start julia roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other she was actually somewhat endearing in this role
<START> i question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the btk killer's motives are they attempting to portray animal rights <UNK> as sick monsters who is responsible for this don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough what a blatant <UNK> and exploitation of the victims it was like a personality experiment what <UNK> you more the <UNK> or the human murders they used actual names of some of the victims this movie was hideous <UNK> and insulting the creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda people need to <UNK> and <UNK> the line
<START> this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the <UNK> in new york what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause one of the most important movies of all time the elements are simple yet fascinating the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds yet the story is always believable and never depressing the characters are so realistic a city <UNK> would recognize them as neighbors the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending buy this one for your permanent collection it is a piece of american history
<START> 30 seconds into the opening credits i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie but i didn't know just how bad then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie we'll have to turn the volume down make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd but that didn't help about half way through we turned it off now i've lived through some very bad movies before both with and without the <UNK> of mystery science theater 3000 and <UNK> but there are just some movies which i doubt even the <UNK> can save the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people <UNK> into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin i guess they were all <UNK> into death then <UNK> into rotting themselves stick to the real b movie cult classics like plan nine from outer space
<START> the only reason the <UNK> tapes deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast other than getting to see angie baby in a pre police woman performance there's nothing else worth seeing here br br the synopsis br br minor spoilers br br david <UNK> is <UNK> to write a book on the supernatural one day he mysteriously disappears after <UNK> his <UNK> and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the <UNK> tapes a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural br br in the pilot episode a wealthy <UNK> dies but not before <UNK> an ancient egyptian <UNK> ring from a local <UNK> who <UNK> him the <UNK> will give him <UNK> after death we soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant <UNK> instead it only <UNK> the <UNK> corpse allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town <UNK> pretty girls of all their blood br br blue faced yellow eyed and <UNK> out <UNK> you haven't heard since you last watched scooby doo cartoons the <UNK> attacks his wife dickinson one dark night she escapes and via a mutual <UNK> contacts <UNK> to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny <UNK> on her estate br br so is this guy a vampire no there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard the <UNK> doesn't drink his <UNK> blood he <UNK> it how don't know we only see him attacking never collecting why to fulfill the second part of his <UNK> for <UNK> it turns out the <UNK> <UNK> will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life size statue of a demon named <UNK> out of a mixture of clay and human blood once it's finished <UNK> plans to inhabit the statue using it as his <UNK> into our world br br the final analysis br br the <UNK> tapes wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason it was garbage as you can see from my synopsis the story is a <UNK> ill conceived mess the acting and dialogue offer no better this isn't even a <UNK> for a so bad it's good award sometimes bad is just bad br br after years of hearing underground <UNK> about the great merits of the <UNK> tapes i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10 15 <UNK> i wish i hadn't set myself up for the fall br br having screened this <UNK> for the first time two days ago i can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis either way they've offered you misleading reviews of the <UNK> tapes br br <UNK> <UNK> october 17 2003
<START> i went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted <UNK> of spiritual new age types who quite unlike me very much enjoyed this movie although according to those that also knew the book apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense the movie is not quite as good so if you tend to think of yourself as spiritual believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like aura and <UNK> body and don't mind the frequent use of the term energy outside of the context of physics or technology you might actually like the movie and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based on br br however if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by inane new age nonsense and plots based <UNK> if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for cheesy lighting effects to <UNK> the happening of <UNK> and perhaps even expect reasonable non wooden dialog an acting then this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie stay away br br don't even think about it tonight this movie <UNK> <UNK> and dragons as the worst movie i ever personally saw in a movie theater i do not count movies i went to see with the expectation of them being bad such as plan 9 etc at the same time it raised the grand total of movies i almost walked out on to two d d being the other one i do not walk out on movies not even on this one but i should've when i first saw the visual depiction of an aura because the new age <UNK> keeps on getting <UNK> and <UNK> from that point on br br the plot is about a group of people involving themselves with some old <UNK> in a quest for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing mankind to the next step in its evolution or something like that they actually talk about this spiritual stuff being the next step in human evolution which should make anybody who has even the <UNK> idea of what human evolution is cringe the movie is shock full with <UNK> like that occasionally people <UNK> to what they would certainly describe as another dimension or perhaps another plane only to become invisible to those around them who haven't yet reached enlightenment goodness br br at the end the director <UNK> the audience by rolling the insights making up the prophecy painfully slow presumably so that we can <UNK> them and leave the cinema as better more <UNK> individuals br br good things about the movie some very pretty nature shots and some decent supporting performances by <UNK> and de <UNK> br br i honestly can say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable it really is el <UNK> <UNK> of the most naive kind and unless that's your thing you better do something else with your time and money
<START> for all its visual <UNK> how much better renaissance would have been in live action the animation is fantastic in the big picture yes but the characters are cold and hollow much like the story and the style of this film with real actors perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless there is much to admire here but at the end i found that all i could do was admire i did not enjoy the movie that much and it <UNK> something that i did not see before that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film but without a good story and strong characters it can all be for nothing i will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing but sometimes it comes dangerously close i love dark sci fi thrillers blade runner and dark city are two films i thought were wonderful but blade runner had its tragic villain and dark city had its thought provoking story arc renaissance has shadow and light but little else i wish i could have liked this movie more but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that the renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life how ironic then that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies i've seen this year takes its title from the renaissance
<START> true story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins <UNK> the waters amusing though not really good monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy an amusing exploitation film thats <UNK> silly in the right frame of mind my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago
<START> somewhat too long and going over the top towards the end this comedy is an utterly delightful never condescending or <UNK> look into the problems of a power man who likes to wear <UNK> clothes at <UNK> br br julie <UNK> is lovely as always but adrian <UNK> is utterly credible and steals the film he she is absolutely gorgeous in high heels and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'd have given this film a few stars simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here new york city most on this channel whether set there in rural <UNK> <UNK> virginia l a etc are filmed in <UNK> <UNK> toronto or some other canadian locale br br but if there ever were one deserving the top rating 10 on this site it's this movie certainly not for originality for this story has been done many times in many variations with several very similar to this specific one it's also been done pretty often on the big screen with mega stars past and present from cary grant james garner harrison ford tom hanks et al and deborah kerr doris day meg ryan and many more i can think of at least 10 12 more just as prominent past to present off the top of my head who could be added now and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind br br not to <UNK> on but my point is that in my opinion this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen i caught it by chance on a mid day friday at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly <UNK> week i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made and while the two leads have done enough to be known to most they were completely unknown to me the only two actors i knew were <UNK> newman <UNK> mother whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days and michael <UNK> henry charlie's best friend who was outstanding as <UNK> the menacing juice <UNK> tough street guy from <UNK> br br the chance meeting and <UNK> between both <UNK> best friends as a sub story romance with the <UNK> of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later is an <UNK> done plot <UNK> within the genre but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact it enhances it br br checking some other comments i agree completely with those which are the most positive the primary word describing this film is engaging in <UNK> this <UNK> describes the performers the characters the chemistry between and among all of the characters in whatever combination presented and all of the supporting and even minor roles br br i love films with a harder edge <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> stallone fare <UNK> even the classics like casablanca gone with the wind citizen kane but for pure <UNK> enjoyment this one was outstanding with a bare <UNK> of their budgets it was equal to the results achieved by you've got mail and <UNK> in seattle and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha <UNK> and michael <UNK> here the co stars and support <UNK> here were equivalent to those in these mega films as well
<START> i love ghost stories in general but i particularly love <UNK> atmospheric and <UNK> creepy british period style ghost stories this one qualifies on all counts a naive young lawyer <UNK> in <UNK> is sent to a small village near the <UNK> to settle an elderly deceased woman's estate it's the 1920s a time when many middle class brits go to the <UNK> on vacation for their health well guess what there's nothing healthy about the village of <UNK> <UNK> the creepy site of the elderly woman's <UNK> brooding victorian estate which is located on the <UNK> of a fog <UNK> salt <UNK> when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl none of the locals will help the <UNK> <UNK> you find out why later on in the film he inadvertently <UNK> the wrath of a <UNK> spirit the woman in black she is no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but a solid black <UNK> of <UNK> and evil the viewer only sees her a few times but you feel her <UNK> presence in every frame as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he's reading through legal papers you expect to see the woman in black at any moment when the lawyer goes out to the <UNK> shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house the camera snakes in on him and you think she'll pop up there too waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail <UNK> suspenseful we've seen many elements of this story before the locked room that no one enters the fog the naive <UNK> who ignores the <UNK> <UNK> but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new seeming and compelling ghost story watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black
<START> this movie is ok if you like mindless action corny acting and a very small plot the special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of event horizon the costumes are like something from a mad max movie none of the soldiers talk so others tell them what to do it eventually end up as a big <UNK> up movie with explosions all the place i personally liked russell better in tango and cash escape from la new york and executive decision it must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no <UNK> action science fiction movie
<START> definitely the product of young minds this piece may very well appeal to the <UNK> crowd who is still trying to find their place in the world while <UNK> over every <UNK> however i can't imagine that the heavy amount of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> trite humor or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30 another problem is that the <UNK> characters whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect that they fail to be <UNK> in any real way br br however one has to give some style points to the filmmakers who obviously grew up in the video generation and use every <UNK> editing trick in the book in order to <UNK> up an otherwise non existent plot there are 2 points to remember here first beware of festival <UNK> second even though we live in the age of youtube not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big screen treatment but these young filmmakers have every right to make their film and if others 20 somethings can find something in it to identify with then all the better yet i could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation just now coming of age will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications in the age when every child is constantly <UNK> of how special they are and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure <UNK> and the ability to deal with <UNK> does not exactly appear to be this <UNK> strong point
<START> watched on <UNK> far too many commercials so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian i'd protest the portrayal of all males as <UNK> and all women as <UNK> they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesn't take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening
<START> this movie was <UNK> awful i can't think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a <UNK> through them the acting was <UNK> <UNK> bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot and dialogue what dialogue to think that i was a fan of the first one i use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is <UNK> bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time 2 10 because it is <UNK> hard for me to give a 1
<START> police <UNK> murder suspicion we are all so <UNK> with them in movies <UNK> most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere however most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones yet it occurs that these people may easily be <UNK> a film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old it is garde a <UNK> a unique movie by claude miller br br is there much of the action not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time but the way they are executed is the movie's great plus <UNK> charles <UNK> michel <UNK> is being <UNK> by inspector <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> guy <UNK> it's a new year's eve a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting yet after the rape and murder of two children at the dawn of the old year the door of suspicion must be open at last in other words more <UNK> from the movie it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is to achieve this one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties br br some people criticize the script for being too <UNK> yet i would ask them what should an investigation be like if not many questions and practically much talk this <UNK> touches the very roots of the genre in no way is this boring but throughout the entire film it makes you as a viewer as an <UNK> involved moreover the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told not too much and not too little of them just enough to make the whole story <UNK> and more interesting the most memorable flashbacks for me are when <UNK> <UNK> schneider <UNK> wife talks about one lovely christmas but these flashbacks also contain the views of the places including the infamous beach it all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace and since i saw garde a <UNK> i always mention this film as one of the <UNK> of french cinema against <UNK> of mess and chaos br br but those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won't find the content and its execution satisfactory yet garde a <UNK> is worth seeing also for such people why for the sake of performances but here don't expect me to praise foremost <UNK> schneider garde a <UNK> is not <UNK> schneider vehicle she does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child she <UNK> portrays a person who is calm <UNK> who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant more credible than the overly <UNK> role of elsa in la <UNK> de sans <UNK> it is still acted however <UNK> schneider does not have much time on screen practically she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits she as a wife and a different viewpoint comes <UNK> with the new year at midnight her role is a purely supporting one who really rocks is <UNK> <UNK> he is the middle aged inspector <UNK> <UNK> who wants to find out the truth who is aware that his questions are <UNK> towards the other <UNK> but does not hesitate he is an inspector who having been married three times is perfectly acknowledged of women's psyche he is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service finally he is a person who does not find it <UNK> to sit there on new year's eve michel <UNK> also does a fine job expressing fear particularly in the final scenes of the movie but thumbs up for mr <UNK> brilliant br br as far as memorable moments are concerned this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily <UNK> the entire film is memorable has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and which i have not mentioned before gorgeous music for me the talk of <UNK> and inspector <UNK> is the most brilliant flawless moment you are there with the two characters you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see br br garde a <UNK> is a very interesting film a must see for thrill lovers and <UNK> of artistic performances new year has turned and is it now easier to open the door you'll find out when you decide to see the <UNK> directed movie by claude miller 8 10
<START> <UNK> this stinks as everyone knows it's based upon some <UNK> insurance commercials what no one knows is why those commercials were amusing on first viewing at best hardly fodder for a series the talking <UNK> <UNK> that's another story now that would make for an intriguing series and why on earth did abc as reported in the press actually agree to buy the <UNK> character rights from <UNK> for this after all the idea of <UNK> struggling in the modern world is hardly unique to tv phil <UNK> had a recurring saturday night live role as the <UNK> <UNK> lawyer over a decade ago and that's how a concept like this works best as an occasional installment but a regular series <UNK> a 1960s series called it's about time also used the <UNK> in the modern world concept it lasted one season br br one of the show's directors who was also responsible for the <UNK> commercials was recently <UNK> as saying we were so excited when we were shooting our commercials because we felt like we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell wrong br br in the <UNK> of bad tv this is destined to take its place alongside <UNK> me and the <UNK> as one of the all time worst the lead actor in the embarrassing <UNK> fiasco actually went into shame by association hiding after it was abruptly canceled no doubt our <UNK> friends will follow suit
<START> a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle they demand a huge <UNK> for her release peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack they try to give the <UNK> fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to <UNK> out in the helicopter the helicopter is shot and they also have to <UNK> from that not going well so far also <UNK> the <UNK> is a devil of sorts in reality its just a naked black guy with <UNK> big eyes and a breathing problem he starts to kill a few of the <UNK> and laura escapes only to be captured by some <UNK> the rest of the film is a bit of a <UNK> really br br now i'm not a massive jess franco fan in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen but even i can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out br br devil hunter is poorly lit <UNK> i don't think it was lit at all badly dubbed poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him it has to be seen to be believed then of course there is the actual devil it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes he has very <UNK> vision br br the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80's here in the uk and was banned now why it was i have no idea there is very little gore at all and it's hardly a shocking film minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth br br there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle it would probably be more fun br br 3 10
<START> german private tv is ill renowned for <UNK> dutch and  naturally  us <UNK> well in the case of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> only went as far as the <UNK> screwball br br you can't stand screwball comedy don't watch <UNK> <UNK> seriously if you expect yet another <UNK> drama <UNK> similar to law order or something well go somewhere else or watch law order as it's quite brilliant at what it does but i <UNK> e s is funny often <UNK> thought provoking themes is funny romantic funny funny and witty too br br frankly i am quite <UNK> the writers didn't get better deals after the <UNK> final and my cynical nature needs to <UNK> itself re private german television productions german residents will understand what i'm talking about br br in short watch it i don't have the <UNK> what the english <UNK> is like but hey it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons pseudo happy end included
<START> firstly there are some good things about this film but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that i've seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but she's a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be not that that has anything to do with the movie and what's with that look she gives everyone perhaps it's part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book it's based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this
<START> what a moving film i have a dear friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years has told me that people don't see her anymore and she <UNK> for <UNK> being in my late 40s i am beginning to see what she has been complaining about you are no longer youthful beautiful or <UNK> when may says this <UNK> of a body wow how our bodies change and how we are told it is no longer beautiful i love when she begins to change what she wears the colorful <UNK> no longer the <UNK> wife br br it is a sad and wonderful picture at the same time sad in that may betrays her daughter's trust beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the affair and chooses to move on and finally have her own life i love the character's daring to even <UNK> the love affair br br mostly i love the movie because finally it is a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships be they <UNK> or not we see <UNK> vulnerability yet she will have what she wants at all costs when she tells her mum that she will have a baby for darren whether he wants one or not after her mother asks if darren even wants a child the movie hits the mark on the how relationships can change and yet reveals what has been there all along <UNK> may has <UNK> her own creativity to raise a family a family that she didn't really want but was something you just did when she was young i love the scene when darren calls her an old <UNK> and she smiles and says i was never called that before it was truly a gem of a movie br br and daniel craig well i just love him i was pleasantly surprised not only is he pleasant on the eyes he is a real talent what a neat role he is much more than any <UNK> that is for sure and i look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature the scene where he is <UNK> may and the look he gives her is sort of a look of wonder that he has such control over this woman and also one of pleasure of being able to give this to her he is actually enjoying giving her pleasure a wonderful scene the contrast is the love scene with bruce bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure two completely different men br br alas i wonder where is my darren
<START> how cynical are the writers to <UNK> so i may be an american citizen but i don't need to see other americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film i'm <UNK> that so few have commented on how utterly <UNK> sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is the historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in u <UNK> which changes british <UNK> to american ones but you still walk away feeling a little slimy really the germans in this film do nothing but admire the americans between battle scenes how sad unnecessary i'd just like to say to the writers it's obvious to many of us that you can't capture real people with real problems under real pressure and that you've taken some very well tested <UNK> lucky for you there will always be <UNK> <UNK> to appreciate your sugar <UNK> tripe
<START> spoilers br br before i begin this let me say that i have had both the <UNK> of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the <UNK> version of this movie remade by stephen king himself in 1997 br br both <UNK> made me appreciate this version of the shining all the more br br also let me say that i've read mr king's book the shining on many occasions over the years and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work stanley kubrick's retelling of this story is far more compelling and scary br br kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film in the direction of the movie and the writing of the screenplay itself he acquired the title <UNK> beyond question kubrick's genius is like magic the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut 1999 full metal jacket 1987 barry <UNK> 1975 a clockwork orange 1971 2001 a space odyssey 1968 <UNK> 1960 and many more br br the <UNK> jack wendy his wife and danny their son are living in the overlook hotel for the winter jack has been hired as the caretaker it is his job to <UNK> the <UNK> of the hotel during the several months of hard snow until spring when the overlook <UNK> its doors it seems there are many wealthy and jaded tourists who will flock to the <UNK> mountains for a snow filled summer <UNK> br br the hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging it <UNK> to the atmosphere by having a dark yet at the same time <UNK> atmosphere itself the <UNK> and furniture was all period late 70's early 80's and the filmography of the landscape approaching the hotel in the opening scene is brilliant it not only lets you enjoy the approach to the overlook it also <UNK> in your mind how deserted and isolated the hotel is from the rest of the world br br the introduction of wendy and <UNK> characters was a stroke of genius you get the whole story of their past <UNK> imaginary friend tony and the story of jack's alcoholism all rolled into this nice neat <UNK> scene there was no need in <UNK> the past history out over two hours of the movie obviously kubrick saw that from the beginning br br closing day again the <UNK> drive up the mountains to the hotel this time with family in <UNK> the interaction between jack and danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange br br the initial tour through the overlook is quite breathtaking even as the staff is moving things out you get a chance to see the <UNK> fire places the high <UNK> <UNK> and expensive <UNK> <UNK> and crown <UNK> in the architecture they did a good job pink and gold are my favorite colors wendy <UNK> even the staff wing is well designed and beautifully built br br the <UNK> was a magnificent touch reminiscent of the <UNK> in which the <UNK> of <UNK> was guardian when jack nicholson stands at the <UNK> model of the <UNK> and stares into the center seeing wendy and danny entering it's a <UNK> moment one that tells you right away there are heavy <UNK> in that house there's something seriously wrong already starting i wouldn't want to go in there unless i had at least an hour to find my way out the hotel manager br br <UNK> <UNK> as dick <UNK> was genuine and open in his performance his smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful you could actually believe you were there in the hotel taking the tour of the kitchen with wendy and doc his explanation of the shining to danny was very well delivered as was his conversation with the child about tony and the hotel it was believable and sincere br br the cut out and pan <UNK> of the hotel itself with the mountains <UNK> behind the cold air <UNK> about <UNK> coming up from the warm roof of the <UNK> hotel adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie it also marks the half way to hell point so to speak the turning point in the movie br br shelley <UNK> portrayal of wendy <UNK> was masterful so what if she also played <UNK> <UNK> it just shows her marvelous diversity honestly before i saw the movie on the big screen in 1980 i said what <UNK> <UNK> lol <UNK> was also released in 1980 but i took that back as soon as the movie started she's brilliant in this <UNK> opinion this is her best performance to date although i did love her in steve <UNK> <UNK> 1987 br br once kubrick has established the <UNK> bits of information of which you the viewer need to be in possession the <UNK> past <UNK> broken arm tony the history of the hotel itself the fact that danny is not mental but rather <UNK> instead and the general <UNK> of the hotel all of which you get in the opening 3 sequences the movie never stops <UNK> you br br the two butchered daughters of the previous caretaker <UNK> grady the girls having appeared several times to danny first by way of tony in the apartment before the family ever left for the hotel were icons with which danny could identify and of which he was afraid at the same time they were haunting and haunted themselves and showed danny how and where they were killed in a rather graphic and material way br br kubrick's tony was written as an attendant spirit like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being <UNK> off his body by his own father he was the little boy who lives in my mouth he would <UNK> in the end of <UNK> finger and physically spoke through danny in order to speak to danny not like in the book i realize where tony was intended by stephen king to be the projection of danny as an older boy trying to save his father kubrick left out that little twist and it somehow made it more frightening when tony took danny over the idea of <UNK> older self <UNK> back to his younger self isn't scary br br the woman in the shower scene done by <UNK> <UNK> about whom i can find no other credits for having done anything before or since as the younger woman and <UNK> gibson who also appears to suffer from a lack of credits for works before or since was <UNK> obnoxious and thoroughly disgusting it was dramatic and frightening <UNK> and scary when nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her <UNK> flesh beneath his hands the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and real br br jack quickly <UNK> on his trek from the <UNK> alcoholic to a <UNK> insane person the <UNK> of his character's mental state is carefully and thoroughly documented by kubrick jack's instant friendship with lloyd the bartender as only <UNK> would be mental patients and drug <UNK> do portrays his <UNK> need of the atmosphere to which lloyd <UNK> him namely alcohol hair of the dog that bit me jack <UNK> in jack's case it's <UNK> on the rocks at no charge to jack orders from the house lloyd the bartender nice play on words br br when wendy <UNK> jack's screenplay is nothing more than page after page of the same line <UNK> over and over albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles when he asks from the shadows how do you like it and wendy <UNK> and screams with the baseball bat in her hand is so poignant it's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is how messed up jack is it's very scary dramatic and delivers a strong presence that coupled with <UNK> visions of the hotel <UNK> filling with blood <UNK> over the scene between jack and wendy and with the <UNK> ending to this scene make this possibly the strongest scene of the movie br br the <UNK> scene wow what do i say what mother would not be totally freaked by awakening to find their young troubled son standing over them with a huge knife talking in that freaky little voice <UNK> <UNK> over and over even if it had no meaning it would still be as scary as the <UNK> level of hell it was something everyone could and has remember ed speaking of memorable scenes br br <UNK> final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history his ad <UNK> line <UNK> johnny was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror it also goes down in horror movie history br br the ending kubrick's ending was perfection i felt it ended beautifully no <UNK> no <UNK> whining no <UNK> idiotic ending for this movie just <UNK> perfection that's all i'll say on the subject of the ending br br who cares what was taken out look what kubrick put in rent it watch it buy it it's a classic in the horror genre and for good reason it <UNK> br br me being me take this movie and <UNK> it in your stephen king collection and take the 1997 <UNK> version done by king and stick it down in the kiddie section that's where it belongs this movie rates a 9 98 from the fiend
<START> i went into the straight story expecting a sad happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting these i got what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a <UNK> and turn it into a <UNK> for the human condition br br if you didn't notice watch it again paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets the <UNK> he's driving through the reactions people give him the kinds of discussions he has one of the first is about <UNK> and children one of the last is outside of a cemetery the last road he drives down is <UNK> haunting in this context as it <UNK> and his fear and <UNK> <UNK> the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death and the <UNK> <UNK> of his engine relating to an <UNK> in which he achieves the desired reunion br br i only hope some of the people who <UNK> this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more <UNK> attention
<START> this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon <UNK> play in a movie he is a singer not an actor what is he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire <UNK> <UNK> blade surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic <UNK> arrive only 4 vampires are left what happened with the other 10 15 vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon <UNK> blows her head with a shotgun that's really a not in buffy the vampire <UNK> in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality
<START> this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here there's an <UNK> amount of <UNK> with an inventive <UNK> of the baby <UNK> weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film making itself <UNK> than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointment br br that said there's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the <UNK> of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor <UNK> of the little boy who begins to stare into the <UNK> of death his father opened for him
<START> wait don't tell me they threw out the movie and kept the out takes you know this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york the gangster <UNK> i guess gangster rap designer gangster <UNK> clothes including the <UNK> which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust <UNK> to the head i guess it was to protect the head from the heat <UNK> through the k mart hats budget rent a <UNK> it seems <UNK> the <UNK> the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was <UNK> her words i though it was him talking you know watching this movie just <UNK> that it isn't about the acting anymore its about looks and it's about the money couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned well all in all i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made just one more thing though where was ice t did he finally get to go on oprah
<START> this is a low budget scream style movie <UNK> is a new worker at a <UNK> <UNK> office where she meets and starts a relationship with her co worker chris during a hot <UNK> party chris and his friends convince <UNK> they belong to a murder club where everyone has killed someone for kicks when <UNK> loses it and kills someone for real <UNK> ensue br br the film looks good and there are the <UNK> for this genre and budget level nudity gore maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast but after the credits roll you'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it
<START> this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles it is too far fetched and at some points ridiculous if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts which i might add are poorly done and wish you were some warrior to the casting in this movie wasn't very good and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all on a scale of 1 10 10 being excellent 1 being horrible the acting in this movie is a 4 brenda song is talented in comedy but with this kind of movie in some of the more serious scenes her acting was laughable when she made some of her fighting poses i started laughing out loud i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing for example the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is <UNK> how her voice turns dark and evil i think that was incredibly stupid and how <UNK> brenda song teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks that was pretty ridiculous to so to <UNK> it all a disappointing movie but okay if you're 10 or under
<START> ok first a <UNK> to the tag posted on this movie's main page <UNK> lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie nor did he stop at his sister's grave the individual in question is ann <UNK> who was a very close friend to lincoln in his new <UNK> days some say that ann was in fact <UNK> girlfriend but there is no evidence to support it br br now there are <UNK> and <UNK> in this film hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun and young mr lincoln is no exception however the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event the <UNK> of murder against william duff armstrong and even though it's largely <UNK> in this film with lots of name changes it will still have viewers <UNK> to the screen this is hollywood's golden age with drama at it's finest and henry fonda gives possibly the best lincoln played by anyone
<START> i saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema i had some hopes for the movie because i really like <UNK> the <UNK> and the book it's based on the movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting <UNK> characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for like <UNK> and terrible editing the movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long a messed up <UNK> that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped after suffering through the story you'll get treated to one of the worst endings i've seen in a very long it should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies it's hard to mention any good things about this movie about a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and i didn't hear a kind word after the movie was over avoid this movie at all costs it really destroyed any faith i had left in the dutch movie industry
<START> a great opportunity for and <UNK> director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john <UNK> traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche instead it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john <UNK> life with john <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> mother's hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself instead of focusing on john <UNK> musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life it showed <UNK> legacy to be that of a confused drug addicted soul who should looked upon as a god instead a man i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another crazy person obsessed with lennon <UNK> killer mark david <UNK> lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon do we need to be reminded of that john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was <UNK> to see another disturbed person as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon and not show his beautiful <UNK> to the world <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> memory by making the <UNK> in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects and remember john instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide i found this so disturbing and <UNK> to <UNK> memory he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death and to see such violence near this site felt like a <UNK> a terrible wound for any lennon fan it ruined the movie completely for me it could have been a decent movie but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth let john lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie
<START> i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one but when i started with it i found it really awful they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think 95 of the movie is shot in india you can see indian made cars you can see lars drinking <UNK> an indian water brand hindi written on the road you can also see <UNK> in afghanistan <UNK> its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time
<START> life stinks is a parody of life and death happiness and depression the black and the white always present in our lives mel brooks performance is brilliant as always and the other actors work is fine too this movie has some <UNK> flavor <UNK> why is so good br br there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street and all the people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul <UNK> and then start arguing and <UNK> each other br br if you <UNK> seen it you <UNK> know what <UNK> missed br br this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich br br the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality <UNK> br br yes indeed life stinks
<START> this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time when watching this movie your filled with action and when somethings not really <UNK> the humour is un matched brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are the contestants and a near future where the general public all have a <UNK> for blood also arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one liners i don't want to spoil anything for you but i will tell you when arnold gives his i'll be back line he gets the best response of them all in this movie hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did
<START> <UNK> is still a good surprise in italian cinema the film is based on a book of italian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who also directs the movie and writes the music score of course br br the film is a portrait of north italian <UNK> life in the <UNK> <UNK> region we're in 1975 the time of the first free <UNK> one of the boys of the movie creates <UNK> youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and <UNK> are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs <UNK> the main character is a victim of heroin slavery br br without being boring and <UNK> the story flows very well the <UNK> of actors is strong and the way of directing as well obviously <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is neither fellini nor a movie professional first of all he's a musician but he succeeds in making a good product unfortunately he'll not repeat the success with his second movie da zero a <UNK> not good at all br br in <UNK> actors are generally not very famous the only star is <UNK> <UNK> one of the most popular young italian actors see in a small role another italian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he's the nice communist <UNK> and football <UNK>
<START> i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time when i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic <UNK> of our <UNK> government it's a shame because <UNK> was been shooting nice movies when it was not <UNK> by the name of <UNK> <UNK> but it was actually ran by him the movies like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or even <UNK> <UNK> but after mr <UNK> death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced however in late 1980s <UNK> was shot it was a film about first <UNK> crime groups in the big country one year later mr <UNK> <UNK> shot another film with the co staring of the same actor singer v <UNK> at that time he was already a soviet russian rock legend the movie called <UNK> the <UNK> or something it was completely new somebody called that period as <UNK> or a new <UNK> movie wave unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products and again back to our <UNK> such movies usually <UNK> because of vast aspects the same effects was with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about russian <UNK> that was also shot on <UNK> with foreign partners i think they were french or maybe british <UNK> liked it even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like <UNK> imho
<START> criticism of the film evening based on the novel by susan <UNK> and adapted for the screen by <UNK> and michael cunningham has been harsh so harsh that it may have <UNK> many viewers from giving the film a try the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's <UNK> over a mistake she made one summer in her youth that famous actors were given very minor roles that the entire production was over hyped etc for this viewer seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home a very different reaction occurred br br ann grant lord vanessa redgrave is dying in her home by the ocean and her <UNK> and memories allow her to share a man's name <UNK> with her two grown daughters nina toni <UNK> and <UNK> natasha richardson as her daughters sit at her <UNK> ann <UNK> a particular summer when she was a <UNK> for her best friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a marriage both ann claire danes as the youthful ann and <UNK> alcoholic brother buddy hugh <UNK> <UNK> to feeling that <UNK> was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved harris <UNK> patrick wilson her <UNK> son who had become a <UNK> harris buddy <UNK> and ann are woven together in a series of <UNK> and romances that have been kept secret until now 50 years later as ann is dying the older <UNK> meryl streep visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed <UNK> are no such things as mistakes life just goes on ' the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by <UNK> and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons yes there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying <UNK> words such <UNK> are understandable the film is <UNK> by the presence of not only redgrave richardson <UNK> true daughter collette <UNK> <UNK> true daughter meryl streep claire danes <UNK> <UNK> glenn close hugh <UNK> and patrick wilson but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances the setting is gorgeous cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> and the musical score is by the <UNK> jan a p <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> being <UNK> directs judge this film on your own grady <UNK>
<START> best movie ever this movie broke my <UNK> just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it i don't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance i think you will either love it or hate it that's the qualities of a real cult movie
<START> this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice the directing and editing was great i may look up the book that this was adapted from it must have been great i liked it <UNK> weaver jon voight and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch henry <UNK> and nathan davis were not seen enough but were fun when they were <UNK> the kids at the camp couldn't have been better as i said i liked it
<START> this movie has a very simple yet clever premise an unemployed man trying to steal from a <UNK> store and the store clerk catches him in the act the thief runs away with the store clerk right after him all the while the store clerk is in trouble with a low rank <UNK> <UNK> gangster along the chase for the thief they catch the eye of the <UNK> who's been looking for the <UNK> store clerk the story then moves into high gear in the form of a tom jerry cat mouse but is added with the dog chasing after the cat the entire 2nd act of d a n g a n runner can be translate to english as <UNK> <UNK> is about the chase and the chase goes on on to the point that by the end of the 2nd act the bum forgets why he is running away and the <UNK> don't remember which of the 2 guys he is chasing nor does he remember why they're running away from him br br similar to <UNK> later film <UNK> blues the bulk of the film is simply all chase and action with plenty of physical comedy and dark humor <UNK> to keep the audience engaged what falls short is the ending to which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam and into one of the most chaotic mexican stand offs you'll see on film that looks almost as if <UNK> was paying homage to tony scott's true romance written by quentin tarantino
<START> i watch movies for a living picking out which ones are good enough to <UNK> <UNK> aside those that don't make the cut i'm not saying that i know more than anyone else based on this i'm just leading you to how i came to watch the <UNK> of lou anyways so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them i don't actually watch everything usually i just look over at the tv occasionally while i'm working the <UNK> for production value performance and how well the story is being presented if something catches my eye i'll take the time to watch it lou drew me in during the first few minutes where i closed my <UNK> and <UNK> my chair over to the tv so i could completely tune in needless to say i was enthralled throughout the whole movie the story is told well the characters are either endearing or repulsive depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character and all very well played at times i caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss i've heard other people's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes other time extreme <UNK> i was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie sadly i was unable to <UNK> it because i was as the saying goes a week late and a dollar short that's the way it goes sometimes but at least i had the pleasure of seeing this one and i can't wait to see what kind of response it gets good luck and great fortune to you <UNK> <UNK> if you read this you are without a doubt a talent to watch for
<START> we have a lake we have an animated meteor crashing we have a killer stop motion dinosaur with <UNK> okay so let's call this movie the <UNK> lake monster what else can we add hmm two idiots called arnie mitch to define the ultimate definition of comic relief we also got to have a sheriff who doesn't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody <UNK> to <UNK> crap we're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy no <UNK> let's introduce some guy with a <UNK> have him rob a store to indicate he's a bad guy then have him pop up somewhere near the lake have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur <UNK> food that should work br br a complete clumsy mess this film its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you the first film to feature dave allen as a stop motion <UNK> after this one he joined forces with charles band for several years until the the mid nineties when band ran out of money to pay him i guess the dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny unfortunately that's about the only good thing that can be said for it br br good badness yes the mind <UNK> logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list if not arnie mitch will do the trick 3 10 and 8 10
<START> brian <UNK> bill paxton joe <UNK> and best of all jeff <UNK> all in one film wow is all i can think to say about that these are four of the most underrated actors in the <UNK> and they work beautifully together it's like poetry the way they play off each other and <UNK> the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for <UNK> for even shooting the film br br the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time and the four stars help the re watch ability to a great extent i cannot describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff <UNK> together on screen the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the <UNK> themselves it almost brought a tear to my eyes br br a good film a great cast go see why four words <UNK> <UNK> paxton <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> you guys need to understand how hard it <UNK> unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of the <UNK> have not been discovered for a tiny idea pop like 50 hits of e watch death factory while on the phone with jesus wait jesus is on call waiting you're having phone sex with will smith on the primary line seriously that movie so good you need to watch it at least a 4 times to catch all the subtleties well not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie times 4 in order to <UNK> why the people at full moon are allowed to a live and b <UNK> what is our world coming to
<START> directed and co written by <UNK> fox the writer director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature <UNK> jagger 2002 this <UNK> epic at <UNK> <UNK> minutes is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life <UNK> especially urban gay men like myself need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with <UNK> br br while <UNK> jagger focused on a pair of gay lovers in the <UNK> confines of israeli military service ha <UNK> is <UNK> on a group of <UNK> friends both straight and gay who share a unit in the heart of <UNK> generally gay <UNK> but not always gay friendly capital tel <UNK> br br ha <UNK> opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which noam <UNK> <UNK>  <UNK> from <UNK> jagger first meets handsome young arab <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> romance soon <UNK>  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be <UNK> quickly or lost altogether br br from there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the <UNK> and the <UNK> effect of <UNK> very conservative family if you follow this film's dialogue <UNK> enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending br br the soundtrack for ha <UNK> is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i e real life in the middle east br br the english subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad <UNK> who can make you feel sick very embarrassing <UNK> had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which <UNK> was looking for paul <UNK> <UNK> around <UNK> the commercial was about a <UNK> <UNK> cd collection br br this little movie is like a <UNK> commercial bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the <UNK> theater poor oscar br br <UNK> could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this 7 35 a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men
<START> this movie was absolutely wonderful the pre <UNK> time and culture has been <UNK> beautifully <UNK> has given yet another brilliant performance what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesn't resort to <UNK> bashing that is running rampant in movies like <UNK> and <UNK> with the <UNK> as a backdrop the movie does not <UNK> to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong the movie always centers around the tragic story of <UNK> life her fragile relationship with <UNK> <UNK> has been depicted excellently the movie actually shows how the people both <UNK> and muslims have suffered from this <UNK> the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film
<START> slow and <UNK> with <UNK> over looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the <UNK> during the texas fight for independence from mexico james <UNK> as jim <UNK> brian keith as <UNK> <UNK> alec baldwin as <UNK> travis <UNK> julia as general santa anna this made for tv project also stars david <UNK> <UNK> kathleen york and jim <UNK> very good original music by peter <UNK>
<START> i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts instead we get 8 great leads that take us through <UNK> golden episodes of anime bliss br br it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months years and then go back to and <UNK> new meaning from a masterpiece in script writing even though it has the typical anime <UNK> of there being a <UNK> between subtitles and english dub it has an abundance of concepts and <UNK> that make you think about your own views br br the relationships between the cold <UNK> males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> to watch the apparent <UNK> of the male is <UNK> with an inner turmoil that makes the love a word never mentioned in the series of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely if at all see which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic it takes <UNK> all of the <UNK> episodes to show some caring but he gets there and when he does its a big pay off br br and then there's the giant robot fighting fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene any less <UNK> up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends but they're wrong many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a <UNK> dose of pathos usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs <UNK> br br the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring it is a captivating thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body
<START> i feel this is one of the best movies i've seen i'm an older male and love most westerns i love movies based in part at least on facts if i am not mistaken this is such a movie i also like revenge type movies this qualifies there as well in my opinion some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the <UNK> and the <UNK> shooting scene i felt the <UNK> beating scene was a little <UNK> but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie i saw what i think is a <UNK> of this movie in a gun smoke episode i also enjoyed that i recommend taking the time to watch this movie i will watch it again i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type but i always enjoy his acting
<START> once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing
<START> actually that video camera effect is just that it's an effect a rather good one u don't know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original it's great fun to watch made for tv doesn't need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are <UNK> for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and he's more realistic he doesn't just <UNK> chop people up like in other horrors
<START> this is essentially a variation on house of wax in both the plot and the type of role played by the star of both movies vincent price in both pictures he plays a talented artist who is sent <UNK> over the edge into insanity when his creations are <UNK> by other less talented and less <UNK> people in this movie he plays a designer of <UNK> for stage <UNK> who <UNK> to set out on a performing career himself only to be frustrated when another <UNK> the great <UNK> john <UNK> insists that he honour his contract and give him first choice of any <UNK> he designs price is already ill <UNK> towards <UNK> as his former wife is now a <UNK> of <UNK> he <UNK> his talents as an <UNK> and as a brilliant <UNK> to avenge himself upon <UNK> and others who <UNK> his plans for recognition as a performer and a designer br br price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well judged star turn as a <UNK> man whose <UNK> earns audience sympathy the rest of the cast are competent if <UNK> and the weight of the whole venture falls on price who carries the burden with ease br br good solid b movie melodrama this is a crime movie rather than a horror picture and is enjoyable providing you don't expect a masterpiece shot in black and white it is low on gore and is best seen as melodrama and enjoyed for the presence of its star giving an <UNK> performance
<START> one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellence br br the plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesn't <UNK> i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own <UNK> and beliefs on what happens after our demise
<START> excellent show instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it's the same old thing just different stars this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations we have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w shame on global for pulling the plug on this one i thought this one would be a winner let's be realistic about things few canadian shows make it everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise don't get me wrong i enjoy a lot of shows on tv but come on people let's keep the variety this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you don't see on any sitcoms today or in the past too bad that global had to say no to this one foolish mistake
<START> on the <UNK> day god created georges but the same as an <UNK> day doesn't fit into the week georges doesn't fit into the modern world he has down syndrome and is therefore <UNK> by society <UNK> off to an asylum after his mother's death four years ago she was the only one who loved him br br harry is another man that isn't loved anymore his wife has left him for reasons that she is unable to explain he loses the love of his daughters too when he arrives too late at the <UNK> station to collect the two kids who wanted to spend the weekend with their father br br harry is a highly <UNK> businessman he knows all the rules that <UNK> us to succeed in our modern <UNK> but he has entered a state of crisis which reaches a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters he questions the sense of his life without <UNK> any definite results br br harry and georges meet at first harry tries to get rid of georges the same as all the others do but georges can't be <UNK> off and it gradually <UNK> on harry how much he needs georges if he wants to get over his identity crisis it is georges who opens a new access to the world for him and who makes him view his life with different eyes friendship and human warmth take the place of <UNK> <UNK> for success it is no surprise that harry now cannot avoid failing in his job br br georges helps harry to regain the recognition of the daughters even his wife has to admit that the fireworks which he organized were worth seeing nonetheless a <UNK> into the old life is no longer possible and the new one turns out to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit which <UNK> will reach its end the camera watches harry and georges from above for one long minute as they are both lying down in the grass just <UNK> the moment but the same as this minute will <UNK> go by the friendship of the two men which came into being in such a wondrous fashion will not be long lasting georges is destroyed by the <UNK> of love to the opposite sex and can see no other way out but to commit suicide harry turns into a city tramp who asks the car drivers that are waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity br br the movie describes modern <UNK> as a disastrous <UNK> which <UNK> positive values such as human <UNK> or friendship it is georges the <UNK> who seems to be capable of showing the way out of the dilemma but unfortunately his <UNK> comes to a bad end however his failure does not necessarily have to mean that it is impossible or not <UNK> to reach the <UNK> goal the way he shows us is surely passable although it requires a huge amount of <UNK> and above all the courage to apply a radical <UNK>
<START> normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time <UNK> effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time
<START> sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful <UNK> anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real <UNK> it's an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood there's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep <UNK> wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
<START> bob <UNK> <UNK> poor <UNK> is a so so cartoon populated by appalling <UNK> and one or two nice moments set in <UNK> fish <UNK> <UNK> poor <UNK> <UNK> an uncomfortable area between a standard black <UNK> white <UNK> cartoon and one of the books come to life <UNK> <UNK> that were popular at that time typically of many of the early <UNK> cartoons <UNK> is far from the star appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film for the rest of the time the star is a <UNK> cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he <UNK> for unfortunately the audience gets far less than they <UNK> for as was sometimes the case in the books come to life series the spotlight is thrown on <UNK> signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium laughs are <UNK> and while the cartoon is just about saved by <UNK> energetic direction there is very little at all to recommend <UNK> poor <UNK> over any of the other below par early <UNK> cartoons
<START> no hidden agenda pure scifi all fun br br i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid br br the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen bullet is by far the better and only version anyone should see br br the movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own <UNK> 10 10 br br <UNK>
<START> first i'll give my rating for the series overall 7 out of ten stars i've taken away three for the downhill slide this series suffered after john <UNK> <UNK> don't get me wrong there were hard hitting episodes later but only after esther <UNK> left for a season and returned br br in <UNK> of 1974 a really great sit com with dramatic overtones premiered on cbs it was a tv first a show about an african american family living in the chicago projects in the 1970s created by norman <UNK> as a spin off of <UNK> he once again struck the right <UNK> with viewers br br not since this show have i seen a situation comedy directly talk about the struggles of inner city families well there was <UNK> south central in <UNK> but was not <UNK> br br john <UNK> as james evans sr was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted as any father should to keep his family together and his kids from going down the wrong paths in life br br esther <UNK> was a wonderful no non sense mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to their kids upbringing br br ralph carter as michael a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that doesn't meet his academic needs his character's name is the same as the show's <UNK> mike evans who was lionel <UNK> on the <UNK> mike evans passed away <UNK> 2006 br br thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto <UNK> walker as j j evans jr is the typical young wise cracking <UNK> kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough br br simply put all my favorite episodes are with john <UNK> with the exception of the penny gordon janet jackson story lines br br after the demise of the james evans character the show lost it's <UNK> and viewers <UNK> esther <UNK> left for an entire year not wanting to play second <UNK> to <UNK> smart <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br she returned the next season after <UNK> a guarantee that the writer's would even things out <UNK> neighbor <UNK> woods was a divorced woman who ended up <UNK> an abused little girl penny gordon played by a then 10 year old janet jackson <UNK> abusive mother was played by <UNK> fields kim <UNK> mother br br in august of 1979 the show came to an end with all leaving the projects for a better life <UNK> the artist had sold an idea to a comic book company michael went off to live on campus at college br br <UNK> penny thelma football player husband keith florida all moved into the same building in <UNK> chicago not the most realistic ending but by that time it didn't matter
<START> <UNK> spoilers within this great movie is about so many things all of them successfully sci fi time travel unstable <UNK> <UNK> society the what is real syndrome <UNK> <UNK> of belief systems worldwide <UNK> and a <UNK> love story br br the <UNK> of the story's twisted time line stir up loads of <UNK> debate witness the discussions within this site or as an extreme check out the <UNK> at www <UNK> net time monkeys <UNK> <UNK> such <UNK> emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples not to mention the inspiration of chris <UNK> la <UNK> without a doubt this is one of the most successful fascinating time travel movies ever conceived but there are many other levels speaking here br br the movie's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the mind of james cole bruce willis doing the best work of his career here his journey progresses from <UNK> ho <UNK> hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again the other broad <UNK> of the story increasingly <UNK> the personal tale between james and dr kathryn <UNK> the wonderful madeleine <UNK> i love the <UNK> shifting <UNK> <UNK> of these two characters for me it all comes to a head in the <UNK> hotel room scene by this point james  once <UNK> by an <UNK> determination  now <UNK> in utter doubt about his own reality while dr <UNK>  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced after absorbing <UNK> <UNK> of his horrific <UNK> her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she's come br br gilliam makes us care about these characters especially through the <UNK> of tension <UNK> their lives the balance held between emotional roller coaster and <UNK> sci fi puzzle thriller is exquisite and the denouement at the airport is heart <UNK> intense because we see it coming so clearly through <UNK> dreams it is here just after james has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind see jose and the <UNK> just before this the references to hitchcock's vertigo and identity switching confusion are brilliant this is a movie to be <UNK> out between thinking people it not only holds up under repeated viewings it demands them twelve monkeys is intelligent provocative bizarre funny and suspenseful stuff br br the supporting cast is excellent especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> crazed and spoiled but ever the survivor and there is david morse as dr peters interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation and christopher plummer as dr <UNK> but the biggest <UNK> belong to terry gilliam <UNK> here just barely his outstanding brazil lots of parallels of course especially the lonely <UNK> trying to escape his <UNK> surroundings <UNK> within <UNK> without every frame of this movie has his unique <UNK> and tone the soundtrack is terrific too br br this is one of the great achievements of the 90s a true favorite of mine and sure to hold up for a long time to come
<START> this is a really cool movie i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a week shadow was my favorite character in the movie <UNK> bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things parts of the movie are sad though such as when sassy the cat falls down the <UNK> and when shadow falls in the hole at the end i have seen the second <UNK> bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first shadow is the smart one sassy is well sassy and chance is the funny idiot i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals this is one of my top ten favorite movies
<START> a girl is <UNK> <UNK> that a serial rapist is staring at her through the <UNK> detectives martin manners and <UNK> stone is hot on his trail but not hot enough as they find him after he kills rapes and eats a <UNK> of the girl he's the shot to death one would hope that this would be the end of the film not because it's too horrifying but because the level of acting is <UNK> horrid sadly it's not the end and months later the rapist is <UNK> as a zombie by a <UNK> of <UNK> so he continues where he left off with the detectives on the case again this time a flying baby is after him too don't ask there has been very good very low budget movies street trash and filthy <UNK> spring to mind but this one is <UNK> the bottom of the barrel horrible acting crappy dime store special effects lame attempt at comedy and oh yeah and the ending sucks too br br my grade f br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> gets fully nude anne r key gets topless
<START> ok the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of <UNK> top sights otherwise production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week ellen <UNK> was charming and fun to watch <UNK> folk had the most depth and was very effective and william baldwin was well william baldwin he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running jumping earnest action figure the rest of the cast was wooden at best but mostly paper so if you're nostalgic about spain it's a picture <UNK> with an action twist and a healthy dose of el <UNK> if not skip it
<START> okay i had heard little about this film so when it came on the movie channels on tv i wanted to watch it being a horror <UNK> i think i can do a collective huh for everyone who watched it br br i decided to move on with my life but at a party with my closest friends we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it both of us <UNK> this is the dumbest thing i've ever seen it wasn't scary ill give it to roth who i think is a young hack characters do change throughout the film ala cube br br however despite your typical rats in a cage scenario who will turn on who etc it was pretty average horror br br a few points 1 what was with that kid i'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people i'm talking about the whole slow motion karate kicking what was that 2 okay i know <UNK> character liked jordan <UNK> but as a young woman i was appalled that he just went ahead and <UNK> her in her sleep uh thats illegal br br 3 roth was in the movie just so roth could be in the movie talk about <UNK> writing yourself in 4 what was with the deputy 5 so she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog and there was little to no blood left just a <UNK> of her <UNK> anyway we were laughing our <UNK> off and i love laughing during horror movies return of the living dead 2 evil dead but i don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here
<START> i can't quite say that jerry springer <UNK> is the worst film i have ever seen the film would be better off if it were because at least the worst film i've ever seen prom night ii interested me enough for me to hate it my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed it had seemed much more like years it is an endless <UNK> of poor people or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are <UNK> each other hitting each other insulting each other and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when <UNK> the plot which covers how a group of stupid people <UNK> their lives badly enough to provide <UNK> for the jerry springer mill advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters this makes it impossible to care what happens to them it never <UNK> to me whether they got on the show or what they said or who slept with whom maybe i'm not supposed to care about them maybe i'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type to see their outrageous behavior as <UNK> funny too bad it isn't the humor is not outrageous it's <UNK> it's predictable humor has to have something behind it some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function <UNK> is not wit an example a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed to take revenge she <UNK> across the trailer park and gives <UNK> sex to her daughter's boyfriend since i was over the shock of jerry <UNK> show a long time ago i had the same reaction i had to andrew <UNK> <UNK> obscene <UNK> <UNK> not laughter just <UNK> lastly i found <UNK> pose as a <UNK> tiresome and unconvincing if he really were an <UNK> of the poor he would bring on a single mom from bed <UNK> to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on 12 000 a year or failing that he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his <UNK> jerry springer gets millions for his shows his movie his book and videos his guests just get round trip air fare hotel <UNK> and a chance to <UNK> themselves if he liked poor people so much he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some <UNK> for himself <UNK> with all his fine work you'd think he'd have earned our respect already anyway the film is weak and boring it doesn't even succeed at being offensive if you want to have a better evening <UNK> a bug <UNK> for a night and then watch that
<START> normally i try to avoid sci fi movies as much as i can because this just isn't a genre that really appeals to me light <UNK> <UNK> aliens time traveling most of the time it's nothing for me however there is one movie in the genre that i'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this twelve monkeys i remember to be completely blown away by it the first time but even now after having it seen several times already i'm still one of its biggest fans every time i see it this movie seems to get better and better br br somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996 leaving only 1 percent of the population alive james cole is one of them he's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a <UNK> to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the <UNK> they believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'the twelve <UNK> and need the virus before it mutated so that scientists can study it but their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990 where he meets dr kathryn <UNK> a psychiatrist and jeffrey <UNK> the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert br br what i like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not is this just an illusion created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time was the population really wiped out by a virus released by the army of the twelve monkeys those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end if the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious i'm sure that i would never have liked it as much as i did now it's just that <UNK> that keeps me interested time after time but that's not the only good thing about this movie of course the acting is amazing too normally i'm not too much a fan of bruce willis but what he did in this movie was just astonishing together with madeleine <UNK> and brad pitt he should have won several awards for it because together with the amazing story they made this movie work so incredibly well br br even after several viewings i'm still a huge fan of this movie except for this movie i have only seen one other terry gilliam movie and that's fear and loathing in las vegas which wasn't bad but didn't really convince me either however it's this movie that really makes me look forward to his other work i give it a 9 10 maybe even a 9 5 10
