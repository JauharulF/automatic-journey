<START> a clever overall story location for a story action is respectable the children are annoying and their motivation is unclear the leading villain was a nice change but could have been better i love you was more <UNK> than you complete me but at least van damme got a chance to show a little <UNK> one of van <UNK> better movies
<START> this movie started out cringe worthy but it was meant to with an overbearing mother a witch of a rival and a <UNK> beauty queen constantly coming in second there was some goofy overacting and a few implausible plot points she comes in second in every single competition all of them unfortunately the movie suffers horribly from it's need to well be a tv movie rather than end at the ending of the movie an amusing twist in which the killer is semi <UNK> revealed the movie continues for another twenty minutes just to make sure that justice is done of course now that the killer is revealed she suddenly <UNK> a complete personality shift her character gets completely <UNK> because the writers don't need to keep her identity secret any more the cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a <UNK> amusing movie
<START> the <UNK> miniseries opens with a <UNK> montage of action sequences the <UNK> quickly <UNK> that these are the best scenes out of the minute running time and they're not good not good at all oh dear br br but let us not judge a book by its cover even though that's exactly what we're being invited to do let's give <UNK> a chance to redeem itself br br well here's the expected <UNK> opening on but who's this <UNK> strangely ugly man paul <UNK> this is paul <UNK> this generic plastic puppet and why does he look so old what's that the actor's only 25 well he doesn't look it and that's way too old anyway br br but at least he has charisma right wrong alec newman is a stumbling <UNK> <UNK> i'm <UNK> him being discovered sitting in the dark in a <UNK> acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over and he's just too dumb to realise it when your paul <UNK> has all the screen <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and an acting range from <UNK> to blank your production of <UNK> is doomed from the start br br the other actors take pity on poor alec though and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn't look too bad by comparison at least i assume that is what they are doing because i'm <UNK> you see br br to be fair they are clearly being given no direction at all random gestures blank or inconsistent <UNK> missing their marks it's all here this is like a master class in how not to do it br br and sure there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie but there aren't twice as many because of all the pauses to fill time br br but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of 20 million or only 5 million per hour nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget br br except perhaps stargate sg 1 which makes do with 1 4 million per 50 minute episode or <UNK> at 2 million and frankly i'd rather watch four episodes of either of those while being <UNK> in the <UNK> than have to sit though the travesty that is <UNK> the miniseries again
<START> yes let's get this out of the way before we begin this is the one that sean connery returned to in 1983 after the <UNK> we had of roger moore it's <UNK> last film and yes it's a kind of remake of <UNK> but more of a film inspired by it if all you bond <UNK> out there think i'm gonna get controversial you're right bond is one of the greatest movie series ever but that doesn't mean that a series should go on forever this i think is one of two films where they could've done themselves a huge favour and ended the bond saga not offended yet then i'll continue hey if you're thinking i'm indifferent about bond flicks you're wrong i grew up with my mum being obsessed with them any spare moment bond and his antics would be on the tv bond rules and <UNK> say never <UNK> directed by <UNK> strikes <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best it may not be <UNK> or <UNK> russia ' and may not have been done by the same production house as all the others which i hear is why they refuse to accept it was ever made but still stands head and shoulders above the recent brosnan <UNK> if you haven't <UNK> at the screen read on characterization something so many blockbuster films forget about these days but something which is essential to telling a good story played a superb hand by treating <UNK> like he had been <UNK> since <UNK> <UNK> he's <UNK> on a and so has to do things like go to a health farm a direct order from <UNK> yeah if you haven't seen this film i won't give too much away with the plot because a loads happens and b obviously i want you to see it for yourselves don't be put off by my <UNK> revelation connery still get plenty of superb set pieces to charge swim punch speed smash and <UNK> his way through the man is a legend and this film is one of his most enjoyable <UNK> as bond high tech <UNK> <UNK> some great villains and an excellent supporting cast including a fantastic cameo by <UNK> <UNK> lift this movie high above audience expectation br br this could've been the last bond film ever and it would've been a party to remember playing the secret agent as someone <UNK> retirement was refreshing stroke of genius the last scene <UNK> things up perfectly for the series but still we had more and then more and more still and one more moore still if you fancy finding out what <UNK> is all about get this film then you can at least pretend <UNK> spent his last moments as a <UNK> secret agent in the arms of kim basinger and <UNK> at mr bean p s that other film that i think could've finished it all off the gritty to <UNK>
<START> what often gets overlooked in agatha <UNK> stories is her <UNK> anti conservative attitude on a number of issues from the role of women to the effects of tradition to people's belief in the supernatural in nemesis you can spot a lot of those <UNK> but you can also find a good old fashioned intriguing mystery that keeps you in the dark for most of its length also <UNK> nemesis above other series entries they do it with mirrors 4 50 from etc is the fact that in the crucial moments before and after the revelation of the killer you can actually feel the suspense and finally jane booker is welcome to guard my body any time
<START> i started off being interested somewhat in the movie it appeared it might be serious drama dealing with death grief and healing with some realistic human conflict thrown in alas it didn't hold up br br i need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely <UNK> and inconsistent look i know this was not supposed to be shakespeare but come on i need some quality in script and characterization br br the acting was alright the writing not so much at one point james <UNK> character is <UNK> for showing up at a <UNK> under dressed he states that <UNK> him around will not work his new wife says that if he goes home and changes she will rip his clothes off later that is a <UNK> this movie had a few unintentionally funny lines br br it was hard to care about <UNK> <UNK> character when he so readily gave his first wife's things to his new wife even allowing his daughter to be <UNK> i lost most of my sympathy who really cares what happens to him i must confess that i did not finish the movie if it did a <UNK> in quality in the last 45 minutes let me know it was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable i felt there was no need to finish it
<START> one of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the <UNK> of others <UNK> a <UNK> or <UNK> factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their <UNK> a new diamond <UNK> another worst thing is to totally <UNK> the true facts of an incredible saga by events dialog and images to the director's own liking lastly one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom of the barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day all three of these the makers of this film are guilty of this is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen thousands a score of <UNK> is too good for this waste of celluloid not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it they should be ashamed for <UNK> <UNK> the heroes of this story which are the people who experienced this tragedy <UNK> both the living and the dead
<START> k <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made the much better in 1998 this film is an awful remake of the wedding singer br br basically in short the film consists of salman khan who in those days used to have the role of a <UNK> lover who <UNK> his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he <UNK> badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also <UNK> his shirt in scenes br br jackie wasted bored and tired his role is so stupid he is shown as a lover of <UNK> then in 1 scene he is shown as a <UNK> br br <UNK> kumar confusing characterization again br br <UNK> <UNK> boring overweight and does nothing special <UNK> tall fair and actress worthy but lacks talent br br shah says a <UNK> as if a poetry br br <UNK> poor fellow the 2 kids were awful too br br the story is the same and has awful comic scenes a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of <UNK> kapoor br br direction is poor music is decent br br salman khan just goes through the motions jackie is bad <UNK> is as usual <UNK> is bad and are nothing great <UNK> is awful
<START> this is by far the worst ever <UNK> movie no make that any movie i have ever watched shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap i never ask for a <UNK> on any movie but i think this will be a first br br the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it br br i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping br br the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster
<START> i can't get over the quality of the score the book and the performances this is the first production i've ever seen of <UNK> todd so i have no others to compare it to but the impact is so strong i just can't imagine anything better br br first there's the music take <UNK> act ii during which <UNK> anthony and <UNK> sing an <UNK> vocal line <UNK> the <UNK> from three songs it's like a bach in that sense just a masterpiece of composition and the underlying <UNK> structure and are so perfect a little bit of melancholy a little bit of <UNK> a little bit of yearning all expressing these three points of view br br then the lyrics the <UNK> are so clever the rhyme schemes sometimes seem random but they always add up at the end the dvd which i watched has closed <UNK> and these are <UNK> for <UNK> the dialog and the lyrics <UNK> deserves a literary award for his poetry alone br br finally the performances i can't imagine anyone better than george why haven't i heard of him before his singing alone is masterful but the range of his acting is simply amazing angela lansbury totally surprised me the song about you and me down by the <UNK> who could do it any better her timing is flawless pitch is perfect every beat of the score is <UNK> for and this achievement in <UNK> is her utterly delightful comic delivery br br it's a dark tale but i found it to be sweet at times and the tune to <UNK> continues to play in my head
<START> this is one dreary <UNK> self important bore when the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging you know the venture is <UNK> philip seymour hoffman plays truman capote as a <UNK> <UNK> ridden self indulgent cartoon voiced <UNK> like caricature why he is this way is never explained and we get <UNK> background information the script focuses on <UNK> writing of <UNK> cold <UNK> and his <UNK> to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four the acclaimed writer of <UNK> kill a <UNK> <UNK> lee catherine <UNK> <UNK> capote in his initial <UNK> into the crime and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic unfortunately lee is quickly <UNK> in favor of endless scenes of capote <UNK> his <UNK> existence watching him is like watching dr smith from <UNK> in <UNK> complain about his delicate back to anybody who will listen for two hours the difference however is that smith was fun to watch while capote is not the film's precious self importance kills it as does director bennett <UNK> <UNK> to add any kind of <UNK> like the <UNK> piano score the film is a one note wonder providing no contrast no emotional <UNK> and no intimate drama if capote really was this irritating why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it though the supporting roles are well performed chris cooper is his usual <UNK> self they serve such little dramatic purpose because ultimately it's all about capote director bennett and screenwriter dan <UNK> fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural <UNK> of <UNK> legend their product is <UNK> oscar bait and is more evidence that one great genre <UNK> has more truth in it than a dozen <UNK> of oh so sincere crap like this
<START> the film's executive producer is none other than that <UNK> of peace thru <UNK> <UNK> david lynch the director's father i wonder what david's guru his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would have thought of this production the <UNK> here is as <UNK> as is the film itself it's a safe bet that samuel l phoenix serial killer and <UNK> of <UNK> violence would have loved every minute of it br br i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft on that level it's quite good but on a moral level it's the most <UNK> movie i've ever seen br br spoiler coming br br i guess it's the <UNK> of the thing that <UNK> me the most morally <UNK> generation learn a craft and a little post modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts and entertainment industry and here's the result a film which <UNK> in human suffering injustice and carnage much of which is witnessed by a nine year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of <UNK> violence killers who at the end ride off into the sunset br br no more spoilers coming br br for whom are films like this produced <UNK> are going to adore this why wouldn't they but who else as i noted above there's some really good film craft here but good craft can be applied to any subject matter why apply it to stuff like this also the movie is very suspenseful but that's not because of the <UNK> of the violence it's suspenseful because it's well directed well acted i'm sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i can br br so what has been put before us here and above all why br br yes our world can be an ugly dirty even evil place but shouldn't we <UNK> when an artist makes it her his business to rub our faces in it or worse still to stick it in the faces of those nine year olds who will one way or another end up seeing this on home dvd br br i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids yeah i know dream on
<START> i'm amazed that <UNK> which is an excellent flick is so well regarded in the top 250 and this one doesn't even appear what the hell is that to be honest when this movie ended my <UNK> jerk reaction was that this movie is better than <UNK> after the <UNK> of the fabulous ending wore off i <UNK> that they are equal in their excellence i am just confused about why its not in the top 50 along with <UNK> i'm going to venture a guess that sadly it's because it's in black and white or because again sadly that the characters all have british accents sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this br br i'm telling you that if you loved <UNK> you will love following as well brilliant
<START> this is a great movie i read the brief synopsis and was <UNK> but as i watched it mainly for caroline it grew on me br br it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls young women are not <UNK> for their sexuality the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous <UNK> br br some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes which were not over the top or <UNK> the male characters in the movie were brilliant david <UNK> was great as the <UNK> hunk and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much the other two younger male characters were good too without being overbearing br br this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite <UNK> to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them
<START> the movie blood and chocolate is nothing like the book the plot has totally changed and whoever chose the cast needed to read the book first the girl is not an <UNK> <UNK> is vivian was the one that chased <UNK> her mother was to have survived and be the one after gabriel <UNK> was the one that did all the murders along with <UNK> an ex of gabriel is not old he is old looking and <UNK> did not get vivian in the end gabriel did the title came from vivian comparing kisses from <UNK> sweet like chocolate and gabriel delicious like blood she picked blood because it promised more and he understood her more that reminds me gabriel is not against humans like in the movie he just avoids <UNK> with them because they hurt him in the past really the book is <UNK> much better than the movie but if you want o see running a dating montage and a lot of jumping then this is the movie to see
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but the rest of this movie just does not work it's like a <UNK> <UNK> mold <UNK> interesting idea but who ever thought it would actually work on film i like director <UNK> two previous films they were mercilessly honest and <UNK> funny this film manages only to be <UNK> and chilling with <UNK> <UNK> of the as high concept think the doris day rock hudson movie sam <UNK> might have made now <UNK> your expectations to match the present mass produced state of hollywood that actors as talented as freeman kinnear vince and almost make their scenes come alive is a testament to the <UNK> of their talents to rise above material that just does not <UNK> i would have found <UNK> corny feel good about yourself speech at the end of the movie funny in a way if it weren't for the <UNK> suspicion that this <UNK> tacked on moral is meant to be accepted seriously
<START> in this dream come true i found myself loving what was going on it's a good movie and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie it's too smart for that it's definitely a feel good movie but with a nice message to leave you with 7 10 b 1 2 out of
<START> french cinema had always been very strong when comes the time to present historical subjects 95 of the time they never make errors this film is of one of the best of the genre due to very very strong acting by depardieu and work as the director is truly a wonder everyone should see this great film
<START> <UNK> journalist holly hunter produces <UNK> news reports for a major news network she's a <UNK> mouthed maverick <UNK> good at her job and with little time for romantic relationships enter william hurt and albert brooks two men who <UNK> for her love br br brooks is an old school journalist who <UNK> holly because she represents everything good about <UNK> they both believe that the media exists to test the gods <UNK> the public and fight for truth children of the sixties they <UNK> hippie values they're <UNK> of the public good knights who fight <UNK> with pen and camera br br william hurt in contrast is a far more complex character initially awkward clumsy and self <UNK> he gradually reveals himself to be a sexy and manipulative high skilled at climbing the corporate ladder unlike holly and brooks he's symbolic of modern media values news as spectacle <UNK> as entertainment news anchor as celebrity truth as subject to editing board we want to despise him and his <UNK> time junk food <UNK> but we just can't quite manage it he's playing the game by its own rules do we <UNK> him for lacking a moral <UNK> do we <UNK> the game can the game exist if its rules are <UNK> how have these rules evolved br br this isn't <UNK> and network and so the film never bothers to answer or raise these questions content to keep things on the level of light comedy it ends with hurt being promoted to london division and brooks being <UNK> to a tiny community network holly having rejected both men remains caught between them the last <UNK> of media integrity this <UNK> reporter remembers her roots <UNK> the loss of brooks and warns herself to be on the guard of future william hurts br br it's a cute ending but compared to network the film seems positively trite vision is one in which global media despite its offers less meaningful information he <UNK> a world in which <UNK> has <UNK> cultures information has become subject to and a handful of media <UNK> control all international news this is a world in which the truth is subject to <UNK> and economic interests a world in which viewer ratings determine content and opinion <UNK> <UNK> top stories br br perhaps this is why broadcast news which <UNK> for the glory days of <UNK> ends on such a bittersweet note it knows what the future holds made in 1987 its been living it for at least a decade br br but today in the digital age things are even worse and have left a very small number of massive <UNK> <UNK> the communication landscape with this has come the hyper <UNK> of content the <UNK> between the creative <UNK> side and the commercial side all but <UNK> today everyone might be able to start their own <UNK> or website but these are grass roots affairs as the communication reach of the individual <UNK> due to technological progress email internet electricity air mail etc the size of the <UNK> world <UNK> likewise he must project his voice both further and <UNK> <UNK> battling that <UNK> white noise the <UNK> verbal static that is the global community br br so ultimately you need two things according to <UNK> theory firstly you need a <UNK> coming of people in power and people who want to be in power both in the private and public <UNK> secondly you need a wide range of informed opinions on all important issues of the day in a <UNK> society the media system as a whole should produce this sort of culture unfortunately the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> society br br 8 10  this is lightweight stuff but a witty script some funny moments and a brief cameo by jack nicholson elevate it above most other films about <UNK> interestingly unlike most films about the media it never <UNK> into satire and instead plays things as a straight love triangle br br worth one viewing
<START> it has started quietly if your are looking for an action packed movie this is absolutely not the right choice all characters are slowly depicted on the scene stroke after stroke on the scene <UNK> none can take away his hands to the priest and so the sisters <UNK> devotion can only remain into the village <UNK> and <UNK> know their destiny belong only to the village so when you understand that you are on the movie scene in the village that becomes the whole known world in that time when no technology can let you imagine anything else than the campaign the village the sea you feel the rhythm of that ancient <UNK> life watching the movie in a cold snowy late afternoon can cause you to approach this evening dinner with some <UNK> expectations br br the final sentence that give a title to <UNK> sacrifice far from paris an artist is never poor br br superb photography many situations depict <UNK> and landscapes as they were <UNK> on <UNK> there in <UNK> in 18th century
<START> to keep it as simple as possible this is a very good show that is well written and has a fantastic cast it's not loaded with blood and guts and centers around a <UNK> cop and his relationship with his ex wife his son his former partner andre <UNK> his childhood friend now a priest george and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode are you likely to find something like this going on in your city no is this still a good story yes and it's nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws watch more then one 2 3 and you'll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show and thank you david morse for making this character so interesting another good job
<START> death wish 3 brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul now retired yeah right before long is back to his old ways but this time its not just a few <UNK> at a time its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city new york again by the way this time its war so out the big guns literally for this the body count <UNK> his one rivals anything stallone or <UNK> have come up with this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die or get severely injured in creative ways which is always a good thing the violence is not as personal in this one its obviously on a much <UNK> scale sort of like bombing your victims from <UNK> rather than one on one combat this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2 making it easier to watch there's not much <UNK> to this film its more <UNK> than anything its also cheesy at times and pseudo inspirational but <UNK> scenes fall flat they should have left the original death wish on its own without sequels but since they didn't they should have stopped here 8 10
<START> though this is a good enjoyable cartoon they did much better ones later on like this is almost like the first star trek feature which would have been welcomed with open arms and glee no matter what just for existing this is really a <UNK> of old bits with some nice touches but nothing special reminds me a bit of the hunting trilogy in spots and the ending is priceless available and certainly well worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits recommended
<START> i once heard this movie described as either you'll love it or you'll hate it from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings i would venture to say that this is true i am placing myself in the hate it crowd i have seen some truly bad movies boring movies and even low budget movies this movie is bad on all three <UNK> br br this island <UNK> <UNK> jeff <UNK> returns to his sci fi b movie roots as dr les minus giant head <UNK> the doctor and his assistant arnie george <UNK> aka the voice of george <UNK> along with girlfriend assistant vera are tracking a meteor this is the <UNK> of the cast and is almost a double date les has vera and arnie has his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka the computer lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid <UNK> and his relationship with <UNK> is more believable than the cold <UNK> like feelings vera has for les and vice versa the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor however it is really an alien art art <UNK> energy <UNK> device which moves around like a 3 <UNK> dog there is also the little alien energy being that controls dr aka the chief scientist there the alien is obviously and from the get go <UNK> and evil is this the kind of science we are <UNK> out no wonder the aliens from the <UNK> were afraid of us from watching some of these movies we shoot first there's no need for questions afterwards br br the whole movie is <UNK> with watching some really boring science experiments like <UNK> an egg or adding food color to <UNK> its not the fact that this is a low budget sci fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated it is really really really boring the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on that is it most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self now add crappy dialog cardboard acting and cheap sets and you have the <UNK> of an ed wood clone by the way ed has made some really boring movies as well please avoid the orgy of the dead the dialog oh the dialog such as br br from under 2 miles of ocean br br why not it came through a billion miles in space br br or br br do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific <UNK> of all time br br this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet this island earth <UNK> monster or in the same light as the outer limits twilight zone namely a low budget sci fi movie or tv episode that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations at the core these movies are enjoyable on some level the story the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations this movie has none of that it is just 90 minutes of boredom i couldn't even enjoy this on a ed wood level i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead it is so bad that if my name was dr <UNK> i would never think of showing this movie to anyone except frank maybe
<START> this is an excellent movie and i would recommend it to everyone mr acting is top notch as it always is and he <UNK> well with the other actors in the movie can't give away any of the suspense or drama found in the movie hell to pay is a must see movie the plot was very suspenseful i would watch this movie over and over again because it has all the elements of a great western movie it was very authentic in how they displayed the <UNK> dealing with this movie which includes the guns horses and clothing the soundtrack is enjoyable and adds flavor to the movie james <UNK> has the right touch when picking out a movie to be involved with this is a another winner for the western genre
<START> don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> because like the best of canadian films darkness <UNK> just below the surface br br set presumably in 1940s rural <UNK> the story explores the developing consciousness of young benoit as he learns to deal with both sexuality and death br br the look of the film is astonishing especially seeing as a high <UNK> of criticism towards canadian cinema by the general public <UNK> <UNK> beyond this the <UNK> benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience looking at his <UNK> community with fresh an innocent eyes br br i recommend reading jim critical <UNK> on the film in <UNK> best features for anyone looking to place the film into a historical context while also <UNK> the form of the film definitely check this one out
<START> this is another of john <UNK> come back movies and if he continues on with characters and movies like this one his come back will take hold br br this is so sweet <UNK> so if you're not into the romance comedy scene if you are this is one innovative <UNK> every performance including that of <UNK> the dog was beautiful without much more than a trace of the <UNK> found in dogma although as movies go i loved dogma br br travolta is not nearly as <UNK> in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe he is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read then you understand that angels were far from perfect you will not therefore be insulted by this film even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work as nora went to great <UNK> to see to it that it was the least <UNK> as possible given the subject matter br br i love this and love it more each time i watch it it's beautiful and sweet engaging and endearing br br it rates a 7 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> number 1 was really great summer popcorn fun it was the modern jaws br br number 2 is best summed up by jeff goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas or something like that br br number 3 is the <UNK> notice <UNK> has achieved all it ever will br br once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping <UNK> lie br br that said movie is ok if you don't mind knowing you already have seen it before br br
<START> oddly i have very little to say about the box so this will be pretty brief i have never read the richard <UNK> <UNK> button button from which the film is based but considering what i saw in this adaptation there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work the box is about a family who discover a strange <UNK> on their <UNK> that has a button on it frank <UNK> shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button the only is that it will automatically kill someone somewhere spoiler they push it end of spoilers that whole concept was interesting on its own but somehow they managed to <UNK> the movie into some convoluted stargate knock off that <UNK> it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message while i'm trying to be as as possible i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely i guess its from the same director as <UNK> <UNK> which i remember liking when i saw it years ago the box would've worked well as a short film but since it was so <UNK> adapted this way i can't come close to <UNK> it
<START> the <UNK> curse is the last in the series of the <UNK> mummy films and it seems that creativity had run somewhat dry by the time they made this one <UNK> and his mate <UNK> both end up in the of <UNK> and on his <UNK> he <UNK> out his beloved princess how they end up in <UNK> isn't made entirely clear but with various people trying to find them the viewer can be assured of some mummy murders br br the <UNK> curse was watchable but it really wasn't anything special i had the feeling throughout the movie that i'd seen this before quite frankly apart from the original the mummy with boris karloff the mummy movies are not my favorites among the old universal horrors they're not bad but they do get a bit repetitive br br there are some great scenes in the movie the scene with <UNK> coming to life in the swamp for instance but overall this didn't do much for me br br it's worth seeing if you want to be <UNK> and see all of the mummy movies but otherwise you might want to pass on this one
<START> wow i just loved watching all these hot babes the scenery around <UNK> and california was off the <UNK> i could watch it again just to see all that flesh <UNK> into those tiny <UNK> <UNK> i recently saw <UNK> the steaming hot <UNK> in <UNK> spring break as a center <UNK> in my favorite <UNK> playboy she is hot hot hot the opening seen was <UNK> when the two main girls run out of gas and stop at this desert gas station they drive the gas guy nuts with their bodies and skimpy outfits the slow mo lets me enjoy every inch of them my girlfriend liked looking at this <UNK> hot dude too now i'd like a <UNK> like that and at all the other hot <UNK> and some of the girls too any movie that can bring that out in my girlfriend is a 10 for me
<START> jerk mike david <UNK> playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away and his college <UNK> leave <UNK> sam <UNK> hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story they get at sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at mike that lands across his girlfriend patty <UNK> <UNK> instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment somehow <UNK> soul emerges with the <UNK> scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to <UNK> mike and the gang send the <UNK> <UNK> back to bring sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats mike and his <UNK> head for the beach to <UNK> booze play <UNK> <UNK> until the scarecrow arrives to end their little <UNK> substitute brother jack matthew is supposed to look out for him but decides to sleep with new love interest beth samantha <UNK> instead so when he receives a cell phone message from mike concerning how they left sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand jack is <UNK> with fear <UNK> estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after <UNK> condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to <UNK> hospital returning to the beach to confront mike because of his <UNK> not to mention jack's promise to coach <UNK> played by fighter ken <UNK> regarding no <UNK> jack and beth will face the same straw stuffed assassin that is <UNK> off the others coach <UNK> who was part of a past <UNK> incident that went awry causing killer scarecrow <UNK> has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against br br babes boobs and blood this flick follows the basic slasher <UNK> yet this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters acting dialogue and overall plot the flick shows signs of it's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off screen instead of showing it happening up close personal what appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's vengeance one fellow holding his guts another with a stake holding up the <UNK> <UNK> net <UNK> through his chest blood <UNK> after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the <UNK> etc there is also some dubbing problems where it's clear the sounds of their voices often don't match the movements of their lips particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where ed travis parker wannabe rock star is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with
<START> i went into this film expecting hoping for a sleazy drive in style slice of seventies exploitation but what i got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action it's clear that this film was made on a budget the locations are drab and poorly shot while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also the plot focuses on a trio of robbers a father and two sons that steal a load of gold after killing some <UNK> they come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl currently <UNK> in an asylum it's clear that directors louis and william <UNK> thought they were making something really shocking but despite its best efforts south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer the film <UNK> on for about <UNK> minutes and most of it consists of boring characters <UNK> off boring and long <UNK> dialogue the only good thing i have to say about the film is with regards to the music which is good in places the ending is the only other good thing about the movie and that's only because it's the last thing that happens i wouldn't recommend anyone bothers tracking this down there was much better trash made in the seventies
<START> he's not your conventional cab driver br br this guys got issues with his wife with his son a priest all his <UNK> his ex partner and most of all himself and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past br br the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so i think this is a great show and i hope people catch on before the <UNK> over br br watch this show
<START> this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie but i really find <UNK> <UNK> character really great <UNK> but determined to <UNK> <UNK> plus the main terrorist it gets me wondering his revolution makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad br br a movie that tells us about todd an <UNK> terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family gives him a the choice of redemption br br purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set up by stephen <UNK> <UNK> which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards 9 10
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> has come down in hollywood <UNK> not for the quality of the film but for the fact that <UNK> power died while making it i was in the <UNK> grade and well remember the huge news for days when that tragedy happened i didn't know who <UNK> power was then but i learned and learned to appreciate the body of his work br br i often wonder if <UNK> had a sense about this film and what a dud it proved he was the <UNK> producer of this as well maybe he just didn't want to face the critics good thing power actually went out with witness for the <UNK> although you can see him in long shots if you look close br br what we have here is a biblical <UNK> that probably would <UNK> the great <UNK> himself several incidents described in the bible that the bible treats <UNK> are woven together into one plot with a few <UNK> tossed in by hollywood br br the actual story about the queen of <UNK> is that she went on a trade mission to the kingdom of israel <UNK> up a bit came back with a lot of trade goods and that was that the story of a romance between her and <UNK> is of legend the ancient kingdom of <UNK> is about where <UNK> is now and her people <UNK> moved to the african continent which is how <UNK> was <UNK> br br the queen never witnessed <UNK> famous case involving the two women with separate claims for a baby nor was she involved with the building of the first temple nor was she around for the destruction of same for that matter neither was <UNK> br br and she was not involved in the <UNK> over the succession when <UNK> brother put in a that is the heart of this film upon hearing the news that king david is dying declares himself king of course david <UNK> <UNK> and says that god came to him and said <UNK> should succeed him when david hears about what did he says that's what got god all bent out of shape being greedy after that gets to plotting br br things seem to come full circle in that <UNK> power <UNK> on the set while <UNK> with george sanders as sanders and power were rivals in many films most particularly in of london which was <UNK> breakthrough role if sanders is not quite the jaded <UNK> he was in <UNK> and <UNK> he's still sanders the biblical <UNK> br br when power died <UNK> <UNK> was brought in to play <UNK> and given a wig so that existing footage of power in long shot could be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the dialog with the proper dignity but i think he probably <UNK> doing the <UNK> hitting br br gina <UNK> is the queen of <UNK> and she is <UNK> as a biblical <UNK> in the cecil b demille tradition she seems not to have any real conviction and my guess is she was shocked at <UNK> sudden demise and having to do it all over again marisa as may give the best performance in the film br br the real story with is not as elaborate as this film he <UNK> with <UNK> for the succession and gathered around a group of some of king david's court as supporters <UNK> <UNK> them once and then asked for in marriage in the bible and here was an adopted daughter of king david in his old age when <UNK> hears that he decides is getting greedy again and has him killed the bible mentions someone named who was going around basically doing contract hits on supporters br br what we have in the film is a spectacular climax involving a miracle that i searched for and couldn't find it came from the <UNK> imagination of director king <UNK> who ended a long and distinguished career on a sour note it was a question of <UNK> trying to out do cecil b demille in biblical spectacle br br he didn't make it
<START> i remember being so excited on saturday nights when i was a kid waiting for dr who i thought it was the best show ever made then i grew up dr who went off the air and no one i knew had ever heard of it then i found out there was going to be a new series i was a little nervous about it was it going to live up to the expectations i had carried around since i was little would they screw it up would the dr suck would his assistant suck would they create a more intimate relationship with the dr and his assistant yes no no no no this show is wonderful i love the new dr i love his assistant i love the show and i find myself excited on friday nights now waiting for the new episode i'm just now seeing 2005 episodes as i live in the states so i'm a little behind the rest of you i hope the next dr is as great as this one
<START> a typical old b w film the dialogues are sometimes good but too often especially in the second half they get naive sometimes awfully naive occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical the first third with its background information on <UNK> <UNK> shown with a series of interesting flashbacks is the best part of the movie but once <UNK> moves into his new villa and makes his moves on betty field the film gets overly melodramatic the ending is yet another cop out ending i don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb clichéd ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it but i've always considered car <UNK> to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story i've seen this plot device a million times or if it's not a car then it's a fall from a horse the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a car accident lame and to make things worse the accident is outrageously <UNK> and preposterous both plot wise and time wise plot wise because <UNK> husband's mistress winters gets killed by field and the fact that winters sort of rushes out from the gas station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house and of course at the very moment that she comes out she sees <UNK> car and mistakes it for <UNK> husband's car and then shouts over here i'm here run me over and make the ending tragic that way time wise because <UNK> and field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell <UNK> husband about their affair basically there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident it also doesn't exactly help this movie how husband da <UNK> goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife he basically does this by walking around like a zombie going from car to car looking for <UNK> and acting very badly indeed both da acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing respectively br br scott fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by hollywood's screenwriters and although he was dead long before this movie was done he might have been right to complain judging by this film's naive script or maybe his novels are even <UNK> and more naive than this film and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations or the films are pretty much like the novels i could of course read this particular novel to find out but i just can't be bothered <UNK> name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books and i don't mean the way his name sounds he was certainly no <UNK> or <UNK> more like <UNK>  a lot of noise about nothing
<START> as far as i know this was my first experience with <UNK> movies it's such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of <UNK> in the big world i can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or other br br because it's really worth while i left the cinema feeling really sad i couldn't get the tragic <UNK> of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film not only was it a tragic story it had excellent comic <UNK> and a very good soundtrack br br if you have the opportunity watch it it's really thought provoking and made me <UNK> a lot br br
<START> rented this from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re release br br micheal <UNK> is not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that ice <UNK> action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with ice t edited in i hope they paid for that footage br br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those <UNK> holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new york russian accents ice t being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they weren't worried about it br br micheal <UNK> should go back to doing what he's good at and make american ninja 6
<START> five medical students kevin bacon david william baldwin dr joe <UNK> oliver <UNK> randy julia roberts dr rachel <UNK> sutherland nelson experiment with <UNK> near death <UNK> experiences re searching for medical personal enlightenment one by one each medical <UNK> heart is stopped then <UNK> br br under temporary death spells each experiences bizarre visions including forgotten childhood memories their flashbacks are like children's nightmares the <UNK> students are disturbed by remembering <UNK> acts they had committed or had done against them as they experience <UNK> they bring real life experiences back into the present as they continue to experiment their dramatically <UNK> so much so some are physically overcome thus they <UNK> <UNK> deeper into the death <UNK> experiences attempting to find a cure br br even though the dvd was released in 2007 this motion picture was released in 1990 therefore kevin bacon william baldwin julia roberts <UNK> sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers besides the plot being extremely intriguing the suspense building to a dramatic climax the script being tight convincing all of the young actors make what is now an all star cult semi sci fi suspense who knew 17 years ago that the film careers of this young group of actors would <UNK> i suspect that director joel <UNK> did
<START> this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work i've never seen him act i've seen him in lots of films but i've never seen him act here are a few of the <UNK> obvious errors apparently <UNK> <UNK> still work even when they've been <UNK> in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini <UNK> i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i'm <UNK> now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs
<START> once again elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot bugs of <UNK> he's unsure of what season it is and bunny and duck arguing help matters not though bugs proves he's the <UNK> once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on <UNK> in increasingly subtle ways and when that runs out he does his trademark cross dressing <UNK> <UNK> freaks out and demands the bunny be shot though elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing elmer really is to blame for all this if he weren't so dumb he'd know it really is duck season and just blast <UNK> but poor old can't believe the utter of the situation his cruel plans of <UNK> have been <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is so shocked that he even goes home with elmer to be <UNK> in his living room br br poor he rules
<START> i didnt know what to expect i only watched it on a rainy sunday afternoon on pay tv right from the start it drew me in the music and settings and characters were excellent i <UNK> heard of any of the actors but they all were outstanding a wonderful thriller br br now that <UNK> read other comments on this movie referring to past versions and the book i will be <UNK> to find out more on this great movie
<START> but not this one i always wanted to know what happened next we will never know for sure what happened because <UNK> was <UNK> baby i am a <UNK> fan of gone with the wind and i could not have been more <UNK> by the movie i did compare scarlett to the original <UNK> because any film worth following <UNK> needed to be on the same quality level as the first <UNK> was cast beautifully although no one will ever compare to mr gable i am also a strict <UNK> leigh fan she was scarlett she fit the bill not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with scarlett the job could have been done better not enough thought went into finding the proper scarlett that was evident br br overall something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to scarlett and <UNK> i suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction this movie is not worth the time
<START> an excellent example of what happens when one central body controls everyone i liked this movie because glenn corbett also appeared in star trek as <UNK> in 1967 i also liked it because i am a fan of the apollo space program
<START> this move is terrible they took gods word and made a mockery of it the acting was terrible too why bother doing a story on something from the bible when your not even going to tell it correctly there were not just a few changes but the whole thing was wrong do not see this movie
<START> i have seen this movie more than 50 times in my life and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time george <UNK> played by treat williams leads a small group of 1960's 1970's era anti war hippies living at large in new york city this small group happens upon a young man claude <UNK> played by john savage who has been <UNK> into the us army for service in vietnam despite their best efforts to <UNK> him claude does eventually report for basic training in the army still <UNK> over his having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude for a couple of hours in the words of george <UNK> to an m p <UNK> at the entry gate of the army base claude is <UNK> <UNK> at in <UNK> the outcome is truly touching so i won't spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie the musical score is equally fantastic don of the rock group chicago who plays the part of <UNK> one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldn't have been the same without him beverly <UNK> who plays sheila franklin an <UNK> girl who is <UNK> by the hippie group is sensational in her role a must see film
<START> this is so blatantly a made for tv ripoff of black widow 1987 even the <UNK> titles are so similar br br if you want a better marrying for money movie check out black widow starring debra <UNK> <UNK> russell br br these movie is cheesiness at its best i just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended
<START> i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue it really got interesting there at the end and i really want to see where it is going from there some times we are to quick to kill a series without giving it a chance i think this one needs a chance to go on and i will definitely be waiting for it the ocean is one of the places that man knows so little about and i think that is a mystery in itself what is waiting for us beneath the waters of the world it is even said that man maybe <UNK> out or out of the waters many millennium ago is this a new evolution coming about are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position
<START> typical steven seagal fare that is it's crap the plot relies on a series of incredibly improbable <UNK> there's a <UNK> dose of conspiracy theory which would be much more <UNK> if we didn't know that seagal takes it all literally and once again bad movie multi millionaire seagal tells us all about the <UNK> of the rich br br <UNK> survival relies as usual on the fact that bad guys never fire their guns from out of <UNK> reach and always like to give a little i'm gonna kill you speech before blowing a man's head off br br watch this one right after the even worse fire down below and note how the carpet in <UNK> <UNK> apartment is more <UNK> than a big <UNK> of <UNK> br br oh and watch in the final fight scene for the incredible disappearing <UNK> wound which is probably the most entertaining thing in the film
<START> <UNK> br br this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material and thoroughly succeeded br br do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten <UNK> torn up and shoved up your <UNK> by a bunch of vapid <UNK> <UNK> characters br br this type of film clearly illustrates the <UNK> that still unfortunately <UNK> directors and audiences if the individual heaven <UNK> a collective could have conceived this <UNK> behind this had been <UNK> enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure and mercifully <UNK> it or just <UNK> it altogether the vein of adult humour being <UNK> here dates to my mind back to fritz the cat but lacks that film's avant garde status or even its base attempt at social commentary br br with the <UNK> of remakes and increasing <UNK> on pre existing source material to <UNK> storytelling these days one would hope that choosing snow white and thus not having to worry about <UNK> characters or a <UNK> new story would have allowed more time for oh i don't know interesting animation smarter jokes perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesn't <UNK> its <UNK> from the opening frame br br a <UNK> appalling production
<START> following the business coup of the year of 1941 max and dave the brothers <UNK> were removed from their own studio by paramount pictures corporation former employees such as seymour and <UNK> were put in charge of the new operation now <UNK> famous studios by paramount early on the finished product of famous was <UNK> from that of the recent <UNK> by <UNK> the existing series <UNK> superman continued as if nothing at all had <UNK> br br today's subject is one of the earlier famous <UNK> superman shorts br br as had been the <UNK> the superman cartoons were a great combination of fine <UNK> fashioned music in the score that goes for the theme <UNK> as well as all the multi mood background incidental music it was if each cartoon short had its own background music as all was kept fresh by apparently recording it <UNK> with each picture br br with regards to we must remember that this was filmed during the first year of the united <UNK> involvement and the characterization of the enemy was very stereotypical short handed and outright evil the dialogue and personality of the villainous japanese <UNK> was strictly from the stock characters of the old pulp magazine stories with their every word being said in a sarcastic totally <UNK> <UNK> as the characters would <UNK> their cold <UNK> as they made the most demonic of <UNK> and outrageous acts toward the <UNK> world br br is visually bright and uplifting stunningly laid out and makes use of some multi plane or table top animation in order to give its flying sequences a real depth br br making good use of the tie ins between the animated cartoons the superman radio show then heard over the mutual <UNK> network the cartoon bears a close resemblance to the comics page and uses the very same talents of voice actors bud <UNK> and joan alexander from the radio show br br we rate it with a <UNK> stars br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie has no respect for the viewer's time it takes a 15 minute story and stretches it into 95 minutes in order to achieve this they have to use a very slow narration and have everyone run around with some implausible frantic angst by the time this movie showed anything interesting in the plot i just didn't care the problem is not in the acting but instead the pacing the story is just weak jim carrey is a capable actor but his attempts to <UNK> light humor into a serious role is just out of place his style of humor is not generic so he comes across as a watered down version of himself the number 23 causes great grief and frustration to the people in the story but the justification for this is never logical at most it's just mildly interesting jim carrey has far more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals don't waste your money seeing this in the theater rent this movie if you've had problems sleeping if you are still wide awake after 10 minutes then you liked it more than i did i was not fond of the lighting and artistic aspects of the film making either a lot of passive visual eye candy was thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects and it did little to enhance the already weak story
<START> one year after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made its i t v debut it followed the route taken by <UNK> the and <UNK> by <UNK> onto the big screen in a picture made by hammer films it opens with a stirring patriotic speech the virtues of <UNK> green and pleasant land then cuts to a shot of eddie and bill walking up a street arguing <UNK> this <UNK> into a strange sequence of white and black <UNK> <UNK> their each other's homes at least the original theme tune is <UNK> even if it is sung by someone other than stuart <UNK> br br the local paper 'the is holding a contest to find the best <UNK> the winners landing a <UNK> cruise <UNK> suggests to joan that they should enter the thing is can bill and eddie stay friends long enough to win it that's the main part of the plot the film is by and large episodic one <UNK> is lifted directly from season 1 namely bill and eddie going to the club pretending to be on <UNK> <UNK> in reality they're going to see a stripper not meeting two girls another portion of the movie has bill along with other black factory workers in the series he was the only one breaking a strike eddie has helped bring about by various <UNK> including being <UNK> in through the gates in beer <UNK> while another seemingly inspired by powell and <UNK> <UNK> the love of <UNK> sees <UNK> <UNK> mother the magnificent patricia hayes getting friendly with <UNK> father charles br br the climax to episode 1 season 1 <UNK> in an expanded form bill once more puts on paint and a <UNK> to <UNK> eddie but his friends join him and they dance round a drum containing a naked booth so that they can pretend to cook and eat him eddie then has to make his way home in the nude surprisingly there is less nudity here than there was in episode 2 season 2 br br the film ends with the reynolds and the winning the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> contest and taking the cruise together but there's an unexpected twist involving <UNK> sex mad brother <UNK> james <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> who is working as a <UNK> br br this is your typical <UNK> sitcom into movie with all the faults usually prevalent in such films the laughs are scattered about and interest <UNK> after about half an hour the cast is <UNK> by familiar faces such as melvyn hayes cast as a character from episode 2 season 1 played on that occasion by leslie meadows bill <UNK> as the factory manager anna dawson lawrence who seems to have been in every <UNK> british comedy film mostly cast as <UNK> and arthur english the director john <UNK> was also responsible for the <UNK> about the <UNK> movie br br funniest moment while eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory bill paints his face black the first he knows of it is when the <UNK> secretary screams in terror the tables have been turned
<START> it is difficult to rate a writer director's first effort after all it is one more movie than i have written or directed james hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flow br br after all the idea that a man <UNK> rule has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common and even falling in love with the daughter ali of the man you killed has been done doing it again demands something that is original and originality is lacking in this film br br i was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites <UNK> <UNK> lies wayne's world pam <UNK> jackie brown frank <UNK> dracula good night and good luck and <UNK> <UNK> dawn of the dead they did not disappoint in their performances but they had little to work with br br direct to video is becoming more and more common but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time maybe the <UNK> effort of hunter will be more enjoyable
<START> <UNK> for making such a wonderful escape that's what i love about movies i'm so impressed with the the way they were shot and the timing was so <UNK> perfect with the music being a dancer myself and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped <UNK> and sometimes not even to the beat <UNK> the movie the relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement br br my favorite scene is the last one when she is pulled over i've seen the movie before a different version and i disliked the husband more last time i felt a little more sorry for him this time it changes how i feel about the female love birds its all so magical
<START> my dad had this movie as an <UNK> reel i loved it when he would pull out the <UNK> tape a sheet to the wall and play <UNK> the thought of a child who <UNK> through sounds fascinated me br br nine years ago my son was as <UNK> the doctors would ask me questions about my son such as how does he communicate with you i would respond have you ever seen the cartoon <UNK> i would love to have a copy of this cartoon to show my son and his <UNK> this is how my son see he's world br br recently i spoke with a digital transfer <UNK> who <UNK> most personal <UNK> films did not contain sound until the mid 1970's i guess i was pretty lucky to have experienced the sights and sounds of <UNK> in 1972
<START> ok so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being <UNK> right right consider yourselves officially warned and read on br br in this parody tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history the 1980's a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a in the house of the notorious murder <UNK> who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard as i'm sure you can guess things go from bad to worse faster than you can say where's the <UNK> and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody the dialogue is cheesy and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get good times br br no <UNK> or 80's horror movie clichéd characterizations are left here in fact no stone was left <UNK> at all  we have the cool hero his innocent girlfriend the <UNK> chick the tough thug think john <UNK> the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt the shy <UNK> in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt a couple of gorgeous half naked lesbians and two big <UNK> br br as you can <UNK> see the cast is pretty big usually larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly with one or two sour <UNK> up the whole barrel not in this case though not a single cast member left me disappointed the acting was very well done everyone from the cool hero in his thriller jacket played by <UNK> meredith to the <UNK> chick played by <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> one two played by <UNK> jonathan brett  they all played it straight brought their a game and knocked it out of the park if you're a fan of gary <UNK> in weird science you'll immediately fall in love with the <UNK> br br director co writer jeff c smith is a guy to watch for in the future trust me on this if this is what he can do with a low budget there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects the characters were dead on the atmosphere was perfect the laughs were huge the blood <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> beautifully  it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's call this one the breakfast club meets night of the demons the tag line says it all and says it honestly excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget no false advertising here folks as fans of this genre we have to look to the <UNK> and support these hard working folks who are <UNK> their out there bringing us original tales <UNK> we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered down pg 13 <UNK> or pointless remakes like the <UNK> no thank you no more of that for me br br in closing i honestly have to say that stupid teenagers must die is by far one of the best indie flicks i've gotten the pleasure of watching this year it's a bloody good time and holds up on repeat viewings from the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe even the closing love theme over the end credits which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter <UNK> mid 80's power <UNK> by over <UNK> <UNK> on every word starting with the letter <UNK> then i'll eat my dvd right now bottom line is if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general no more <UNK> this flick deserves to be in your collection
<START> the first episode of <UNK> to man with dean that just aired was at least up to scratch with most episodes of <UNK> and had me at my hope it keeps up the good work of on my tv richard is one of the best in the new breed of alternative comedy i hate this phrase but am too lazy too think of another one comedians on tv today i'm glad that on a trip of local dvd <UNK> today <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was sold out across the board even from his brief <UNK> in nathan <UNK> i knew that was a serious talent and i'm sure he would have been great as dixon in 'the mighty to continued success in the vein of these programs i also felt it necessary to <UNK> my review in order to secure a place on this public <UNK>
<START> i don't see what the problem is with some people and their need for intellectual humor you need to get your head out of your up tight ass if you don't find this movie hilarious if this isn't your cup of tea so to speak then look at it for what it truly is a damn funny movie maybe they did set out to make yet another drugs t a movie but in this case they've truly hit the spot it's especially funny for the ali g fans because he delivers everything we've come to love and expect from him so i say big ups to ali g and if it's not your thing don't <UNK> <UNK> boy
<START> lame ridiculous and absurd my 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children the <UNK> of the <UNK> of christmas is not <UNK> it's jesus
<START> years ago the feature film tried to be some kind of <UNK> blockbuster in <UNK> one <UNK> for sure i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director made of his series i think he missed his chance and wasted time and money br br so far many director's and writers have failed to make a series concept <UNK> to a <UNK> movie consider <UNK> inspector gadget you can see how hard this is by watching ma the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a never ending tv episode and not a good one it fails to deliver a plot the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very <UNK> as holds true for the visual style br br so <UNK> up i'd clearly not recommend this one
<START> <UNK> two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry <UNK> for example except for the funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office i don't go in for law suits or motions i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f ing baseball bat make a <UNK> with the maybe <UNK> that golden <UNK> then eat it and then i'm <UNK> upstairs junior and i'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers and <UNK> your brand new <UNK> up your tight a do we have an understanding his small role however is dan who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does <UNK> even funny its just stupid overall <UNK> ii is a good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it
<START> i watched this movie at a party we were very puzzled by the ending it ended rather poor even though the entire movie isn't too amazing i was expecting something slightly better this movie is pure trash but i suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror films with a weak script quite funny personally i loved the <UNK> it was my overall highlight the fighting scenes were basic a shot of a knife some shadows in a window fake blood i must say the <UNK> costume was quite scary this film is a mixture of kill joy camp blood and <UNK> creek 2 except this film has slightly better camera <UNK> and colour treatment compared with camp blood
<START> i really wanted to like this film the second film in the series had this silly drive in movie feel to it that was fun of course i was also drunk i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity a la mystery science theater 3000 i was wrong this movie is a god awful waste of film and i liked the second one from the <UNK> villain with the david <UNK> fright wig to the tacky obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door this whole thing was just a painful mess i actually felt bad for sue price because the material was beneath an actress of her stature that pretty much says it all an awful awful film that's not a recommendation
<START> here is one of jane <UNK> movies that i found very delightful i read the book first then listened to it on cd and was captivated by how a young victorian girl could be <UNK> against marrying the man she loved due to his lack of a fortune or education the joy of knowing that anne is evidently reunited with a lost love the fact that her <UNK> tries to marry her off to a good for nothing cousin who's only out for money looking at the <UNK> that comes from the upper classes and how class <UNK> can <UNK> couples from following their hearts captain <UNK> realization that he still loves anne after seven years his final understanding that <UNK> love was constant all that time and they she wasn't going to let her family <UNK> with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she truly loved
<START> director <UNK> got a strange academy for his last movie o is a bad movie but in <UNK> donna did one of the worst movies of all time his adaptation of the novel is ridiculous think with me how poor <UNK> <UNK> speak a perfect english in the film they do there isn't a screenplay it's only a very long with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with and <UNK>
<START> i haven't written a review on here in ages but <UNK> all of bottom tv show live shows and this i felt i had to make my views on this movie known it is i feel the perfect comedy movie it lacks the <UNK> <UNK> story lines i wouldn't really call with gina love would you or him and eddie going up there naked not love that make the rest of <UNK> go from good to crap it lacks the usual <UNK> that one must overcome in most other comedy movies unless you count the fact that they <UNK> the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma thats similar to other comedy movies no this movie just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and one thing only making one laugh what does one require from comedy movies laughter this movie just <UNK> on laugh after laugh without <UNK> up the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies thus i call it the so far only perfect comedy movie ever made and i will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie i rick and on such fantastic genius
<START> this was just <UNK> here in the u s others have commented on the <UNK> or lack of same to the novel the 1983 bbc version is far superior on this and all other counts given the scope of the novel it should not have been <UNK> to 85 minutes key sections have to be rushed or <UNK> to or <UNK> there barely enough time just to get in the <UNK> of events so character development has to be sacrificed we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are which <UNK> us of what makes austen so great br br one major negative for me was the cinematography which i thought was just awful and quite literally sickening the camera is constantly doing ultra closeups and <UNK> around and around in circles maybe on a small tv box this is ok but on our 40 hi <UNK> screen it was so literally <UNK> that both my wife and i had to look away from the set repeatedly my <UNK> supply had run out of course this did distract from the rather lackluster i'm just reading what's in the script acting isolated scenes are nicely done but not enough to save things br br adding up the score so far in the complete j a <UNK> i'd rate <UNK> <UNK> a success because of superior direction and production values and the story lends itself better to short treatment <UNK> ok though not the equal of other versions with again being at fault both far ahead of this attempt i will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this tv <UNK> <UNK> jane austen like others i am thankful they left p p alone
<START> dark <UNK> is about a group of friends that go to a farm it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something for a <UNK> but there are killer scarecrows lurking there there was something about a curse in there too but i forgot what that was about br br the acting in this movie is awful i don't know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses the script is the same story as the acting awful this statement coming up is very obvious but if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out okay br br the directing <UNK> too i see no potential in this guy's future after all these <UNK> this movie still maintains a fun factor that <UNK> it up to a two the last plus is they don't use cgi my overall thoughts on this film are it's bad real bad but so bad it's fun so it gets a 2 10
<START> i will admit i had the opportunity in the past to watch this film and after about 5 10 minutes into it i felt like many did i was expecting a monkey movie that was similar to the television show but instead i was given well i didn't know what i was given to be honest br br however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again it's the one movie that never <UNK> to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to <UNK> it's meanings and just when i think i've figured out something in the film it's answer is destroyed once i watch the film again brilliance indeed br br it seems that most people who disliked this film are wanting to watch a film with primarily a clear plot they want everything explained and all questions answered in the finale well sorry if that's what you're wanting this is not the movie for you but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking <UNK> experience this film will give you br br think of the film being like a dream in our dreams things make no sense things we expect to happen don't people places and things don't speak act or function in the same way they do in reality to complain about head is like complaining about a dream you've had that you felt you could not understand the mind is a complex system and being that a film titled head is just as complex is it that difficult to relate the two br br the music and musical numbers really stand out especially peter two compositions which remain the best tracks in the film can you dig it and long title do i have to do this all over again br br this film proves that the <UNK> were much more than just four guys in a <UNK> group as their critics called them on a television show but that they are actually much more intelligent and talented than the world would give them credit for there's so many messages that can be derived from the film both in regards to the <UNK> and to the <UNK> in general that it stands as a masterpiece of film making that was far ahead of it's time br br i feel had this film been released as an independent piece at this point and time it would actually garner the respect and admiration it deserves br br and one finale note br br one could compare this to the beatles magical mystery tour film since the beatles film appeared to be just as strange and bizarre however in my opinion head stands far above anything the beatles put on celluloid
<START> i have a question for the writers and producers of <UNK> nation what is the root cause and what is the solution to the <UNK> problem of personal depression in america in the moving performance of christina <UNK> as liz the film portrays a young woman with <UNK> potential as a <UNK> student and as a writer but this is not a story of success only one of self destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her the film <UNK> divorce family <UNK> drugs alcohol and <UNK> <UNK> as possible reasons for <UNK> <UNK> but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory br br at some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in the united states of depression in the story liz had a caring <UNK> anne <UNK> a caring roommate <UNK> williams a caring boyfriend jason <UNK> and a troubled but caring parent jessica lange in a key scene in the film liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break up of the space <UNK> <UNK> instead of <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and <UNK> br br this film reminded me of a generic made for cable victim film on the lifetime network an excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of christina <UNK> the real life elizabeth obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit
<START> i saw this film at the 2006 palm springs international film festival and director <UNK> introduced his film and was on hand for q a after for some reason this movie is titled frozen land in english so i don't know how the <UNK> got frozen out of this is a very good film it doesn't for me have enough that i would knock it up a notch to the excellent category but i did talk to some viewers who felt that it was an excellent film said that back in <UNK> people either loved this movie or hated it and said a lot of people in theaters walked out on it i'm sure some <UNK> to some of the violence swearing drug and alcohol abuse and sexual scenes it's a very clever story of how these different lives are woven together because of a <UNK> down effect this film has very interesting and strong characters i would rate it a 7 0 out of a possible 10 and would see it again and recommend it with caution
<START> any gun can play 2 outta 5 stars totally routine spaghetti western starring that guy who used to play on <UNK> sunset strip the plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold <UNK> and various <UNK> of dubious motivation trying to track it down this is one of those lighthearted westerns which means lots of <UNK> attempts at comedy and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences you can tell this isn't <UNK> <UNK> work george hilton plays a bounty hunter called stranger but he doesn't leave much of an impression he just doesn't have the style of clint eastwood or franco <UNK> who are able to do a lot with a <UNK> written character the ending is a complete homage parody of the ending of the good the bad and the ugly though it's barely amusing enough to be considered a parody the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes which features actors <UNK> after clint eastwood lee van <UNK> and someone else is he supposed to be eli <UNK> franco <UNK> it's not very clear who are confronted by stranger it's an amusing in joke for fans of sergio <UNK> fans and spaghetti western <UNK> but i imagine no one else would see the point
<START> oh god why is it that <UNK> has such a hard time producing even a half decent movie i mean this movie might have been good but it was br br a too short b rather superficial stereotypical and insulting to some c ultimately pointless br br first of all the dress up the nerd to look cool thing was very <UNK> very superficial very pointless and very insulting it has the stereotypical <UNK> stupid faces glasses never <UNK> <UNK> with his mom etc well maybe the reason that guy has never <UNK> a girl is because he's gay does that mean that all gays are <UNK> and what's wrong with being friends with your mother br br the worst part by far was the ending the whole drama of the movie <UNK> around <UNK> finding out chase loved her and blah blah blah and then when chase finally decided to tell her br br a he didn't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b he tried to text message her but her fell into a <UNK> and died before she got the message br br the end br br how lame is that i mean why is it that <UNK> just can't change anything in the series so many of us would like to see these two get together why can't we see it i mean are the producers really that <UNK> that they can't think up new problems to go with changes in the series so they have to stick with the same plot and <UNK> and make as many episodes as they can just using those after a while it gets dull and frustrating br br i wanted to see some actual romance in here darn it br br okay i'm done with my rant
<START> this movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas <UNK> br br he also loves his <UNK> so to keep the money coming in he takes his act to broadway br br see cody powers <UNK> blow himself up on his biggest gas <UNK> yet tonight 7 <UNK> br br however one day his <UNK> dies and <UNK> goes <UNK> he kidnaps the audience in the theatre and makes them all stand on top of a huge gas <UNK> br br losing control further he makes them all scream made it ma top of the <UNK> in <UNK> br br the noise is so <UNK> that it bursts <UNK> causing him to <UNK> from the <UNK> into a <UNK> of acid br br this warner bros movie is not all it's <UNK> up to be
<START> very lovely love story between brenda <UNK> and alfred <UNK> the whole story is very bizarre and funny an undertaker a <UNK> loves a married woman b <UNK> they try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village a scenario of strange situations starts as good as saving grace and long live ned <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed this film the way these mutants looked along with the tone of the film is very good plus david <UNK> as philip k <UNK> was great it makes me wonder if his personality is exactly the same in real life except for the killings of course br br i was impressed with the creatures for this film although this movie probably had a somewhat low budget the mutants creatures monsters looked great especially from 1990 this is definitely a unique film and not crap it makes me want to go find a read the <UNK> it's based off of this is an interesting film because it shows how humans can be monsters and the monsters are the one with humanity
<START> this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious <UNK> such as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> unfortunately depict all <UNK> or anybody who isn't a jew or christian as morally <UNK> and <UNK> the focus is only on biblical related stories that ignore the world outside the bible as far as they are concerned nothing good came from <UNK> egypt <UNK> or rome br br any movie that <UNK> about the one true god gives a short shift to freedom of religion the movies ignore the fact that ancient lack of religious freedom made it a <UNK> ground for religious <UNK> most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century
<START> on a flight back from london i watched she's the man apparently air canada has a crap movie policy perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie amanda <UNK> plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a <UNK> school across town even if you check your mind at the door on a 6 hour flight you have to the story is implausible and ridiculous there are some moments of humor mostly from comedian david cross as the principle but the intricate love <UNK> doesn't really inspire emotion although is is cleverly mixed with the <UNK> of mindless <UNK> the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest i guess if i was a 12 year old girl i might have really enjoyed this one
<START> i think the cards were <UNK> against because right from the start there was this itchy feeling like something was wrong but i couldn't quite put my finger on it then it hit me dubbed for a little while they managed most of the lines either as voice over or off screen with just a little hint here and there until it became painfully obvious this is the kind of dubbing that <UNK> on the nerves with nothing even remotely funny about it i hate dubbing but at least however misplaced martial arts films badly dubbed tend to have a sense of humour about it br br what i wanted was a film about a <UNK> doing actual <UNK> and stuff like that maybe like a reverse side of the table of the movie <UNK> being about the person trying to keep them out instead about the people trying to get in what i got was some poorly written nonsensical at times murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences a supposedly inept <UNK> who was <UNK> without his little ego and a director who obviously didn't know how to handle a camera i just wanted to reach in there grab the camera from the guy and shoot the <UNK> thing myself the editing wasn't much better the acting well i guess if the lead guy didn't have such a bad script to work from he'd be at least watchable the main bad guy was ok too but pretty much everyone else was a joke dubbing didn't help but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into consideration br br before i get into more bad let's <UNK> up to a few good things well one or two despite the <UNK> graphics i rather enjoyed the stuff what little there was of it and would have much rather watched a movie mostly about in and around that than the tepid surroundings outside in the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> thing seemed kind of cool but ended up being rather useless in the scheme of things the heart gadget which reminded me of <UNK> del <UNK> was interesting though as a plot device ripped directly from the pages of escape from new york it was horribly conceived in the long run there's one point where the bad guy is unconscious and our hero is right there why didn't he try the bad guy's thumb print then since the heart device was thumb <UNK> nonetheless some interesting <UNK> and <UNK> stuff if only they could have been <UNK> better br br now who here <UNK> compare this movie to blade runner both films take place sometime in the future and there's some kind of off <UNK> type of romance in it sort of in both films there's the investigation of a murder but i've seen many a film with a murder at its center that are nothing like either blade runner or identity for instance that's about where the similarities end period there is no comparison just as there wouldn't be between blade runner and <UNK> <UNK> scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some <UNK> of film making like where to put the camera is cheap and not just because of the budget it's cheap because of bad writing and because it more often than not takes the easy way out like writing in a character who barely appeared in the first place to save the girl in the end to get her to point b by herself without the hero so that he could do his thing very convenient or the attempted sympathy factor for a character we have no reason to care for or inane things like the car set up to <UNK> them just enough for someone to get away br br it tries to be hip it tries to be <UNK> it even tries a twist ending that's not the least bit surprising and it tries to be thrilling but a bunch of near identical chase sequences bad writing editing horribly shot bad acting etc does not a thrilling movie make
<START> i am a huge <UNK> d fan and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world but the most entertaining it's not laugh a minute but that's not what the d intended it to be i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows <UNK> both albums and that made it even more enjoyable plenty of inside jokes from past <UNK> d albums and hbo shows since i knew the new album already i knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy i would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie hands down br br see this movie now
<START> after three hours in the cinema hall the strongest impression garnered was that their is something <UNK> what was clear was that the directors forgot to direct the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write <UNK> without reason and made one cringe the script moved on and on with lots of <UNK> twists and turns ending in now too familiar <UNK> theory of <UNK> actors at a single point this theory worked well in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but somehow managed to <UNK> this time so did the habit of every actor's <UNK> to answer asked of them directly <UNK> questions such as what is your name would be repeated n times br br finally what was <UNK> was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence
<START> as it turns out chris <UNK> and david spade only made three movies together <UNK> tommy boy and black sheep but this was truly the citizen kane of their <UNK> <UNK> plays thomas callahan iii the <UNK> heir to an auto parts company his father big tom brian <UNK> hires mild mannered richard hayden david spade to look after him big tom is getting married to a ten bo derek so everything has to be in order after big tom suddenly dies tommy and richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from <UNK> from then on the movie is pretty much an excuse for chris <UNK> to do what he does best make a mess of everything br br when this movie first came out in the theaters i saw it with my grandfather he figured out early on that the bo derek and rob lowe characters were hiding something but you can completely ignore that and simply in chris antics nothing is safe around his stomach and hell <UNK> no fury like his happy go lucky attitude the scene where he sets the cars on fire and later the deer scene make for a pure laugh riot chris <UNK> and david spade were truly the john belushi and dan <UNK> of their era it's a pleasure to always be able to think about fat guy in a little coat time and again
<START> a rich experience is to be gained from watching this film br br this is a seemingly simple story of a gifted <UNK> <UNK> who later becomes a teacher of classical chinese poetry he is married with two sons and things at home seem normal he still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage and his sons alternately fill him with pride the elder one and disappointment the younger one br br his passion for the poetry makes him an object of <UNK> for a senior student in one of his classes the student <UNK> <UNK> draws pictures of him during class significantly one of him with a flower coming from his mouth she <UNK> him more with her intelligence than her sexuality although that too is an element he of course is not <UNK> to her attention though he tries for a while to keep the <UNK> line between teacher and student in place br br the reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and <UNK> <UNK> it becomes clear that she genuinely likes him and it's mutual secondly there is a long standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill the consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend both past and present are almost too sad to bear br br nothing is treated in this film all the characters have a vivid internal life and an easily discernible history the two leads <UNK> cheung and anita are outstanding as are <UNK> as the student <UNK> <UNK> and shaun <UNK> as the elder son on <UNK> br br recommended without <UNK>
<START> fans of <UNK> <UNK> productions will <UNK> several actors and vehicles from <UNK> which was made after <UNK> as well as sound effects from various anderson series barry <UNK> excellent music mostly unique to this film adds to the feeling of <UNK> for these reasons alone i think any <UNK> anderson fan would find <UNK> worth getting br br judged simply as a film it has to be said that <UNK> is flawed it is known that there were major problems during production and i suspect this is why there is a time <UNK> plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story presumably time budget constraints prevented the relevance from <UNK> br br <UNK> the special effects range from <UNK> good better than any 1960s film that i know of to <UNK> bad br br nevertheless even with these flaws main story is well told and keeps the viewer or at least this viewer engaged throughout the ending is perhaps not what one might expect from anderson yet at the same time it is typical of anderson and it is certainly appropriate to find out what i mean you'll have to watch it for yourself
<START> an unbelievable plot laughable characters and obvious errors in one scene where several grass <UNK> are supposed to be burning a gas torch can be seen repeatedly trying to <UNK> one of the <UNK> this film is a real dog
<START> my overall feeling about this film is that it was a slow drawn out wander through some of the worlds genuinely unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and an obvious message the film is composed mostly of fairly uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad <UNK> all slow down to a <UNK> pace and <UNK> with depressing music certainly some of the <UNK> and interviews contain some compelling stories but unlike what the description on the back suggests it wasn't so much the <UNK> story that's being told as it is the director's mr <UNK> and he doesn't tell it well this film could have included longer better interviews with the people themselves letting them tell their stories instead mr <UNK> <UNK> draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one i never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject and he never <UNK> what about the subject pulled him in in the first place he just drags us from one place to the next <UNK> lightly on the situation and characters hangs around showing too much <UNK> slow motion footage of people just walking around the streets then moves on to his next destination he does this over and over and over again without any real development i felt like this film could have been cut down to 45 minutes but it's drawn out to close to 2 <UNK> slow hours we feel morally <UNK> to care about the topic but the director's self indulgent meandering uninspired delivery of his journey makes you grow <UNK> after a while
<START> you know this is one of those <UNK> new clothes films it's like so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film well i think that's a bunch of <UNK> films like this which hide under the cloak of <UNK> or <UNK> make me nuts some person has this bad dream perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned <UNK> right before going to bed remembers most of it unfortunately and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius i have bizarre dreams too sometimes that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film expose everybody else to them and call it art weirdness does not in of itself mean something is interesting true <UNK> or <UNK> expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it if other people don't get it that doesn't make it profound it just makes it incomprehensible <UNK> for <UNK> sake for me is not good let alone great art and comparing to is like comparing the godfather i ii to the godfather iii same genre not in the same league
<START> the first of the italian rip offs of the french soft porn blockbuster though it might be interesting to note that the boot shaped country actually got their first with <UNK> 1968 <UNK> starring erika <UNK> is a very different <UNK> of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late <UNK> great joe <UNK> it is much closer in spirit to the now very dated just film from 1973 taking a look at male female relationships questioning such then hot topics as <UNK> and jealousy all in <UNK> exotic surroundings unlike <UNK> director albert thomas aka <UNK> who also made the hard to find yellow <UNK> actually a <UNK> up version of <UNK> <UNK> does not present us with <UNK> drug <UNK> snuff movie makers or <UNK> cannibals making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience br br photo journalist mae jordan aka lovely born laura <UNK> in her first lead role following bit parts as a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> 2 and an in just portion of the rarely seen <UNK> flies down to where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted british writer anne played by the very <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with a butch <UNK> that takes some getting used to anne shares an <UNK> remember when this was made with her italian husband <UNK> <UNK> meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse contrary to her subsequent reputation <UNK> appears positively <UNK> compared to her heavy breathing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> by way of <UNK> until the <UNK> <UNK> pay off okay so she does make up for this lack of at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train i kid you not br br production on this <UNK> classic is quite impressive especially the superb cinematography and <UNK> <UNK> musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre a hilarious <UNK> pop <UNK> try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full <UNK> worth of fun with the family that turns up throughout the entire film in every <UNK> type of rendition from slow <UNK> sexy to hip <UNK> disco br br this is entirely laura <UNK> show though billed simply as as was another actress on the same director's <UNK> <UNK> 2 she lights up the screen from start to finish not yet <UNK> to endless rape scenarios as she would be once <UNK> took over she seems much more relaxed than in later films even smiling from time to time a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the <UNK> work surely knows a flawless <UNK> rather than as the title suggests black beauty she <UNK> from dutch india now <UNK> and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel <UNK> she projects a slightly passive even <UNK> <UNK> which somehow her from the her morally <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in unlike the french film <UNK> is kept to a bare minimum almost thrown in as an <UNK> near film's end when <UNK> tells <UNK> that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with i swear you could hear audiences of the just version <UNK> whenever <UNK> <UNK> irritating mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of <UNK> <UNK> as an <UNK> for getting the divine sylvia <UNK> now living in the <UNK> capital of <UNK> by the way to <UNK> the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end <UNK> later husband <UNK> now deceased she has <UNK> appears on the <UNK> as the constantly drunk huh writer who forces himself briefly on <UNK> amid the african ruins at some point but no real sex scene though
<START> 'a tale of two <UNK> or is a true masterpiece brilliant psychological thriller heart wrenching drama and gripping horror all wrapped up in one beautifully <UNK> package from the intricate plot to the beautiful cinematography to the absolutely perfect casting every aspect of this film is extraordinary br br for fear of revealing too much concerning the plot i will just say it is very satisfying while it may appear to be a little difficult to understand at first it does a good job of explaining things in the end and whether you prefer psychological thriller drama or horror i promise you will not be disappointed br br from a technical standpoint its nearly flawless the set the cinematography lighting and especially the soundtrack all are captivating the <UNK> seemed an odd choice at first but proved to be an ingenious choice br br as for the casting we're talking absolute perfection i'm <UNK> <UNK> is totally convincing as the <UNK> yet troubled <UNK> <UNK> is equally convincing as her emotionally traumatized sister <UNK> <UNK> these two girls were magical on the screen i will certainly be looking into their other films <UNK> ah is cheerful and <UNK> evil as the stepmother finally <UNK> kim gives an excellent performance as the weary broken father br br i truly love this film if you have yet to see 'a tale of two <UNK> i strongly recommend <UNK> a copy it is a real gem worthy of anyone's collection br br 10 10
<START> as powerful as the true story of is this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had the chance to tell it br br it is allegedly based on her <UNK> but she is illiterate how does that work br br that said some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn't bad with some sensitivity being shown br br really though this story needs to be old in a tv series far to much happens to <UNK> into a couple of hours br br read her autobiography highly recommended it is a fantastic story
<START> this is my favorite movie that portrays african americans in whole different light because it shows a different side of african americans that it is not shown in the movies its not the gang bang urban ghetto setting or having to deal with deep racial issues it <UNK> the whole essence of being young and trying to be successful and having problems with letting your guard down and letting someone into your life and the whole <UNK> atmosphere gives that great touch that makes all that great its a great script great <UNK> that <UNK> you and you just get involved with the character perfect casting with a lot of chemistry and very good acting and i still haven't seen any other movie with black characters that are portrayed in this format the only one that get close is <UNK> but since its a comedy it <UNK> it very quickly i give this movie 9 out of 10 and i wish they would keep making movies with this type of attitude about african americans
<START> well its a great work by and some where people like this makes us believe that there is a lot more concepts till now which has to be expressed and the film is a great media to do that well all great actors together hence nothing to say about acting or directing but the film gave us a great message through out it has nicely predicted the <UNK> of human minds with that of the patient we all believe that what we believe is true with our own point of view and we want to solve all the problem <UNK> hence from the professor to the maid servant all tried their own ways so when was discussing with her wife he says that <UNK> is looking for a thing which she will never and the wife replies <UNK> not we all ' so that was a great comment which after the film left me with a great question <UNK> we all sick '
<START> i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit this would be a natural for dvd re issue it seems to me many of the performers have gone on to greater fame robert hardy sean connery to name a couple though it was a role i still remember judy <UNK> then in her <UNK> as <UNK> of france henry v she was very lovely then as now br br there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color is this so who of us would know virtually no color tv in those days <UNK> the pity no <UNK> if so some might have recorded it as a way of teaching english history this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage br br what a fine re issue this would be
<START> coming on the heels of that 1970's <UNK> era 20th century fox 1974 offered audiences a low key sincere and everyday people sort of a drama offering a far different fair to its audience which was far more general than those flicks being a down to earth dose of realism that offered a lonely <UNK> to those shoot 'em <UNK> br br replacing lead characters that were bad ass detectives super flies and <UNK> <UNK> take your pick in <UNK> was a lone humble and meek teacher the we speak of is the main character pat <UNK> who is the one and only lone teacher hired to take on the responsibility of a sort of old time one room school house on an island off the coast of south <UNK> br br jon voight the name that the youngsters dub him finds conditions in the school terribly <UNK> in addition to the physical <UNK> of this little red <UNK> any <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> educational system was totally absent br br oh yeah by the way did we mention that further complications to any successful educational venture were <UNK> in two <UNK> facts those were that pat <UNK> was both an <UNK> and he was white with almost the entire population of this off shore <UNK> was black and very poor br br <UNK> these <UNK> and <UNK> conditions were the agents of the local board of education being the <UNK> principal mrs scott <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> mr mr <UNK> <UNK> between the two we are made to understand that the teacher being the low man on the <UNK> pole is <UNK> in most respects to affect any sort of meaningful long lasting <UNK> br br but don't you tell a <UNK> such as pat <UNK> that he can't can't anything that is spends a year of <UNK> <UNK> performances and is making real progress but alas the strong headed teacher won't give in and recognize the authority of his superiors while he is by law and <UNK> to him serving at <UNK> pleasure he <UNK> mr specific order and <UNK> to take his class kids to the <UNK> of south <UNK> on halloween for some trick or treating even going to the <UNK> act of stopping with them at the <UNK> br br next we see a western union <UNK> <UNK> happily singing as he crosses from the <UNK> <UNK> to the island where he delivers the <UNK> to <UNK> that bore the news of his <UNK> from his position with that school and district br br not being one to take his being fired lying down pat files suit against mr principal mrs scott and the board of education <UNK> his <UNK> as being <UNK> <UNK> reviewing both the offense and the law the judge asks if there are any lesser <UNK> that could be <UNK> for <UNK> being separated from the school system to which he receives a negative response <UNK> the judge <UNK> the suit with his <UNK> down while saying it's very simple br br the story is brought to a bittersweet conclusion as the see him off to the <UNK> bound launch while a <UNK> record provides us with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which had played an important part in the <UNK> educational agenda as well as our story br br in the humble opinion of this writer the story which we believe was at least semi <UNK> even giving the main character the name of its author was much more than a tale of a <UNK> happening to both me pal <UNK> and <UNK> this is a sort of depiction of a <UNK> that represents the overall <UNK> conditions that <UNK> the government schools throughout the entire nation just an opinion br br as for this film it was just one of many movies portraying the stores of common folk leading their lives of quiet desperation in the great <UNK> of the country which lie outside the d c <UNK> and the urban centers of enterprise and <UNK> <UNK> on either the atlantic or pacific <UNK> br br in its own small way this is a fine film which would soon be joined in the film <UNK> of 20th century fox by such great works as norma <UNK> and breaking away both being from in 1979 br br see it if you ain't yet recommended by both and his buddy br br note why that's me of course br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a little slow moving for a horror movie but the quality is better than you might expect for a director's only effort on imdb the camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and the acting  although <UNK>  is better than is often found in indie genre flicks br br as the lead robert field is rather stiff which is especially unfortunate given that his character claude is the film's narrator as well as the centre of its action however it was the entry of christopher brandon that i considered the turning point of this film  and not in a good way a twist is introduced in a clumsy fashion and slow moving becomes drawn out and overly <UNK> br br on the up side pete barker is consistently entertaining as father william he's the easy stand out in what is a fairly ordinary offering while the first half hour caught my interest i ended up feeling quite disappointed in the way things played out
<START> what uh br br this movie is so <UNK> and messed up that i literally lost a bit of my sanity after it was over i will never be the same person again i'm trying to put my finger on what exactly is so completely insane about it it's not just the hilarious <UNK> music or the outside of time medieval blade runner wild west <UNK> setting or the weird cgi grendel monster that looks like a man made out of animated <UNK> or even the <UNK> mother monster which looks like some <UNK> table dancer who grew <UNK> and <UNK> when she stayed in the <UNK> bed too long all of those things are weird but what's really the strangest thing in this movie is the acting i simply can't explain this script is obviously <UNK> silly but the actors <UNK> deadly seriousness through it all <UNK> is always weird and usually kind of boring but for this one he's gone into dolph territory i can't help but just start laughing every time he talks br br i will give this movie some credit for being completely <UNK> <UNK> and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring i'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one br br warning if you are planning on watching christopher <UNK> as beowulf be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's true when i was done with my beowulf spirit journey i woke up in the middle of the <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> of blood and milk there was a dead wolf lying next to me and i later found i had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket my vhs copy of beowulf was sitting on a <UNK> constructed stone <UNK> nearby <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> flowers the tape told me to walk i rose and i walked
<START> being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new i am discovering their <UNK> horror films as i find them on dvd i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in lee was a great dracula a vibrant vampire if that possible in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening the young people talk like cartoon characters even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clichés i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd they were all pretty terrible characters anyway i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline <UNK> but she leaves the story too early lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film it's d o a
<START> i watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly <UNK> bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seen and to think i had to <UNK> my mates to get this film out at the video shop my reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me again i doubt it they always say don't judge something by its cover they were right when i saw the cover to <UNK> gang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars don't watch this film i can't think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad
<START> a deliciously nasty black comedy about a middle aged <UNK> danny <UNK> who wants to <UNK> off his mother and <UNK> a plan to do so with a bitter <UNK> who wants to <UNK> off his ex wife the movie is completely <UNK> in its cynicism and gives us no one to like but for once that works in the movie's favor rather than as a turn off br br anne <UNK> as <UNK> battle axe mom steals the show in a <UNK> funny performance even though she's a horror you end up rooting for her because it seems like she could kick both <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> at the same time with both hands tied behind her back br br grade b
<START> i've been a fan of since the beginning of on the food network so i have seen her grow over the years the minute i saw her interact with oprah i predicted that this show would happen because i saw how taken oprah is with her and with good reason she comes across as very natural and willing to laugh at herself which is very engaging the set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas i love the lazy susan that the audience sits on there's just enough of a celebrity segment and she stays away from controversy and debate there's enough of that on daytime tv the show is a lighthearted escape and she hasn't moved away from her strength cooking which is very good planning i know there are people who hate her and hate her show that's ok you can't please everybody and somehow i think <UNK> knows and accepts that so just turn the channel i don't think she'd mind
<START> this may actually the finest film of 1999 no i'm not kidding this documentary directed by chris smith captures the very spirit of artistic <UNK> smith does the smart thing any documentary <UNK> should do he keeps invisible and refuses to judge his subject br br as the viewer watches mark and his efforts no matter how aggressive they may prove to finish his films he refuses to compromise and suffers repeatedly as a result but <UNK> we forget remember <UNK> scorsese and others started just as <UNK> br br and what a great subject he chooses mark his family and friends are all fascinating characters far more than any character created in last year's <UNK> cinematic products this film on the dime between comedy tragedy touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create despite talent issues to get off their <UNK> and make something br br the film is about maverick artists and their passions it is also about families no matter how co <UNK> and they may be and how unique and beautiful that <UNK> truly is mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams but also to his family as well and they to him br br why this film was not nominated for documentary of the year is beyond me and criminal that is assuming it was <UNK> last year this film is to be sought out and <UNK>
<START> i'm sort of between the <UNK> review and the hate review i've been a fan of <UNK> and a <UNK> for a long time and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities i went into viewing expecting the worst thing i've ever seen and wondering if <UNK> would turn in his grave over it but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked it br br i don't want to <UNK> the movie's faults so i'll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a amateur br br it's very low budget and shot on a video <UNK> so it has the look of some soap operas but once you get used to the idea then it <UNK> to be a big deal the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy still this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to <UNK> intent than nearly all the stuart <UNK> and brian <UNK> my main exception to those films being re animator and <UNK> put together the idea of being <UNK> by some old one is reminiscent of <UNK> horror and shadow over which isn't to say this movie is as good as those stories so the overall plot is quite faithful to <UNK> ideas one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid i'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that <UNK> words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie there was no real answer to that the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august take on the <UNK> so in a way this was a style take on the <UNK> br br i would recommend this film only as a curiosity it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget i liked the setting of the wine the <UNK> shots were sad though using the same stretch of beach and trees and nearly the same damn shot to convey 3 characters' long journey was really sad the director needs <UNK> upside the head for that the acting was standard for an amateur film with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for best <UNK> of <UNK> by an italian actress actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies maybe andy <UNK> watched her and thought <UNK> she'd make a great <UNK> br br one little to the director though the makeup on the zombies was like bad <UNK> kids i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching i was like oh so that's how we know she's evil and possessed but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman both living so it wasn't an attempt to say makeup <UNK> but rather makeup was left on after however possessed zombie does equal <UNK> contact <UNK> br br on the whole i still liked this movie better than the <UNK> and <UNK> films <UNK> the aforementioned exceptions <UNK> and <UNK> had much better budgets but this film did a better job at filming a <UNK> like story than they did and on a tiny budget br br one quick word to the the make up artist i know you wanted or something on fingers but long black press on nails looked really silly br br a quick word to the writer of the score i know you couldn't resist and apparently neither could the director who it but when the two characters square off with guns for a playing that little <UNK> from the good the bad and the ugly killed any mood that scene had <UNK> it was cute but cute wasn't appropriate br br the filmmakers of this movie have read <UNK> and had a great deal of respect for him i enjoyed the little <UNK> here and there the character carter with the bad dreams and the character <UNK> who becomes a <UNK> zombie
<START> how is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors were they forced into it the plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president they don't even try to give an impression of that just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous <UNK> on <UNK> politics the first five minutes the movie runs off the road and into b film drama about 1 a computer voting error 2 the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history and 3 a neurotic but extremely pretty female <UNK> who tries to tell the coming president about this she's soon the victim of the evil x files master <UNK> of the computer company who instead of killing her drug her to make her seem <UNK> but when she gets to <UNK> she doesn't tell him in fact the movie then changes from b film drama to idiotic b film love drama up to now we are so far off the original starting point of the movie that most people turn it off i almost did if it just could've been intelligent love drama but no it's not it's the kind of <UNK> i'm so nervous i'm being stupid all the time so please love me for it kind of love drama all with a slow slow pace that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie the x files plot of the movie or the comedy plot of the movie all plots fail on all levels which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of the love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking <UNK> hey there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female <UNK> yeah that'll work stick it in there br br meanwhile lewis black is <UNK> and put into a role where he doesn't come up with one single lewis black line the lewis black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film which it never does and christopher walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble to <UNK> the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the <UNK> closest aid in watching christopher walken being <UNK> like lewis black in roles that constantly struggles <UNK> to sound casual and ish but fail like titanic every time is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach heartbreaking br br and then enter the low point of the whole movie it raises the <UNK> enormously difficult <UNK> question should robin williams go on to be president knowing that he got elected because of a computer <UNK> the american dream and all good <UNK> as he turns down the <UNK> on live tv like <UNK> the dog would with the usual patriotic <UNK> of the <UNK> and the we're so smart that we're making history atmosphere that <UNK> in sickening abundance for the next million years br br the director and screen writer barry <UNK> is now on my personal list of writers and directors i'm staying away from forever this film must be seen as a <UNK> of a <UNK> production process where people barry <UNK> got to spend production money due to their personal relationships and not their skills this is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled people's wish for career success and the <UNK> mentioned great actors were tricked into <UNK> in it that's the only explanation there can be br br ps the voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in <UNK> and mills of course it was what else could it be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dish <UNK> machine
<START> this is the kind of movie which is loved by 50 year old and people who consider themselves aware in social issues but really <UNK> got a clue the actors i think all of them are amateurs do their best but the script is so full of cliches and <UNK> that they <UNK> save it br br worst of all though is the <UNK> that the kids are working on brings back all your worst memories from acting classes in school the <UNK> to one of the songs goes something like this in a fast translation 2 30 in the morning <UNK> the dwarf of society an emotionally crippled individual br br please
<START> this movie was so horrible i want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie i was a original fan of all the <UNK> movies but when i seen this i just began to cry i could not handle it there are not even <UNK> <UNK> in it like the original creative monsters this is so <UNK> cheap i come on a witch thats bull crap no one wants to see the witch they wanted to see what the movie is about <UNK> i am i right or what thats y we watched the other ones now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline this makes me want to eat my own <UNK> after spaghetti monday
<START> the worst thing i have ever watch br br the movie is pure trash all the things is bad on this movie the direction screenplay arts cinematography cast or anything else br br may i say more br br the main character is an boy it has to have 20 years of age approximately but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old in addition he is an very bad actor br br the editing tries to save it but with that very bad material in hands they can't do <UNK> br br as i said the cast is poor the text is poor that it doesn't help the actors br br i learned how to do not make a movie
<START> there are films that make careers for george romero it was night of the living dead for kevin smith <UNK> for robert rodriguez el <UNK> add to that list absolutely amazing <UNK> a <UNK> less flawless film making and as assured and as professional as any of the aforementioned movies i haven't laughed this hard since i saw the full monty and even then i don't think i laughed quite this hard so to speak talent is considerable <UNK> a <UNK> less is so chock full of double <UNK> that one would have to sit down with a copy of this script and do a line by line examination of it to fully appreciate the uh <UNK> and <UNK> of it every shot is beautifully composed a clear sign of a sure handed director and the performances all around are solid there's none of the over the top scenery chewing one <UNK> expected from a film like this <UNK> a <UNK> less is a film whose time has come
<START> i like action movies i have a for b flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting so i've been <UNK> my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster i can't you'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of <UNK> p than this bruce willis vehicle br br <UNK> is the story and i use that term loosely of a team of super <UNK> flying off to destroy an <UNK> before it destroys the earth realistic not really but who cares it's an action flick i'm not <UNK> the premise br br minor spoilers br br the movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters bruce willis is the tough as nails leader of the team and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around ben affleck with a gun for the act of sleeping with his daughter for some reason that didn't make me laugh it was forced like everything in this movie br br the team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can <UNK> the <UNK> okay i'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action the supposed meat of the movie more attempts at humor with each character going out to do some crazy nutty thing before blast off again lame finally they take off here's where the movie really <UNK> ed me off they arrive on the rock and set to work would you believe it nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful <UNK> <UNK> ten nine eight one oh surprise surprise we saved the day again br br and don't even get me started on the jerky <UNK> when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick i can only assume they were trying to cover up the <UNK> holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds and this from someone raised on mtv mr short attention span himself br br just when i thought it couldn't get any worse wait there's a <UNK> <UNK> ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual citizen kane br br summary the <UNK> weren't witty the plot well i said i'd let that one go the acting was bad really bad even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse <UNK> again bad i didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures think animal <UNK> br br rating 1 out of 10 i'm giving a half point for steve <UNK> who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times i was able to look at the lovely <UNK> tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance this is far and away the worst movie i've gone to see in the theater ever
<START> it is so nice to see bruce willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor he shines in this film as the near 40 year old image <UNK> who has totally lost touch with his inner child until he meets him face to face this is one of those rare films that doesn't talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the whole family it is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you don't grow up exactly the way you thought you would willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness the sixth sense with <UNK> joel <UNK> and he has great chemistry with spencer <UNK> here there is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting a great film to see with every member of your family
<START> <UNK> like many films of is perhaps not understandable for the rest of the world story based on the few short stories of who during wwii was the prisoner of <UNK> and camps in his books describes <UNK> life in the nazi camps from the point of view <UNK> <UNK> of author who also was on the <UNK> position among the prisoners was <UNK> for the humanity and <UNK> for himself he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and <UNK> ironically after the returning to <UNK> he stopped writing artistic <UNK> and became <UNK> <UNK> producing stream of anti and anti american press <UNK> after few years he committed suicide in the movie changes point of view character created by the plays only supporting role story is focused on the poet destroyed burned out by the war and and his one day love affair with nina jewish girl who escaped from <UNK> <UNK> although she actually hates jewish life and mentality as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so called <UNK> persons life who after the <UNK> are settled by the americans in ss <UNK> <UNK> patriotic <UNK> mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and or <UNK> german girls br br
<START> i saw this in 1993 on a vhs tape but have been unable to find it at any source since this is a very bleak and <UNK> look at the last days of the japanese army in the <UNK> anyone with an interest in the pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under from what i can tell this is historically accurate and depicts how easily men can <UNK> into complete <UNK> i understand the japanese army was completely cut off from any re supply in the <UNK> by 1945 so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened i might not have been able to identify with the film's characters but i appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive if i had to <UNK> a list of the ten greatest war films this film would be on it see it if you can get it
<START> having seen <UNK> about 200 hong kong films in my time i have to say this film is among my very top favorites not only is the plot engaging and in some ways surprising which these days is rare for any movie but the chemistry between the two lead actors is superb top notch casting and while often even the most serious hk films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action often spoiling the mood a bit here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot even <UNK> character relations the music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful with the release of the hk special edition they've even <UNK> the picture first release was grainy and the subtitles even if the quality of the translation is still lacking nothing new there all in all if you have to see a hk film that isn't directed by john woo or have <UNK> <UNK> fat in it this should be at least on your short list a truly fascinating and entertaining watch
<START> terrible direction from an awful script even the dvd looked <UNK> and out of focus laughable accents all over the map unlike most of the other <UNK> i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn out shots of nude or scantily clad young men usually wet or <UNK> with sweat looking <UNK> at each other
<START> 8 days no script that's what the dvd tells you is how the movie was made it's shot in <UNK> video that's occasionally used to good effect but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time it is very well acted and this helps a lot but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls women sit and <UNK> they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting so the whole thing <UNK> to a stand still after about 20 minutes would have been a good short maybe even powerful even for eight days they do very little why because they had no script how many movies have been made without scripts not too many i wonder why that is how many great movies have been made from bad scripts not too many why is that working against this major problem the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing topless girls shot in dark grainy <UNK> video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length actors again deserve praise if only there was a script br br also the video quality or lack thereof is really low end they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from miami vice the recent movie that is but that's not intended to compliment miami vice or this failed venture
<START> notorious hk <UNK> actor anthony wong is for once well not actually once he was a cop in the daughter of darkness films and a few others not a <UNK> weirdo in erotic nightmare usually recognized for his role as a complete in such <UNK> <UNK> like the <UNK> story and the <UNK> syndrome this time wong is on the receiving end of the <UNK> br br wong plays a guy who goes to a <UNK> who promises to give him really good dreams for a price true to his word the dreams that wong has involve having mad <UNK> sex with <UNK> hot <UNK> but the dreams come with a price that's more than money the <UNK> can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost <UNK> wong out of his cash and business kills his family and eventually kills wong himself <UNK> brother comes to town to find out what's going on and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil <UNK> but as it turns out <UNK> brother is a pretty <UNK> ass <UNK> himself and with the help of the <UNK> abused wife turns the tables on the <UNK> and his schemes br br erotic nightmare is one of the more enjoyable <UNK> films i've seen in a while absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other <UNK> entries like red to kill the <UNK> story or human <UNK> chop erotic nightmare though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter is more fun then some of the more serious films of the genre more comparable to eternal evil of asia a more <UNK> <UNK> entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore without being overly comedic either definitely worth a look especially to the genre <UNK> 8 10
<START> this one of those social dramas that wb knew how to put together and were guaranteed hits in the thirties this early dead end kids are sent to a <UNK> school where they are <UNK> cagney a gangster as part of a deal is <UNK> as the <UNK> of the school he doesn't take it seriously at first but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys the idea is to let the boys rule and <UNK> their community whether this is sound social <UNK> is beyond my belief but it's a movie it's a lot like boys town with a slight darker tone a useless happy ending what impact the scene prior hard but is still good wb would later make this same movies with bogart in the cagney <UNK> role
<START> a group of teenagers discover a <UNK> video game but once they start playing it they each start dying just like they do in the video game as they become addicted to the game they need to find a way to beat the <UNK> central villain the blood <UNK> before she kills them all br br the premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining however this horror movie is not scary at all it's actually more of a comedy than anything else the film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch sure there is the occasional laugh but for the most part the film is very dull pg 13 horror films can still be good like the ring or cry wolf the ring and stay alive aren't really the same type of horror film though stay alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated pg 13 the death scenes are very tame it should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good unfortunately the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered br br the acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances jon foster is not a very good leading man he lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him his character isn't unlikable just very bland <UNK> armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out frankie probably gives the best performance in stay alive that's an honor on the level of being the best player on the <UNK> <UNK> sophia bush is absolutely terrible as october her performance feels so rushed and so fake the most annoying character in the movie is <UNK> played by simpson his character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die br br in fact most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film it's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive the only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere it's a little old but it still kind of works the film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through i wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an <UNK> director and writer the direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better stay alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006 that honor would go to when a stranger calls stay alive is still a missed opportunity though in the end this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf rating 4 10
<START> a brilliant sherlock holmes adventure starring the brilliant basil <UNK> and <UNK> bruce despite many other actors brilliantly playing holmes and watson and making a great job of it <UNK> and bruce will always be the best two br br holmes takes a professor from switzerland to london is wanted by the <UNK> he has a bomb sight that could win the second world war his bomb site has been split into four parts each hidden in books agrees to give his bomb site to the british government on the night of his arrival goes to the house of his girlfriend he has drawn some figures of men if was to disappear the lady was to give the drawings to holmes on his journey home he is attacked but a policeman stops this and the <UNK> runs away is happy for the british government to use his bomb site but refuses to give it to them wants to look after it the bomb site is split into four parts each part completely useless without the other he gives one part each of this bomb site to one of his scientist friends then <UNK> greatest fear happens goes missing holmes visits the young lady was with the night he was attacked she tells him about the drawings the drawings have been stolen she says only one man came in during the time left to fix the light <UNK> the man she describes is professor <UNK> he is working for the <UNK> seen as he has the drawings holmes is done for but he finds the writing pad he used and using science he manages to see what drew by looking at the next page on the pad he sees it's code he sees it's the name of four scientists the first three he works out the code for but he can't work out the fourth the three scientists he has worked out have been murdered and the bomb site has been taken holmes can't work out the fourth scientist but neither can <UNK> disguised as a sailor holmes manages to get in <UNK> office <UNK> sees straight away it's holmes puts him in a box and has him thrown in the sea but watson and <UNK> insist they search the box and find holmes in it it's now obvious <UNK> is at large holmes manages to work out the fourth code a <UNK> holmes gets round to his house straight away and get and the <UNK> fourth part to safety holmes now needs to get <UNK> charged for working with the <UNK> he pretends to be <UNK> works out the fourth code and gets two men to go round and get they take him back and he comes face to face with <UNK> meanwhile is not in a good way he has been tortured and tortured to get the name of the fourth scientist <UNK> has had it with holmes now he has got him and his death must be a long one for holmes the idea is to put him in his hospital put a <UNK> in his vein and watch him die of blood loss drop by drop watson runs in and saves the day though <UNK> gets away but holmes was only <UNK> enough to leave <UNK> trap door open <UNK> <UNK> sixty feet br br so <UNK> dead no he makes his final outing in the film 'the woman in <UNK> but in he is definitely dead a suicide he jumps off his roof it was <UNK> second of three appearances in the <UNK> series a different actor playing him on each occasion his first appearance in 'the adventures of sherlock <UNK> was played by george <UNK> his second in this film he was played by <UNK> and henry daniels plays him in his final outing in 'the woman in <UNK> the first three holmes films made by universal were set in the war as holmes <UNK> over the <UNK> 'the voice of <UNK> was the first then this film and then <UNK> holmes in <UNK> then it was back to times with definite relations to <UNK> and <UNK> george the fifth and sixth times this film had a close link to the sherlock holmes short story 'the dancing <UNK> which can be found in 'the return of sherlock <UNK> a great film though obvious propaganda it was a brilliant holmes outing
<START> i loved it i had just sat through half of the glass house turned it off god what a <UNK> of predictable plot and bad acting and then i saw this movie i thought it was terrific loved both cameron diaz and <UNK> <UNK> in it i liked the <UNK> of the whole setting the traveling around europe in the 60's thing yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all of the bad things that could happen it held my attention completely even if i did think that parts were unbelievable
<START> laughed my ass off but probably because i was stoned that aside this is in no way a horror movie there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average iq person would think it was stupid on top of that i am living in <UNK> and have been for all my life and can assure you that <UNK> is way too small a country that you need and <UNK> to find your way back if you got lost i would <UNK> that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be <UNK> away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot secondly i don't think any part of the movie apart from two shots from <UNK> where none of the actors were in were actually taped in <UNK> the <UNK> woman is talking swedish not danish the helmet on the first <UNK> body is brand new the girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in <UNK> this is just stupid
<START> if vampire tales are your cup of blood then this <UNK> fest based on the anne rice vampire chronicles should prove to be a satisfying experience a <UNK> of the undead in a contemporary setting queen of the damned ' directed by michael is a story of shadows and darkness and of the unfortunate souls who <UNK> <UNK> for eternity br br the vampire <UNK> stuart <UNK> bored with a world that no longer <UNK> him has been for many years but suddenly the sounds of that world he hears from his extended <UNK> change and liking what he hears he <UNK> forth to investigate what he finds is a world filled with new sounds a new kind of music driving and <UNK> sounds that assault the senses and make him feel alive and welcome and he knows that at long last his time has come that it is time for him and those like him to come out into the open and face the world on their terms toward that end he becomes the front man for a band a singer and performer unlike any the world has ever known he presents himself as a vampire and very quickly <UNK> a following that <UNK> far beyond london where it all begins and will ultimately take him to death valley california where he plans to give a concert that promises to be beyond anything anyone has ever seen or experienced br br <UNK> is powerful without question but there are those of his kind who do not take <UNK> to the fact that he has revealed them one of whom is <UNK> vincent <UNK> a vampire powerful in his own right the vampire in fact who <UNK> <UNK> so many years before and they are gathering coming together and making their plans to meet <UNK> at the concert and they are not going for the music but there is something else as well at one point <UNK> has inadvertently <UNK> the <UNK> of them all the most powerful of all the vampires <UNK> who is about to make her presence known to all and especially to the one she has chosen to rule by her side as her king <UNK> and at the concert rest assured will be in <UNK> without fail br br make no mistake this is story and presents it amid a setting rich with atmosphere and with some exquisite moments though his film has less bite to it than say interview with the vampire ' or <UNK> <UNK> dracula ' he sets a good pace and there are some scenes that provide some real thrills but overall the film isn't as <UNK> in menace as it could be or as much as one might expect in the final <UNK> in fact the amount of flesh that is <UNK> wins out over actual blood letting though there is more than a taste of gore and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with the red stuff there's some good f x on hand too especially in the sequences that <UNK> the speed of the vampires as they move and <UNK> through the air faster than the naked eye can <UNK> it's a decent job by but he could have put more teeth into it had he played up the alienation hinted at by <UNK> as it is you get a sense of his <UNK> but not enough to get you totally involved br br in interview with the vampire ' tom cruise brought some charismatic star power to the role of <UNK> but <UNK> is even more effective with a look and an attitude that captures <UNK> perfectly he plays him with a sense of acceptance and under closer <UNK> you may even find a hint of <UNK> and longing it's a good performance and one that sells his character convincingly br br as <UNK> vincent <UNK> does a nice job too he is in fact one of the strengths of the film though his character is a bit ambiguous that however has more to do with the way he was written than with performance which is quite good br br turning in noteworthy performances as well are <UNK> <UNK> as jesse a young woman too curious for her own good and the gorgeous lena <UNK> as <UNK> aunt who ultimately plays a pivotal role in the outcome of the drama involving <UNK> and br br and as <UNK> is an absolutely riveting presence what more can one say about her other than she is a gifted performer with tremendous talent and beauty and <UNK> she has left us much too soon br br the supporting cast includes paul <UNK> david christian <UNK> <UNK> black <UNK> bruce <UNK> matthew <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roger and <UNK> with a much stronger story than the usual offerings of this particular genre anne rice fans especially will be pleased with queen of the damned ' a film nicely crafted and delivered by director and his engaging cast by focusing attention on the drama of the story and the way it's presented rather than <UNK> on merely providing some cheap thrills has succeeded in turning out a true horror film that is definitely a cut above and one that just may <UNK> your <UNK> for more of the same and that's the magic of the movies i rate this one 7 10 br br br br br br
<START> with <UNK> <UNK> on the cover and only 3 00 i had to buy it i enjoyed some moments like <UNK> annoyance with the pleasure <UNK> but i only really watched to see <UNK> scenes i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end it was a cross between clint eastwood's the good the bad and the ugly and for a few dollars more a 3 man quick draw showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the <UNK> <UNK> apart from that there's really nothing more i can add the actors gave good performances all except the assassin <UNK> whose performance was nothing outside of comical but the movie really lacked depth and purpose simply not enough to fill up <UNK> and a half of standard movie time so we're stuck with the main characters <UNK> wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball gets rolling for example the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times taking up two <UNK> of the movie br br the scenery really lacked depth and creativity probably due to the films budget i don't think we ever did get to see this perfect city of new angeles that was always talked about in fact when the main characters finally reached new angeles its set in a factory or warehouse full of <UNK> and <UNK> hardly the kind of kingdom the owner creator of an entire city would <UNK> in the super high security of new angeles was also always talked about but only a total of 15 maybe 20 security guards were counted even when the alarm went off not even close to <UNK> of at least a hundred men out there br br if you are a fan of any of the actors actresses in this film then you may want to watch it simply to add it to the list however if you value 1 and a half hour of your time or 3 00 of your money you may want to give this one a miss
<START> i normally hate <UNK> but this seems the only appropriate summary for <UNK> i suspect i am not the first and i'm sure many many comments focus on the idiocy of <UNK> with it certainly bothered me right off the bat but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how <UNK> work br br personally if i was a parent i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the <UNK> although for me it at least <UNK> a little action and from a conventional screen writing point of view you might expect the <UNK> to play a greater role in the conflict gee you have a widow cow maybe her husband was killed by <UNK> nope there's a much dumber explanation and what kind of a farm is this <UNK> <UNK> to protect all the animals from harm but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans they make reference to the farmer being <UNK> but what is he raising pigs for in all children's animal stories babe <UNK> web you name it the reality of farm life is at least touched on perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter there is some reference to this but it's never explained but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the <UNK> and what the heck is the deal with wild mike it was like the <UNK> scene in pulp fiction without the ball gag br br add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes a nearly complete lack of laughs and those and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known not to slam the current 2 box office hit but this movie <UNK> me it was taking up space in my local theater space that could have been used to show something worthwhile there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same <UNK> but i'm not allowed to see something like little miss sunshine so can cheat families out of an extra 30 at least i had a free pass br br i know that as a 35 year old with no children this film was not designed for me but there's just no excuse for such a lazy dreadful children's film as <UNK> in the age of pixar i was bored by the ice age films but they certainly didn't anger me like <UNK> shark tale was a weak attempt at street <UNK> but it had quite a few laughs for that matter you could turn on <UNK> at any time of the day and see something more entertaining and intelligent which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage br br i'm giving it a 2 out of 10 only because <UNK> the mouse was <UNK> amusing and maria had a few amusing lines as the <UNK> wife well not the <UNK> wife some other farmer they didn't really explain who she was they didn't explain a lot of things especially not why sam elliot the ultimate man's man had an <UNK> <UNK> around down there creepy
<START> the only pure life is one that ends with a signature in blood br br so says <UNK> anyway a young <UNK> boy who becomes a celebrity author the life of one of most celebrated literary voices is told from three perspectives his life just before he and four members of his private army take over a japanese military base and commit ritual suicide shown in color flashbacks shown in black and white and scenes from his novels shown in a kind of dreamy technicolor set design somewhere between traditional theater and the wizard of oz these stories are often told at the same time but are edited to <UNK> the slow <UNK> of life with his <UNK> until the end or the beginning when like the ancient samurai he so <UNK> he will be at a balance of pen and sword when his words and actions are the same and he is a full and pure being br br paul <UNK> wrote the screen play for taxi driver and directed cat people a bizarre erotic horror film which left strange impressions on me as a boy and in <UNK> he comes closest to making a really excellent film br br whats interesting is to watch the poet the homosexual the shy and awkward man with a low body image who <UNK> his <UNK> to get of of ww2 of which he seems forever ashamed become a body building samurai obsessed a sexual media <UNK> all the while still writing prolific amounts of novels plays and short stories br br a short and sweet version is to say <UNK> has no father and becomes obsessed with <UNK> beauty sex and self destruction in some tragic attempt to feel connected to something bigger than himself that he was always missing watching him with his fellow <UNK> <UNK> you see him happy delivering his big <UNK> speech giving orders and loving the control until the speech itself the point where pen and sword meet of course this ignores the subtlety of the story telling craft here which makes this transformation so natural and remarkable br br though the story fascinating at times really isn't this movies greatest success the cinematography performances editing music by philip glass and set designs are really what make this worth seeing and more than a traditional bio <UNK> br br one day i will pick up a <UNK> book he does seem to have an ear for <UNK> and for staging ideas but for now i'm satisfied with the film br br those interested in japanese literature and post war culture should check out fans of inventive <UNK> of facts and <UNK> should enjoy as well
<START> this movie was extremely disappointing i thought it would be another <UNK> but don't be <UNK> it's not at all there are barely any <UNK> related jokes that come to mind i don't even think they smoke any <UNK> in this movie the marijuana field is merely a plot device br br my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of their idea of witty dialog and make a movie the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting to say this movie has no is a huge understatement don't waste your time or money
<START> watched this when it was first screened and then missed it when it disappeared of british screens it showed a different side of old australia that we need to see more of good <UNK> of old hand and young then the realism of the hard out back was fantastic it was sadly missed this show was a cold look at the old way of looking at australia hard living and hard working the young <UNK> <UNK> with the old practical head real fighting with the young <UNK> of new <UNK> to add modern political <UNK> br br this show was the first of its type that i came across that did not try to do a tourist job on australia it was a great showing of the realistic br br come documentary realistic type of show some good films were out at the time doing a similar job it would be great to see more of this type of tv come from australia for it has been sadly missing this last twenty years for all we have been fed is the soap pulp of varying quality
<START> forget every spy movie you've ever seen this is what life was like in the <UNK> and still is in many places in russia and the ex soviet countries vera dreams of life of <UNK> as she <UNK> the west to be her reality is very different with a bitter mother a violent father and the ever present alcohol and her <UNK> for the future are not much better she finds a man and they try to <UNK> up a life together but he is <UNK> by the same environment both socially and physically the scenery in this movie is brilliant sitting <UNK> in the company of post apocalyptic movies but obviously done with no special effects they have just walked in and shot whatever happened to be in front of the camera br br forget your stereotyped cold russians of spy movies this is the real deal people are passionate vibrant and present in a way you'll never see in a drama from the west
<START> lone star productions sure <UNK> them out in the 1930's and star has the feel of one of the more rushed ones john wayne is u s <UNK> john <UNK> investigating a crooked <UNK> known only as the shadow responsible for stealing cattle stage and the like and giving orders from behind the door of a phony wall safe <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> indian sidekick appropriately named as well <UNK> br br early on we find out that union head matt <UNK> george pre <UNK> hayes is really the shadow the dead <UNK> is when he offers to buy out his supposed niece <UNK> half of the <UNK> ranch since this is no place for a girl as anita <UNK> doesn't have much to do in the film although in a comic moment she gets to use a six <UNK> to blast the butt of one of the villains in a night time scare raid br br there are a few in the film for one wayne's character alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film in what could have been a neat device a <UNK> out tree <UNK> used by a henchman is located right in the middle of the street and finally the movie doesn't truly live up to it's name as sheriff <UNK> never wears a <UNK> throughout the film that is a star without a star br br the horse chases the runaway stage scenes the <UNK> off the cliff another curiosity the horses conveniently get loose from the stage are all pretty standard stuff but john wayne fans will want to see this one for the charisma he displayed early on in his career for those more critical the white worn around the <UNK> by the good guy <UNK> could only mean that they all had a headache
<START> alice <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> living in italy discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days she starts to follow a trace of memory <UNK> which leads her to the small town of people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re occurring nightmares of <UNK> <UNK> horrible experiments has something to do with her own <UNK> br br the movie is interesting and the plot is good but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading <UNK> <UNK> is good in her role but even better in flavia the <UNK> and it's always nice to see star child actor <UNK> <UNK> role is too small though this is not a movie for the die hard gore <UNK> or exploitation addict but still a very nice hour and a half mystery
<START> this movie was a big disappointment the plot sounded great about a half human half <UNK> creature in africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young american adults when many of the crew members are found dead the 2 survivors are taken into questioning i wouldn't even call this a horror movie since most of the movie is actually about the <UNK> adventures of the aforementioned <UNK> 20 somethings which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high isn't as entertaining as it sounds trust me you rarely get to see the creature and the main actor who also happens to be the director screen writer editor and producer is incredibly annoying br br i was finally so annoyed by the never ending dialogue that i fast <UNK> to the end i had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movie and i was right thus this awful movie is utterly predictable too as if it wasn't bad enough moral of the story avoid movies that are acted directed edited produced and written by the same nobody and avoid this movie unless held at <UNK>
<START> this movie used to be played constantly on the disney channel when i was a bit younger and i really remember liking it however i didn't have great taste back then not to say that i do now so i can't <UNK> for my nine year old self too well the movie was probably a 7 10 but it had some good music so i gave it an extra point yeah worth watching i know that some fans of this movie are wondering what a certain song is the one that appears when she is in the car crash the song is play a love song by the and it is very hard to find and obtain in fact this movie is too i can't find it anywhere online or on dvd or on vhs i'd like to see it again so i can <UNK> if it was actually a good movie oh well
<START> i love a good western movie but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show i could only stand <UNK> minutes of it in hopes that it would improve but it only got worse and i had to end it each actor s stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards there was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural <UNK> or conversation the wig on rachel was obvious the actresses playing native american sisters could have played non native parts and should have wardrobe for the native americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking if i decide to watch it with any friends in the future i will do so not with the expectations of watching a good western but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production
<START> plot ed and alice are engaged they live together and are living the dull life he has slept around before meeting alice she has a lot less experience she decides she needs to sleep around before marrying he very reluctantly agrees they should both see other people for a while br br at first he is not really into it his wild days are behind him and he is simply content until one day alice comes back and tells him she made out with some random guy who of course starts to fall for her br br of course this is a bad idea which causes extreme strain on the relationship br br good movie you can see the train wreck coming but still good br br worth a rental
<START> <UNK> <UNK> books are always so <UNK> plotted with twists and turns and usually a great surprise ending this adaptation had none of that br br so much of what was great in the book the history of monk and the betrayed agents the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election were completely missing in this adaptation instead there's this completely new plot about bio weapons that was a <UNK> br br <UNK> protagonists always <UNK> in the shadows forever just slightly beyond the reach of the <UNK> the <UNK> of his books have always been the <UNK> of carrying out their mission this film <UNK> itself to <UNK> and car chases early on br br <UNK> monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying i am a secret agent for all the attention that he called to himself during the film and with all of that attention the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising br br granted there was some energy to this film which is why i'm giving it a 3 instead of a 1 it was also great to see some <UNK> pros like patrick <UNK> ben cross michael york and barry morse br br i hope that someday someone will once again do justice to a <UNK> film adaptation like day of the did
<START> <UNK> from <UNK> br br this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie br br you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof br br 2 how could people create such a thing br br if you never saw this film than you really don't know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage br br oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see br br this movie at any cost and don't say i didn't warn you
<START> this is beyond stupid br br two high school <UNK> travel to for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting br br <UNK> moore co stars in this one as the film was in 1986 was <UNK> <UNK> just a babe in the woods at that time br br moore's grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean br br <UNK> <UNK> with that obnoxious voice is in the film as well as two brothers who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent br br the writing is absolutely ridiculous highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other did you ever notice that when people die they go in the papers br br i rest my case
<START> a pretty awful film i'm amazed the likes of derek <UNK> vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it it's like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series br br the biggest flaw has to be <UNK> jones he simply can't act whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head <UNK> unless he put his own money into the project he should stick to playing thugs looking menacing not speaking br br also was central <UNK> around in dickens times as there were three big behind his desk br br no wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it
<START> <UNK> parker and matt stone the creators of south park finally get out of their <UNK> schedule to talk to the cameras while <UNK> <UNK> in their hot <UNK> at first when watching this i did not sense as much sarcasm as there was in this i knew they were joking when they would complain about different actors on the show and when <UNK> said he wasn't going to give his mother any of his money but there is so much sarcasm throughout that this documentary is more of a <UNK> full of inside jokes br br this documentary shows everything about south park up until the second season anyways it shows what goes on behind the scenes with the animation and the recording it has interviews many of which are fake interviews but some amongst all the <UNK> give insight into the show clips from both of <UNK> <UNK> spirit of christmas shorts are shown as are many good clips from the show if you were a south park fan then this should have <UNK> your <UNK> for show knowledge back in late 1998 when this was made now obviously the show has changed but this is still interesting br br what we have here is an amusing documentary where <UNK> parker especially and matt stone come off as arrogant <UNK> and that's exactly what they wanted to come off as they may be this way in real life but here it was a joke a <UNK> minute long insightful joke br br my rating out of <UNK> mins not rated contains language and sexual content
<START> just before dawn really surprised me when i saw it by being far less of a gruesome horror adventure than i expected instead the director jeff <UNK> up a wonderfully <UNK> and <UNK> atmosphere for great stretches of the movie building the suspense constantly until i was really unsure about what was going to happen but wound up tight as a spring waiting for it the lack of action in many parts gave it a very deliverance mixed with the texas chainsaw massacre kinda ambiance and when the action really kicks in its truly shocking and dramatic without ever even really needing to be gory the characters are about par for this kind of movie though more sympathetic than some and the bad guy <UNK> freaky the photography and suspense are the real winners in this movie and they keep it from ever being dull as has been suggested i firmly recommend this one to serious horror fans don't expect gore do expect a creepy backwoods tale with several awesome moments and a great <UNK> ambiance
<START> don't waste your time or money on going to see or even renting it it is by far the worst move i have ever seen its two hours way too long of your life you're never getting back if you're looking to be scared go see something else we went with someone who still has nightmares about the <UNK> and she wasn't scared in the least br br there are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt at making money now before i begin let me say that i loved the first grudge however the second one is something of a different story the plot is very in depth and intricate however in the end you are wondering what the heck was this or that all about the acting would be considered poor in a b list pornography film i could site several examples but i don't want to spoil it for those that are for punishment but i can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words it's <UNK>
<START> oh what a disappointment this movie is i can't believe it was directed by there's practically no plot and 90 of the movie consists of various people walking in and out of the screen <UNK> trying to interact with each other while talking about the <UNK> massacre the most interesting part comes right at the end but by that time i simply stopped caring while trying to <UNK> my <UNK> br br almost the entire movie is filmed with a hand held camera which is supposed to convey the feeling of personal <UNK> but there's nothing personal or immediate about most of the movie instead the constant <UNK> of the camera made me <UNK> to be fair there are some great shots too no pun intended but nothing that makes you go wow br br if you're not familiar with the <UNK> massacre the movie will leave you scratching your head if you are familiar you'll be scratching your head too although maybe for different reasons basically the movie states and over and over again that it was the <UNK> who murdered thousands of polish soldiers in 1940 this point is <UNK> repeatedly as though someone in the audience needed to be convinced of this basic historical fact however the movie never tries to explain as to why they were killed after all <UNK> of thousands of polish soldiers in the other soviet <UNK> camps were not <UNK> and were released in 1941 it is also never explained adequately how many people <UNK> although the figure 20 000 is thrown in a couple of times br br the acting is adequate with only old woman and lt <UNK> giving noticeable performances but they get to act for maybe 10 15 minutes in total certainly not enough to carry the whole movie many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their <UNK> looks rather than their acting abilities but i won't mention their names suffice to say that they are definitely not the oscar material so any claims that this movie was robbed of the academy award are simply laughable br br the tone of movie is wrong as well on one hand it tries to be an accurate historical drama on the other it <UNK> to cheap anti soviet propaganda such as showing a russian soldier tear up the polish flag and using it to clean his boots then there are some puzzling scenes which have absolutely no bearing on the plot such as a couple climbing on a roof or the of the university br br there are many missed opportunities to make this movie more interesting such as adding a political angle to the story or showing the german discovery of the graves or even portraying <UNK> trip from the soviet occupied part to the german occupied all of these aspects could have been the major part of the movie but instead they're reduced to a couple of minutes in the end we get a collection of loosely fitting confusing boring scenes about the reaction of <UNK> to one of their greatest <UNK> of wwii not very compelling and not worthy of at all
<START> this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full the first was rope which i really enjoyed with <UNK> hitchcock was more room to <UNK> free whereas rope took place all in one room i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more br br it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones as a thriller i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really <UNK> up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the <UNK> ripping apart from the <UNK> the need of music to <UNK> of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside br br the film doesn't feel like it should either they are almost globe <UNK> from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more <UNK> ways to get the plot moving br br the performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto <UNK> who has that rich ego evil persona down pat br br in the end i wanted more from this one i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films but i did have a good time watching it i can recommend it just not <UNK>
<START> the opening night for the <UNK> asian international film in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting for br br i would finally get to watch  i was tired of watching the <UNK> on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by in the <UNK> left me begging to hear the rest of it i was impressed by the and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto <UNK> driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist i remember being rather intrigued by the theme when i'd read a line or two about it in the papers ages ago especially so since i'd personally been very fascinated a few years ago by how flamboyant the <UNK> in were the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising br br once inside the theater i found that the <UNK> only presented disaster i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends of mixed <UNK> whom i'd invited on the <UNK> guest list i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about eventually and finally the movie began sending some fresh air our way or so i <UNK> <UNK>  started with chaos and noise <UNK> traffic and a whole lot of chaos i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of home filling up inside me br br thus began the journey of <UNK> an auto <UNK> driver in <UNK>  the director couldn't have made a better casting call with this character from <UNK> wedding to <UNK> <UNK>  <UNK> despite his non hero looks carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character <UNK> with all the nuances of a <UNK> driver in <UNK> he's a winner all the way but how and where he <UNK> to speak english even that <UNK> is the question however his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a who has big aspirations of being famous some and yet knows when to cut away to reality br br <UNK> on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone wouldn't dare to wear in a place like that it's funny however that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that she looks very very dazzling though especially in the latter half of the movie when she changes to indian <UNK> her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationships br br the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of <UNK>  the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are you see the dirt you see the primitive you see <UNK> exactly the way it is yet  there's only one <UNK> that it leaves you with  <UNK> br br this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is with the dirt and the noise and all the <UNK> that india is attached to  yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be in br br kudos to him for that br br the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see is the i found it rather slow at certain parts  but rest assured that you will never be bored br br background scores add a classy international yet very indian flavor to the movie the song angel which plays at a very crucial time in the movie <UNK> beautifully with the visuals br br i've also heard that besides the main characters all the other actors are actually just normal people who'd never ever faced a camera before that's commendable considering most of our so called established actors  still can't portray realistic characters on screen br br all in all watching this movie was a beautiful experience  it is a pot of emotions it's got romance beautiful visuals and locations great music a great cast  a package deal when i walked out of the theater i felt proud to be a few days later i asked one of my <UNK> friends who had watched the movie with me if he'd want to watch another indian movie  and his response was  is it better than <UNK> <UNK> if it is then i'll if not i think i'll pass from now on <UNK> <UNK> will be the <UNK> for every indian movie that i see mr <UNK> are you reading
<START> this film would be particularly fun for anyone who has been in the film industry especially in any indie capacity those whose inheritance includes a film introduction may not appreciate it quite as much i am hard to please in the documentary category this doc is different though its pleasure comes from an <UNK> realism of indie filmmaker <UNK> who are a hoot to be around and watch whether you've ever wondered what it is like to be in films in front of or behind the camera or whether you have worked your way through the sometimes painful and hard but rewarding indie world you'll certainly get a kick out of this film
<START> since the past couple of days i'm really hooked on the female <UNK> series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now  which is way too long  before <UNK> the whole box set beast stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main <UNK> of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles the original more or less <UNK> as a so called women in prison flick but already an <UNK> one but you can't possibly <UNK> parts 2 and 3 as such since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls and the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well the first film was harsh and gritty whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic don't let this last description <UNK> you however as beast stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance the opening sequence for example is downright fantastic still a fugitive from the law literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there's no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the <UNK> policeman that <UNK> her her run through the city with the cut off arm <UNK> on hers while the credits appear on screen accompanied by the familiar theme song is just pure and genuine exploitation gold the story <UNK> continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new types of agony befriends a prostitute though without <UNK> dialog and takes on a job in a <UNK> her own retarded brother <UNK> the prostitute while gets in trouble with the local <UNK> and underground crime network she cleverly <UNK> a thug from taking advantage of her body encounters a former enemy from prison and <UNK> <UNK> one of the prostitutes when she gets <UNK> to a <UNK> abortion meanwhile the one armed cop continues to <UNK> <UNK> the streets looking for <UNK> against our multi talented director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style beast stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing those who know character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs but this always gets widely <UNK> with wondrous on screen charisma and menacing <UNK> there's very little sleaze apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words in fact i think part three might just be the greatest or at least my favorite one of the series so far my only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when is locked up in a cage that bird sounds like a <UNK> <UNK> with stomach <UNK>
<START> after his widower father dies in a <UNK> accident young tom <UNK> as jim craig is left to manage his australian snowy river farm with only <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kirk douglas as <UNK> to help times are hard so mr <UNK> goes to work for mr <UNK> wealthy silver haired brother <UNK> mr harrison also played by kirk douglas when a big job comes up the silver haired older douglas feels <UNK> is too young and inexperienced to go along so <UNK> stays behind and falls in love with the <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> as jessica harrison br br the least satisfactory aspect of director george <UNK> the man from snowy river is a weak storyline observe for example the jessica is lost sequence of events the damsel gets lost in one of those freak <UNK> while running away her worried father rounds up a <UNK> of drunk men to find her after <UNK> bad weather damsel jessica rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff father and the suddenly sober men don't check farm hero <UNK> discovers the damsel after building a fire he decides to kiss her br br the romance is played too <UNK> for as obvious an attracted man and woman as <UNK> and ms <UNK> to make matters worse the douglas brothers have a dark history which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter the main attraction <UNK> is the australian scenery br br the man from snowy river 1982 george miller tom <UNK> kirk douglas <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm also a sf buff among other genres and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their ideas over effects premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen in a nutshell i completely agree with scott review of this movie i heard of this film and being what i previously mentioned a 60's and 70's sf buff with a <UNK> for sf stories with touch of the twilight zone i expected a lot and my expectations were <UNK> with reviews <UNK> the effects of this movie second best to kubrick's 2001 space odyssey what a fraud journey to the far side of the sun was ordinary convoluted half baked silly looking film with laughable amateur special effects and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as <UNK> which journey very much reminded me of the idea behind it all is not that bad but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth on which the same world is <UNK> asked for a master like kubrick to direct <UNK> to say robert <UNK> is nothing like that so he delivered boring and silly movie that looked and felt like a <UNK> tv series of those days not worth wasting your time on even if you are an absolute fan of the genre
<START> <UNK> was a card playing legend he was <UNK> in an interview as saying some day i suppose it's possible for someone to be a better no limit player than me i doubt it but it could happen but i swear to you i don't see how anyone could ever play <UNK> better than me there's a <UNK> <UNK> scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have <UNK> it in <UNK> <UNK> as a showcase for a <UNK> mutant power that's how incredible this man was br br i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was real life was darker poker pro todd said during the last world series of poker bob mike <UNK> and i had a drink and talked about <UNK> mike told us how he could barely talk hadn't <UNK> in weeks and how his fingers were burned black by a crack <UNK> in the film michael <UNK> looked far too healthy to be <UNK> <UNK> in the final years of his life when won his last he looked like a <UNK> but let's face it this production lacked both the time and the deniro to make that kind of transformation my other problem was that i wish there was more poker playing with actual hands and situations sure it might have bored the average non poker <UNK> but it would have been nice for the too bad the movie wasn't 6 hours or so longer br br i watched the movie with 3 non poker players and they all thoroughly enjoyed it just like you don't have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy <UNK> the <UNK> you don't have to be a poker player to see this gem can't wait for the dvd 8 out of 10
<START> alright how someone can actually think this movie is awesome is so beyond me i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny the only character it has going for it is the evil super nerd game designer and that gets old after a while this movie is so predictable the <UNK> are not funny they're forced you see better acting at the red light district and the story sucks it's so predictable you know exactly what's going to happen even the characters do not react like they should try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're <UNK> 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time her response wouldn't be smile ok let's get back to work i didn't laugh once during this movie and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3 to rent it because that's not even worth it adam sandler produced this movie i have lost all respect for him all his movies are the same his comedy style got old ever since the <UNK> came out if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it there's no way i would have wasted my time on it this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect ace <UNK> wasn't a smart comedy movie it didn't have a killer plot but it was original and it was hilarious i'm not knocking the movie because it has <UNK> <UNK> humor i'm knocking it because it sucks it's a piece of hollywood crap if this movie was presented to a production company and <UNK> have adam sandler behind it it would be thrown in the garbage <UNK> than a used <UNK> if you want a good movie about pot culture watch cheech and chong or if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14 17 year olds with loud rock music at every possible cut acting that will make your eyes <UNK> and your stomach turn and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating <UNK> for an hour and a half don't do it for the love of god this movie sucks treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it <UNK> in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen but it's actually so bad it's good this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much if not more
<START> critics are falling over themselves within the <UNK> of influence to praise this ugly misguided and <UNK> adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based ham <UNK> direction of the gory and shrill overly episodic odyssey is one of the many <UNK> of this civil war love story are they kidding after ms kidman and mr law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north <UNK> town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo <UNK> of the girl he left behind it's a two hour test to the <UNK> as to whether he will survive a <UNK> of near death experiences to reunite with his <UNK> who cares philip s <UNK> amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role <UNK> to <UNK> appearance as a corn fed <UNK> who bursts miraculously upon the scene of <UNK> lonely farm to save the day rarely has a performance screamed of look at me i'm acting <UNK> her sheer <UNK> nerve wakes up the for a couple of minutes until the <UNK> wears painfully thin released by <UNK> <UNK> for oscar and golden globe what a farce consideration the <UNK> apparently own along with dick clark the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure the <UNK> crime is that awards have become meaningless and small less powerful <UNK> driven films become obscure cold mountain is a concept film and an empty bitter waste of time cold indeed
<START> was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories his blind dead series started off great but had some truly laughable moments such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for the ghost <UNK> in the sea <UNK> he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him telling the tale of a silly <UNK> monster that brings <UNK> eyed terror to a few water tanks and <UNK> <UNK> br br a vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an <UNK> military mission where american pilots for some unknown reason drop an atomic bomb <UNK> <UNK> into the frame of the film somewhere in the ocean off the coast of spain the military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent american flag and a portrait of a deranged looking ronald reagan one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the eighties the other two are the hilariously inept <UNK> that declares the year to be 1 and <UNK> dated <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which would have looked really cool next to some ripped <UNK> <UNK> br br one of the monsters you will ever see rises from the depths disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb we learn that the <UNK> <UNK> bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish unfortunately for our cast it has no effect on the sea <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> on the coast of spain for some <UNK> set mayhem br br now when i say the monster is unrealistic i am not <UNK> it's not just sort of fake looking i'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been <UNK> but most of the time it looks like it was made out of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> ball and an old <UNK> not only that it has this ominous music that <UNK> it wherever it goes music that sounds so much like the jaws theme that it's a wonder nobody got <UNK> br br along with power timothy <UNK> and ray <UNK> are caught <UNK> and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal through a series of plot <UNK> our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to well i'm not sure what the purpose is <UNK> and power have got to prove the <UNK> is real in order to save their <UNK> he is blamed for a <UNK> induced <UNK> she is locked in the loony bin after a <UNK> none of this matters because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved nobody admits the <UNK> is real and it's not even dead furthermore power and <UNK> are still on the <UNK> from the law br br as illogical as it seems nobody but our heroes knows that the <UNK> exists despite numerous <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and a crushed <UNK> bridge and they <UNK> on an extended non adventure to track down and chase the monster away not kill it since they know they are no match for it their big plan is to use <UNK> to scare it off although their scheme is <UNK> the <UNK> causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support don't ask and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it <UNK> away the critical viewer would wonder why the <UNK> wasn't frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a <UNK> but never mind it <UNK> away and our heroes are sure it's gone forever the end br br i can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on a script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced in <UNK> puppet stop motion <UNK> at least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be <UNK> by a giant <UNK> head i'm not sure what was going on when they made this movie the monster is cheap but there are some rather elaborate <UNK> sets so somebody did spend some time making those not to mention the stop motion animation involved it's seemingly played straight although maybe this film's sense of humor went over my head in the end the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary watch it at a party for best results
<START> swinging bachelor matthau a successful dentist is <UNK> along his blond mistress hawn having told her that he's a married man with three kids after she attempts suicide matthau decides to get responsible and marry the girl worried that she's going to be a bright eyed hawn wants to meet his wife and explain everything to her matthau employs his faithful nurse bergman to act his wife and that's when things really get complicated br br a <UNK> comedy with irresistible leads quite often hits the mark but isn't for one second believable the script asks us to believe that us men are such one dimensional <UNK> that it's truly beyond belief but maybe this comedy doesn't need to be <UNK> too deeply just sit back and enjoy the ever so funny matthau the ever so charming bergman and <UNK> hawn who here basically created the dumb blond girl role
<START> coming from the <UNK> generation i thought this movie was hilarious it definitely brought <UNK> hyde up to date so to speak my husband and i laughed all the way through it would love to have the movie in my collection i told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it they aren't into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie it's been so long since i've seen it i can't remember but a few things i would have to say the funniest part was when dr <UNK> <UNK> off on his lab table and <UNK> the straw while <UNK> then up the <UNK> drug he had invented funniest thing i'd ever seen in a movie
<START> <UNK> although a copy of some hollywood flick is one of the best films i have seen it is not only beautifully portrayed but also has great songs and beautiful scenery <UNK> is his usual self his expressions and voice matches his character i was pleasantly surprised by sunny <UNK> portrayal in the film he is a bit romantic and lovable in the film unlike his other characters in his other films at times you feel like justice hasn't been done to his character sunny was intended to be portrayed as the good guy in the film but ends up looking like the villain at the end <UNK> <UNK> is beautiful and <UNK> she is her usual self in short a great love story with passion
<START> hmmm started well like a hybrid of x files first wave unfortunately if the mere notion of da lost time machine is preposterous to you then the final between one man with a pistol and 4 <UNK> century monks armed to the teeth with automatic weapons will seem positively ridiculous <UNK> only by poor acting poor script and screenplay or in other words giggle factor 5 captain
<START> i just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years maybe close to 20 in some ways it was better than i remembered in other it was much worse br br first of all there's the music it's just plain awful there are only 5 songs in the movie most of them used more than once the opening song is by a chorus of annoying children and the disco y title track is performed by rick it doesn't get any worse than that even the background music is terrible with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes we also get some truly lame slapstick mostly in the opening credits br br on the other hand bill murray is spot on brilliant as usual you have to wonder if he ad <UNK> the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines or maybe he's just that great turning a weak script into comic genius the best part are his surreal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> get out of here you're a menace br br you also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this at least half the characters seem like real people and mostly real people you would like to have around even <UNK> gets to do a more than any other eddie type character ever did and when he gets the girl it's plausible she's not <UNK> hot but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls see revenge of the <UNK> for examples of both cinematic <UNK> br br and when the plot seems clichéd well ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a cliché yet when they made this while it wasn't the first summer camp movie ya gotta go back at least to the parent trap it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre in fact i was surprised that there was no talent show scene wet hot american summer <UNK> the summer camp genre so perfectly i just assumed everything in it came straight out of <UNK> i also half expected jon <UNK> to pull up in a <UNK> with a <UNK> thanks to mr show's epic camp <UNK> spoof monk academy br br anyway this one seems to be <UNK> a little as far as the late 70's early 80's comedies it's not a cable <UNK> anymore and certainly doesn't have the cult following of <UNK> or animal house i was pleased to catch it on showtime today and in high definition at that sure it's pretty awful in spots but you could do a lot worse in a 70's 80's teen comedy and again murray is a genius
<START> i know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious it's not like american pie or something i know not why people are offended by the universal <UNK> since it's part of the plot the advertising is <UNK> br br this is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral that thankfully doesn't get too sappy great acting and a cheesy ending br br minor spoiler the basic premise here is the classic story of a shepherd boy who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf <UNK> comes along so he gets his best friend <UNK> and they go and drive the wolf crazy br br frankie can be annoying in other roles but not as jason shepherd he handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed br br amanda <UNK> what more can i say the girl's got the gift she's funny talented versatile and very very attractive i'm only 6 months older than her i need to get to california sometime soon in fact the <UNK> <UNK> part was originally a boy but became a girl as soon as the makers saw <UNK> interest which works out pretty well since the part would've been pretty dull without the <UNK> of abilities br br paul <UNK> is a very talented man while some would play marty wolf as evil and diabolical <UNK> made him not just a jerk mind you but a likeable jerk a jerk that up the screen rather than intentionally <UNK> it and i doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that wolf <UNK> as well br br all in all great movie loved seeing white able to mock himself loved seeing all the little references such built into the film one of the guests in the party scene is the director shawn levy another is former co star <UNK> thompson loved seeing amanda in those outfits get the dvd if you can it's got all kinds of great extra stuff and the lovely ms <UNK> is your guide through the <UNK>
<START> do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> instead it <UNK> the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiers br br <UNK> works on a <UNK> level that it <UNK> with its <UNK> attempts to escape from army <UNK> any which way they can it's not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles <UNK> of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtful br br just to fill the required 10 lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job
<START> hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the <UNK> screen he was the pit like one that was going to bite the man <UNK> up my dogs name was colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it again br br thanks all
<START> it's literally the three stooges all over again without the charm this show's nothing more than the worst slapstick i'm surprised they actually have writers the so called jokes are completely <UNK> and <UNK> for no other point than trying very very hard to be controversial and people think this is <UNK> get a clue this show takes absolutely no thought time effort money or creativity originality to produce any references present are <UNK> toward anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally <UNK> people magazine but i suppose this is only what all the <UNK> want like and need today
<START> is one of the movies where you find the loop holes in indian cinema here is one good example to show how excellent writers directors and actors <UNK> to the producers here is one of the most wonderful actors <UNK> acting in a movie about a real story in <UNK> the seriousness of the film is slaughtered with sub standard comic scenes and songs there is this character who in reality is the son of the producer of the film hence he doesn't have a hair cut despite his officer asking him to do so this kid doesn't know what is acting and he is the hero of the movie god help indian cinema with such producers br br this movie is a pathetic display of what happens in <UNK> a sensible viewer can <UNK> understand the constraints of such wonderful writers actors and directors who want to share their real life experiences but the unfortunate part is that a movie about the highest ranks in indian <UNK> turns out to be a pathetic display that only makes one think that the movie was stupid br br we should <UNK> such producers in the film industry and <UNK> way for good cinema
<START> this was a <UNK> and dreary mess i needed a shower when it was over it goes something like this some <UNK> are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case she discovers that the victims <UNK> to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about hollywood and its <UNK> about women what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and <UNK> ellen <UNK> gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and julian <UNK> provides unintentional laughs as a cross dressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a one star rating
<START> first of all it is interesting to note that one of the users here who commented on this film from <UNK> had to add that was communist if this user indeed watched the film the message was that he was not communist but <UNK> by none other than <UNK> the u s the un etc as a communist leader for other <UNK> and country's political and economic <UNK> even if one decides to accept that the film <UNK> in <UNK> history it would be naive to assume that was communist especially coming from the country which granted the <UNK> independence and since was elected <UNK> to his seat as prime minister br br onto the film br br this is one of the most important and powerful films i have seen in quite some time depicting the struggles of the african freedom fighter and elected prime <UNK> struggles as its first leader mr peck does a quite commendable job of putting together all of the pieces into one work and this must have been quite some task due to the fact that most people outside of the <UNK> and <UNK> likely do not know the history of and the <UNK> outside of some light coverage of african <UNK> hopefully in one of their high school secondary school or maybe university college level history classes he had his work cut out for him br br and to to think that oliver <UNK> <UNK> took over 3 hours runs under 2 hours and a most engaging <UNK> minutes it was as we find that his desire to not compromise with western powers whom he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people particularly <UNK> while trying to deal with power struggles within his own borders apparently even with some of his friends it is amazing that the man lived as long as he did br br this is a must see for anyone interested in <UNK> justice humanity history politics and true freedom you will not be disappointed
<START> it seems no matter what i see her in christina <UNK> seems full of promise but fails to deliver sure she can cry and scream but <UNK> nation sees <UNK> totally out of her depth perhaps i'm being too harsh okay i'm shifting the blame to the director jessica lange is outrageous and almost reaches faye <UNK> heights of unfortunately i think lange <UNK> with frances and it was all downhill from there there was every chance of this film being slick and witty while <UNK> depression head on what we get instead is poorly acted <UNK> dressed up with a stereotypical try hard eighties <UNK> i really had no sense of the films eighties backdrop since i was <UNK> with the lame attempt at making believe it was the eighties just because ms <UNK> wears a madonna inspired dress to her lost my virginity celebration <UNK> everyone you are all better than this the filmmakers should hang their heads in shame and as a result of disappointment elizabeth could probably make a <UNK> if she <UNK> for emotional <UNK> as a result of the finished product go on <UNK> sue i would
<START> if you want a horrible interpretation of <UNK> then this is your answer filled with <UNK> english language in a 21st century australian setting this film lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head but that isn't all br br not only is there <UNK> action sequences but there are plenty of scenes where the female body is displayed the witches played by actresses that resemble school girls more than witches put on a soft porn display with <UNK> in a <UNK> display of affection welcome to stupidity and <UNK> all at the same time br br its a wonder why this project was green <UNK> so much for modern cheesy movies d
<START> i have barely managed to view the entire film only after about out of the movie's did the journey to mars begin and then there were <UNK> left for the closure these 85 long minutes were very boring and didn't contribute anything to the film when finally reaching mars it wasn't much better plot wise it all could have been <UNK> into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missed br br what i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new born babies were named why would someone want to name his her baby after a villain who despite having only one <UNK> apparently has 3 breasts br br the only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes they are an interesting experiment in just as the <UNK> of dr <UNK> was for <UNK> five years earlier br br i give it 4 10 for the great looking design
<START> the gang is back for more ron howard and cindy williams are now married her brother is <UNK> against the draft and charles martin smith is doing everything he can in vietnam to get sent home br br the issues of the 60's are brought to light here but it's all over the place beginning with new year's eve 1963 then three minutes later it's new year's eve 1964 then three minutes later it's new year's eve 1965 then three minutes later it's back to 1963 again martin smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago and a couple of scenes later this friend is winning his next heat in a drag race and to top it all off the drug scene and the flower children enter the picture or pictures in some cases as many as three different camera shots are shown on the screen at the same time br br if you want to watch this film you have to watch this film but i'd advise you to stick to the original and leave it there <UNK> jack is heard in the beginning of the film before almost every song played in the background but <UNK> he go maybe he couldn't keep up with this film either and quit 2 out of 10 stars
<START> this film is in a dead tie with the original for worst film ever made i think this one may be slightly worse if anything spoiler alert here are these survivors on a ship that's been for a long time improbable no impossible the whole premise is so laughable as to not be funny there are some pretty big names in the film and even they couldn't save this sorry thing i find it truly a waste of good celluloid after seeing this i also unfortunately decided that it had been a waste of my time don't bother with this one or the original for that matter i gave it a 2 mainly because they throw votes of 1 out
<START> the <UNK> paul naschy horror film icon of spain lends his talents to this entertaining if not <UNK> film what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride br br paul naschy plays a cold hearted hit man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters one of which is his flame who is carrying his child to <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> from a <UNK> businessman when the deed is done the <UNK> of the <UNK> is too <UNK> for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese <UNK> his girlfriend whose brother paul killed <UNK> revenge and chases paul through the forest shooting him up and leaving him for dead however paul is found by an <UNK> with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to <UNK> br br at the estate the two daughters <UNK> and <UNK> fight for paul in his <UNK> state with the <UNK> <UNK> determined not to lose out to the sweet and <UNK> but things get hairy for mr naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds couple this with the japanese <UNK> looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides br br story the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but <UNK> whose character seems <UNK> and <UNK> simply lets win in the paul naschy <UNK> without putting up a fight personally i would have preferred the ghostly <UNK> story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman br br violence you get <UNK> a blown up babe and pigs eating some poor <UNK> alive gore <UNK> will not be letdown with this naschy flick br br acting paul naschy as always is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds starring with him again are the <UNK> <UNK> and the beautiful <UNK> who teamed with mr naschy in the little gem the <UNK> both girls do a fine job br br nudity you get very brief glimpses of both and <UNK> but they are <UNK> placed keeping the <UNK> bits covered full nudity is <UNK> by the two lesser appealing actresses the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for <UNK> and
<START> no offense to anyone who saw this and liked it but i hated it it dragged on and on and there was not a very good plot also too simple and the acting was so so br br i would give this <UNK> a 2 at the most
<START> excuse me cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon <UNK> and the mighty you'll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal
<START> a team of amateur <UNK> and tree <UNK> catches wind of a secret government project project on a remote south pacific island the scientists there are producing giant sized corn but the <UNK> are <UNK> to other species creating <UNK> large <UNK> dragons and a <UNK> one that's bullet proof and <UNK> underwater with the help of the <UNK> daughter can they escape the island and tell the world even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci fi channel which sadly i did it would scream sci fi channel with its low production value weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history the effects here are comparable to another creature film <UNK> island although not nearly as bad i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again br br which is not to say it's not enjoyable i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him but i thought it was a pretty good use of time as bad the whole thing is it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the <UNK> daughter is attractive enough to carry the film i believe the <UNK> name is michelle michael <UNK> also appears as a ship captain and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on <UNK> look respectable even if that movie is <UNK> bad br br i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be bad effects low budget no name actors i didn't have any higher hopes yet this doesn't mean that it's awesome either coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department for the one fan who likes this film and calls it hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement
<START> a wonderful story so beautiful told so intense so <UNK> no keyboard to describe i think go see it feel it it a story about love romance war and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it if you don't love romance drama well skip it that's all i can i vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful
<START> predictable cliche unbelievable boring what else can i say it's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this <UNK> mess oh yeah and the entertaining end zone antics br br but wait for the eleven <UNK> highlights 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the washington <UNK> <UNK> br br i was well into the second act before i figured out these were supposed to be pro teams we were watching all clad in vintage brown and cameron diaz character's imitation of a youthful georgia was ill conceived on the page not your fault cameron would you like to go to dinner br br enough of this i'm only on a rant because i was looking forward to this film rent the longest yard instead br br
<START> or at least retirement this movie is awful horrible terrible rank rotten <UNK> well you get the idea do not under any circumstances watch this piece of <UNK> garbage unless you have a death wish because it's sure to kill you i only survived because i missed the first half hour <UNK> top is a bad comedian and an even worse actor i cannot believe he got anyone to <UNK> this huge waste of time and money it just goes to show that some people have no <UNK> if they think they might make a buck or two literally i can't imagine this made more than 2 br br and someone please tell me what possible motivation <UNK> <UNK> smith a halfway decent actress certainly above this at any rate had for <UNK> onto this steaming pile of dung was she that bored during that 3 5 second dry spell between <UNK> place and ally <UNK> or did she owe some kind of <UNK> debt to the most annoying person on the face of the planet aka <UNK> top br br i give this a 2 10 and that's probably way too high i try to save my for movies that make me vomit and since i didn't see all of this one my stomach <UNK> thankfully stayed contained i don't think i'll be watching it again to find out if it's really worth a 1
<START> real love true love mad love beautiful love ugly love dirty love sad love happy love silly love smart love gorgeous love dumb love love love love <UNK> moore understands that what she really needs is a man who trust her trust her and love her <UNK> of course when this man comes along she tries to run away but seymour wonderful seymour he <UNK> her he believes in her so he is going to fight for her against her i want to be like seymour <UNK> i want to be that kind of man a man willing to love without been afraid to fail but willing to fail that's a kind of hero that's my kind of hero and <UNK> moore is my kind of woman long live cassavetes and all his lovely bunch
<START> this movie was a low point for both jason <UNK> and sam <UNK> major plot points are taken directly from sergio <UNK> masterpiece once upon a time in the west released two years earlier and also featuring <UNK> a man finds a <UNK> hole is found in the desert being the only water for many miles in every direction he plans to build a <UNK> around the hole and to ensure there's a love interest he falls in love with a prostitute to this add an <UNK> preacher bad music silly fast action shots even <UNK> t a shots and there you go there is little question why it failed at the box office the real question is how did it make it that far
<START> i am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we won't know how it ends from the beginning i think <UNK> could do one hes <UNK> with animation this time i was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing br br joan cusack sucked she moved to a made for tv level <UNK> acting this one with cliched <UNK> the muppets were more life life than she was a disappointment br br but then the entire film was bar <UNK> i loved him he was the only one to ever get me laugh while as god got me <UNK> and <UNK> if we can't see a dark muppets than how about at least a pg 13 one with more of <UNK> controversial jokes and animals metal head egg <UNK> persona br br the worst muppets i saw even the boring christmas carol beats this one out the muppets need to avoid this over <UNK> holiday br br 5 10
<START> let's get right to the heart of the matter this is a terrible movie the story is confusing the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a <UNK> ellen <UNK> <UNK> the crimes and develops a crush on <UNK> wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when <UNK> and wilson kiss poor ellen looks like she's in pain <UNK> talent is totally wasted in this b grade <UNK> piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film
<START> working at a movie theater as a <UNK> i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out when i first saw the trailer for <UNK> snake i laughed and thought great another <UNK> on a <UNK> samuel l jackson movie but of course i wanted to see it for the laugh factor many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title the images on <UNK> ads and on the fact that justin timberlake is in the film personally i loved every second of this movie it tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another the story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live of course i do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from sam jackson christina <UNK> and yes even justin timberlake i encourage you to see <UNK> snake
<START> <UNK> girls is one of the funniest most clever sharp witted sarcastic and heart warming television shows i've ever watched second only to my most favorite television show of all time f r i e n d s the quick pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the you'll be hooked for life just some random comments i recently finally began watching season 6 and wow it's one of my favorite seasons so far i love the luke thing and all the drama in the various episodes is as always <UNK> the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions <UNK> has suddenly unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next br br a k a
<START> they have taken a story dear to the people of heart a true story and changed it as hollywood has done before to many a tale the end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate the original movie of this tale that walt disney himself <UNK> used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that john grey was anything special he was a poor shepard who died in poverty at the <UNK> if you like the story watch the disney original for a better heart warming story it's a shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale read the book for an accurate <UNK> of the story and if you really like it you can visit the real in <UNK>
<START> when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into this voyage he hardly knew who his father really was by the end of the film he found him and comes to terms with the strange life he lived as a child br br louis <UNK> was the father he was an architect his designs were perhaps too complex as he tried to create buildings that didn't <UNK> with <UNK> popular at that time it is ironic that he never achieved the fame that came so easy to some of his <UNK> he had a vision and he never <UNK> from it we can see characteristics of his unique style in the buildings he left behind as a legacy to humanity every one of his creations are unique in that they don't imitate works from other <UNK> br br louis <UNK> life was rather complicated he was married yet he had affairs with two of his <UNK> that produced a girl and a boy besides the legitimate daughter he had with his wife br br as a boy <UNK> <UNK> life was lived in a secluded area away from his father who only visited late at night louis <UNK> never recognized these children although it is very clear they all knew about the others existence br br it is tragic that louis <UNK> died alone in grand central station when he was returning from a trip without making peace with the women and children he never acknowledged as his own by his side he probably cared a great deal about all his children but he remains an <UNK> figure throughout the film we never get to know the man although at the end <UNK> in his quest to discover his father's life finds most of the missing pieces of the puzzle br br this is a personal account on the life of an artist thanks to that son who has the courage to tell the story we are almost <UNK> into the lives of louis <UNK> and his extended family
<START> last night i saw a peck on the cheek with english subtitles oddly it was <UNK> minutes long slightly longer than the time listed on imdb br br at first i found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me the context for what was occurring was missing and i am glad i stuck with it at the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native <UNK> <UNK> and the lovers are separated months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a <UNK> <UNK> heading to india at a <UNK> center you see the lady about to give birth after which the titles to the film finally are revealed br br the entire focus of the film then changes completely to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in <UNK> india you see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family none of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing what about the lady who was about to give birth my wife and i <UNK> this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad 2 though she did not realize these people were not her <UNK> parents br br soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints i had about the film as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her <UNK> and tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by <UNK> to help her find her <UNK> mother seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the <UNK> mother was impressive to watch and sure <UNK> my interest br br unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with <UNK> off and on for three decades the family's decision to look for the mom back in <UNK> <UNK> was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at times as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just <UNK> jumping into the middle of a war this was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the <UNK> parents first you tell her she isn't your <UNK> child and now you take her in the middle of a war zone sure the kid really wanted to meet her <UNK> mother but this really was stupid in <UNK> sight if it were me i might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid thus avoiding being in the middle of a war br br despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run also while i expected this because i have seen several indian films many <UNK> will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where this is standard in most films from india including those made in bollywood <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of especially since <UNK> the <UNK> had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies br br i was not disappointed with the results in fact i think this might be on a par with both romantic and entertaining and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe a pointless lesbian romp having been a fan of <UNK> <UNK> since seeing her <UNK> turn in journey i thought she <UNK> both hard deception and a growing <UNK> as <UNK> her transformation was believable and impressive to watch i <UNK> sally <UNK> as <UNK> blake from <UNK> the <UNK> a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue <UNK> her eyes were <UNK> conveying everything from rage to absolute despair the two of them acting together combining these talents made this drama <UNK> of course <UNK> <UNK> was amazing as usual she is <UNK> a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard even the direction from the fairly unknown <UNK> walsh used <UNK> yet beautiful shades of blue for <UNK> and brown for london br br however as much praise must be given to the script writer to turn a <UNK> page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour <UNK> is a huge feat he <UNK> the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back story and character development at the same time he has my full admiration br br in conclusion a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100 and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen
<START> while all of the <UNK> famous studios superman cartoons are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation plot and pacing why it wasn't even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for 1942 incredibly enough only the first one was in inexplicable br br here lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u s <UNK> masked gangsters in their super powered for 1942 car take off after the train determined to get that gold without giving too much away what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience with truth justice and superman <UNK> at the end br br as they did in all the <UNK> famous superman cartoons <UNK> bud <UNK> and joan alexander who played clark kent superman and lois lane on radio have the voice work <UNK> here and <UNK> <UNK> jack <UNK> gets a little to do as one of the bad guys as well
<START> this was a bold movie to hit indian cinemas when it was released the first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian <UNK> amongst indian women the leading actress of indian cinema <UNK> <UNK> added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie <UNK> with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible the sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie the scene where <UNK> <UNK> loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in indian cinemas br br good acting by all the actors especially <UNK> <UNK> amidst criticism from the indian public
<START> there are many things to admire about this film but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric <UNK> the sort of role that hollywood loves but which here is absolutely convincing unlike any character i've in film or in life also a very convincing disturbing depiction of syndrome
<START> this film should be called adventures in <UNK> it is like the screenwriter and director the <UNK> notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the italian <UNK> rock hudson is pretty good here but the dialogue bears no resemblance to <UNK> at all this is a made up version of <UNK> <UNK> the screenwriter is a hack watch the 1932 version with gary cooper and helen hayes that is great cinema and was made by someone who understood <UNK> and the war in northern italy gary cooper is very very good compared to his performance in for whom the bell <UNK> where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western br br anyway if you are a <UNK> fan do yourself a favor and do not watch this film your best bet is to get the <UNK> audio cd and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written
<START> this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket what these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking rather they just chose sixteen students of some diversity though not quite as much diversity as the reviews have suggested and set them loose the results are to be brutally frank far more often boring self indulgent overwrought and off <UNK> grainy than truly insightful br br there are of course moments of recognition and <UNK> of the sort only possible in documentary film but overall there's not much more truth here than in bully or for that matter a decent tv documentary of the same sort though full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism the film brings nothing to the table that will be of use to anyone who has thought about any of these issues with any seriousness and while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to <UNK> a bit of admittedly welcome comic relief most often the five minute limit keeps up from becoming emotionally involved with any of the students an interesting idea but thumbs down for chain camera
<START> two l a cops track down a serial killer <UNK> the family man who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police <UNK> wife takes the deep six questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather <UNK> the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than ridiculous also a running joke involves enjoyment of eating <UNK> deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage due to a boy's <UNK> with his girlfriend after seagal him the girlfriend tells the young <UNK> that she loves him now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this if you want your girlfriend back taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work then again though i'm old fashioned besides who am i to put a <UNK> on somebody else's brilliant <UNK> plan br br out of 4 bad
<START> first i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than the da <UNK> code sure you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well one scene particularly that involves fire i found extremely well done br br second the changes from book to film although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete <UNK> of others i gotta admit i was wrong it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in da <UNK> if you are a <UNK> of the book some of them may upset you though however the big twist is still there so don't worry about that finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of <UNK> and getting together br br the performances are really good but nothing out of the ordinary that's okay for a film like this br br i'd give it a 9 10 mainly because it delivers what it promises entertainment pure entertainment
<START> <UNK> an elegant and pretty young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her <UNK> and depression although she may have a one night lover or if someone lives with her it makes no difference of being completely alone <UNK> is also a passionate woman who can take actions to approach that special man <UNK> and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with a yes no or i don't know the way to accent the loneliness of the character is magnificent an example would be the distance of both <UNK> and <UNK> taking a coffee in the same room separated by subtle <UNK> and not seeing each other i could mention several sequences however it is better to see the movie it is impressive to watch that not a single detail is out of control by the director although all actions are performed in slow movements no shouts are necessary not special effects but only great acting and a touching well written story i loved it
<START> look at the all the positive user comments of this movie then check to see how often each one <UNK> user comments they post once it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro movie comments on imdb br br this movie was awful the plot was stupid the acting was poor the jokes weren't even funny the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters br br it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and <UNK> rumors this isn't even done well every joke is obvious and you see it coming br br the movie is worthy of fast <UNK> or better yet not watching br br i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and <UNK> for 1 5 <UNK> they stole from me i would
<START> i first heard of this movie at the flashback weekend in chicago 2007 for the nightmare on elm street robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of <UNK> the same can be said for tony todd knowing this is a low budget first time director writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden 2007 remake re imagining br br technically it falls short in a couple of places the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp on to the black pants became almost invisible the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and <UNK> like a bad sitcom and just like 2007 someone is smart enough to have a gun but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer the ending well as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen not very original br br the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions unlike 2007 we got to meet the people and care what happened to them ben joel moore who is also the lead of spiral the <UNK> lead and marcus not another teen movie as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie <UNK> joel <UNK> <UNK> greg jenna and misty <UNK> <UNK> of buffy the vampire <UNK> the series angel the series and the <UNK> family movies give a convoluted reason for topless women mr and mrs played by television <UNK> richard grounded for life step by step as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance even the tour guide shawn <UNK> <UNK> is a fleshed out character i hope to see more from all involved in this film but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater sorry
<START> this sequel is brilliant and is the last film donald <UNK> dr <UNK> worked on before his death i loved the new direction the film took with the story instead of just michael myers wanting to kill his family i love this whole series and apart from the first and second movies this is by far the best
<START> at my local video rental store they have a special place for two girls and a guy it's a long running joke really the clerk lets people rent it for free they value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money on it br br i was extremely surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review maybe someone can explain it to me or maybe the positive comments were jokes did people involved with the movie write them perhaps the mother of the director writer br br maybe i've just seen so many good movies that this one fails in comparison
<START> this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen i would think you could get that from the title also there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film i can't even remember why i saw this film or when only that is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience on the other hand if you are looking for the absolute <UNK> movie to waste two hours of your time then by all means rent it good luck finding it at your local store though i doubt this movie is in a very wide distribution and please do not show this to children by any means as it may <UNK> their <UNK> minds forever
<START> from the director of <UNK> comes this slick vampire flick <UNK> ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being <UNK> of a deadly mysterious virus his <UNK> and <UNK> are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the <UNK> blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some blood because of his supposedly <UNK> survival he comes into the lives of ha <UNK> <UNK> family shin has cancer and his mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help but fall for <UNK> young wife ok <UNK> kim kim is intensely interested in the world of <UNK> and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the medium of cinema my god i've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers the major flaw of the film is that it's a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also <UNK> hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok <UNK> kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year
<START> of all the e r <UNK> screen adaptations that doug <UNK> starred in the 70s this is the of all it's so <UNK> you can taste the dust of the sets and feel the heath of the <UNK> above the thing looks like a very very big budget school play or indeed a very very low budget action movie which it actually is it's been said on many occasions that this was the last of the genre entries and i do hope it was the genre didn't die <UNK> but in horrible agony amidst a lot of smoke fake blood and lousy sound effects peter cushing must have felt a boy again as a nutty professor whose shirt stays white as snow after the gentlemen has dragged himself through the slimy crap holes of the underworld what a sport he was to accept a part in this <UNK> and carry it so <UNK> br br shot entirely on a sound stage and accompanied by then trendy now unbearable <UNK> soundtrack the main anti attraction of this film are the cardboard monsters yes there are always monsters like that in a <UNK> adaptation but they rarely manage to be so completely ridiculous helpless or void of any credibility on a few occasions during the <UNK> action combat scenes where mr <UNK> <UNK> attacks the creatures you can almost hear the empty hollow sound as his head <UNK> against the side of a fortunately the animals explode and go up in flames the minute they trip and fell over indeed there is a great deal of <UNK> exploding as the film and the genre draws towards the finale and lovely miss <UNK> loses her accent br br the triple bill currently on the market features this film plus two others the land that time forgot and the war <UNK> of atlantis the first two are quite strong entries especially the first one with a lot of money invested and occasionally even fascinating script turns don't expect any of these qualities from this film get drunk with pals and laugh shamelessly at what you see after all the makers didn't have any shame either
<START> bad acting <UNK> are very awful 3 4 second between each text bad music bad effect and always the same plan during the movie if you want laugh go it 2 10 for the fool laugh
<START> while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography i thought a more <UNK> approach would have better supported the low fi home movie feel i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent dean bell has crafted a real gem that <UNK> charms with character driven delight her performance of sandra is a pleasure unfolding alternately as diabolical and romantic we are at once intrigued and <UNK> by her actions and never given more information than is necessary <UNK> and the supporting <UNK> efforts meet <UNK> post modern fairy tale with arms wide open emily <UNK> alice is <UNK> with a eyed magic she seems to mold like clay before us <UNK> into some sort of beautiful lost beast by the end we are at odds with words as she is saying goodbye to her mother kudos also should be <UNK> out to jane lincoln taylor whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight and justin <UNK> whose shy first time john sam provides one of the <UNK> if not most awkward sex scenes in film bell has created a first rate story and assembled a <UNK> of talent to make it
<START> what could ever happen in a dull <UNK> town in summer well a bunch of teenagers find out a few things can and do happen br br it turns out the mexican werewolf of this story is nothing less than el and the movie unlike the name would suggest is not a remake or <UNK> of the american werewolf movies but something completely different br br overall for an obviously low budget movie it's not bad some clever camera work quite decent looking traditional creature and gore effects and for once not all knowing people that can and do make mistakes like shooting a colleague thinking it's the big bad beast and are <UNK> by things they could not possibly know br br sit down at this expecting a blockbuster million dollar production and you will turn it off in disgust after a short while sit down at this expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story and it's quite good overall it gets an 8 10 from me for being creative having ok acting and pulling off some good work for the budget this movie had
<START> being a completely broke film buff with a house to <UNK> i'm a big fan of <UNK> my whole <UNK> practically is packed to the <UNK> with the cheap <UNK> board stuff and you know how all those stylish household items at <UNK> have those funny names a called and a bathroom mirror called a well it just adds to the whole euro charm br br like those interestingly named but horribly translated items on the shelves at <UNK> i'd like to provide a bit of translation to some of the reviews i've read about the swedish made br br original comment for a low budget film this is pretty cool stuff it would be great to see what these guys could do on a hollywood budget br br translation the film stock is crappy the lighting is pedestrian the cinematography is uninteresting the sound recording is hollow br br original comment david sci fi drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters br br translation these actors are acting for free the storyline is <UNK> and <UNK> the ideas that the flick desperately try to be existential but are simply mundane and the settings especially the interiors are dull and filled with ugly <UNK> br br original comment the editing is well done and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling cgi effects don't have to come out of a hollywood studio br br translation when you've got <UNK> cinematography to begin with hide the <UNK> by <UNK> all of it onto a mac and <UNK> <UNK> for three minutes ingenious br br i took a chance on this dvd because i'm a sucker for independent films especially those that attempt to tackle the often expensive and awe inspiring genre of science fiction i mean some of the best sci fi flicks of all time have been realized with little or no budget and actors take peter <UNK> <UNK> warning time travel flick <UNK> transfer for example a classic br br but doesn't fit the category of carefully crafted low key idea <UNK> sci fi it relentlessly focuses on characters that don't do much and don't say interesting things it goes round and round in circles it is much too long this coming from a major <UNK> fan worse its concept of reality shifting aliens is twilight zone fodder from 40 years ago it's just not a well made film and i really wanted it to be <UNK> br br however being the <UNK> fan i am i did make one ground shattering observation first anyone who has <UNK> at <UNK> knows how their <UNK> shopping <UNK> work all four <UNK> being the <UNK> can spin a perfect <UNK> degrees and it takes some <UNK> to handle them like a pro as any avid <UNK> <UNK> knows well i'll be damned but one of the lead actresses in goes to some <UNK> <UNK> store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing around a shopping <UNK> so that's not an <UNK> invention after all but is yet another wonderful invention let's call it a for the hell of it from the land of doo
<START> i can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews the film is dated of course and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now but even allowing for this helen of <UNK> is so bad that it is almost laughable br br the scripting is awful just awful with no characterisation at all the performances suffer as a result you can see the likes of <UNK> and andrews <UNK> in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite <UNK> lines the writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful <UNK> screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for him herself at all the beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient <UNK> i know they had american audiences to take into consideration but the <UNK> way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful br br i honestly can't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film even allowing for the <UNK> primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience this movie truly stinks
<START> the <UNK> laura <UNK> appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the french <UNK> 2 this amazing woman did not go <UNK> and was soon cast as the lead in this all new italian series where she is the <UNK> a beautiful <UNK> who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious <UNK> that the world had to offer in this first installment mae jordan <UNK> is sent to africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals much like sylvia character <UNK> has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality this first film is basically about how she becomes the <UNK> that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with filled with gorgeous cinematography beautiful people and an <UNK> 70's score from the legendary <UNK> this one is sure to please those who enjoy the more story driven style of the original french <UNK> should definitely like this as well the main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a <UNK> playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him sexy fun and totally entertaining throughout a soap opera to be sure but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained for some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on dvd there has never been a legitimate dvd for this which is very strange the <UNK> that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release
<START> this movie is one of the worse movies of all time i'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100 it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list this isn't just a film i think is bad in a campy fun sort of mst3k way it's just bad this is one of the few films that i really really hate freddy got <UNK> is in the same category of bad br br so the story in this one goes that the daughter goes to california to go to school and comes back with crawl shore and he tries to learn to be a farmer then the boyfriend tries to set shore up so that the girl will leave crawl and go back to him it ends and what's left of the audience can leave br br the main purpose of this movie is for <UNK> shore to <UNK> for the camera and try to be funny but i'd say about 100 of the time he fails at that their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of <UNK> and <UNK> is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing if you think of seeing it don't the one time i saw the movie it felt like i was watching it for 5 or 6 hours if you've already seen it you have my sympathy
<START> i can't believe this isn't a huge cult hit perhaps people in 1968 thinking of the <UNK> as a silly factory made pop band rip off of the beatles refused to see it that cynicism probably covered it from sight ever since don't make this mistake head is an amazing film that most open minded people will appreciate it is very funny and very intelligent and very <UNK>
<START> i've been waiting since last october to see this film it was supposed to come out october <UNK> and now i've finally seen it i am not disappointed bloody marvellous ok it was a tad slow in the beginning but once it got going it's a very exciting nail biting tense robert <UNK> is so different from either <UNK> in 'the full and in <UNK> that it's hard to <UNK> him and johnny lee miller no longer with his sick boy from <UNK> blond hair plays his dashing gentlemen highway man with the right about of humour and sensitivity that it is easy to see why <UNK> rebecca falls for him a great film as <UNK> in disney's would say two thumbs way way up
<START> a movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do i think movie goers in general are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most <UNK> reasons just watch a couple minutes of massacre and trust me you'll change your views a <UNK> would be almost a compliment for these no talent actors but then again it's a jim <UNK> film <UNK> is a popular director of these ultra low budget b movies having worked with roger corman on many an occasion the problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot and when you have actors delivering lines like they're reading letters off an eye <UNK> how am i supposed to care in bare <UNK> 2 he didn't try to develop a plot he simply tried to make a <UNK> porn goofy <UNK> on the blair witch project it was fun and it was <UNK> <UNK> is no fun there are a couple obligatory female nude scenes but they are few and far between so it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level i must say the worst scene is the one where <UNK> fritz walks across a bridge that's about to collapse first of all her character didn't have to walk across that bridge second of all as the bridge starts <UNK> rather than try her best to run across she just stands there and acts helpless and top it off we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars unlike a lot of b horror films this one's actually boring and that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies one of the few bright spots was <UNK> johnson who's probably the most natural actor in the film though certainly no more than halfway decent he was funny in bare <UNK> 2 and had some funny scenes in this movie too
<START> it is hard to judge <UNK> without referring to the fact that director and script writer dan harris is only 25 you can hardly believe seeing this film which is not only a mature piece of work professional and deep but also with some of the <UNK> of routine specific to older directors br br the setting is the american <UNK> too familiar from <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> as in <UNK> film turns around a suicide but here it happens at the beginning of the movie and we are left watching a mid class family <UNK> with the death of the gifted <UNK> brother and son <UNK> <UNK> plays the younger brother <UNK> weaver is the mother both are excellent trying to cope with the loss to find the reason and motivation to survive harris drives his actors with a sure hand and the first two sections of the film there are four in total as the seasons of the year build a wonderful tension with credible <UNK> and real questions it is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly it looks too tired and conventional and i suspect that the producers may have <UNK> in the work of the young script writer and director trying to bring him closer to the hollywood convention that's how this film fails to be a somber version of <UNK> <UNK> with a different focus i am sure however that we will hear a lot about dan harris in the coming years
<START> i had been waiting to see this movie for so long and finally got to yesterday in summary i'm glad i finally did the humor is off the wall hilarious the plot is so unbelievably believable that it has to have at least some truth for it if anything stood out in this movie it is most definitely the coffee shop scene i have been there every guy has you get dumped you find out that your ex has fooled around with some guy who you are sure is an <UNK> now every time you see anything for the next few days you just get horrible thoughts of this placed in all the wrong areas she is <UNK> everyone and everyone knows it i could probably watch that man <UNK> and finger his <UNK> all day long and look back at myself and laugh for having been there too
<START> watching john cassavetes debut film is a strange experience even if you've seen <UNK> films before br br the first thing you notice is it's <UNK> right off it's obvious some of the characters are <UNK> up their lines but then you step back from the situation as you sink deeper into these people's intimate <UNK> and you ask yourself do i ever stumble over my words the answer of course is sure we all do it's unfortunate that most of the <UNK> in this respect come early in the picture because by about twenty minutes you've sunk so deep in you wouldn't know it if a bomb went off behind you br br the next thing you notice or maybe you notice it hours or days after the film ends is that you never saw any substantial plot yet the themes and the poetry of the dialog and characters never leave you in fact the treatment of the role race plays in the everyday lives of these characters is always there but it's so <UNK> that even they aren't aware of how it's <UNK> their opinions of themselves their self consciousness their perceived status or the fate of their relationships br br the title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks whites and <UNK> and not just in the skin of the characters <UNK> <UNK> truly remarkable here is an <UNK> american <UNK> her two brothers are white and dark <UNK> american the irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the <UNK> most <UNK> atmosphere of the time beat driven upper east west <UNK> and there are still conflicts within and around themselves br br i don't think i've ever seen a movie with such a subtle delivery or technique it's a lot like absorbing a really great piece of gallery art and then just <UNK> off in bliss as you think back to the images it <UNK> days later br br great <UNK> and extras on the <UNK> disc arguably the first truly experimental independent film ever made
<START> on more than one level i can relate to what happens in this movie in a very personal way and all i can say about it is that it's true what <UNK> mom tells eric at the end of the story he actually did her son by taking away his sad feelings and his loneliness br br this movie emphasis a philosophy i can very well agree with we are all going to die one day sooner or later in the end it is not the amount of time we live but the fun good times happiness we have during that time it is not the <UNK> but the quality that counts br br i guess all other words used here would only keep you any longer from getting to see this movie if you haven't already i really would like to see it released on dvd definitely it would be added to my <UNK> time right away
<START> grave <UNK> is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk wishing to take down his last words for <UNK> and as a warning to others about the horrible life he lead at first reluctant but with his tongue <UNK> up by drink the young grave <UNK> is soon telling his story which is full of the dead the undead and things that go <UNK> in the night br br new york <UNK> horror film filmed in part on <UNK> island which no doubt brought the spirit of andy <UNK> lurking about is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while this is an often very funny film that just <UNK> its story out in every which way the cast is first rate dominic <UNK> plays arthur blake the grave <UNK> telling his story ron <UNK> is father <UNK> the monk taking the statement and perhaps getting too involved in the tale both men are clearly having a grand old time and it shows the rest of the cast is equally as good the music by jeff grace is excellent the effects are perfect for this sort of <UNK> silliness the film is a great deal of fun if there is any trouble with the film its that perhaps it throws its net a little wide so as the result has way too much going on i don't want to give too much away but i don't think we needed the alien body in the mix still this is a great deal of fun and its one i'm pretty sure i will <UNK> on the <UNK> in theaters where i saw it the first time and later on i'm sure i'll pick up the dvd br br worth a look
<START> jack frost 2 is probably the most <UNK> movie i have ever seen in my life the complete title of the film is jack frost 2 revenge of the mutant killer snowman horror movie fans that have a taste for campy story lines will be delighted to watch this this film was straight to video and for good reasons here's why the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could cause one to cry the main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse the screenplay was was also atrocious each character always says a cheesy line and add the cheesy lines to the bad choreography then you have something bad second the story line isn't really all that impressive but since this movie was straight to video it is forgiven the director and writer could have turned the idea of a killer snowman into something cool but they didn't they story has lots of plot holes in it in the beginning a cup of coffee gets knocked into the fish tank with the <UNK> jack frost scientists try to <UNK> his life but they couldn't once the cup of coffee fell into the tank jack frost was completely restored now he is <UNK> to anti freeze in jack frost part 1 the main character's <UNK> got mixed up with the anti freeze that was used to kill jack frost since the main character is <UNK> to <UNK> jack frost is too hence here's my point they say that <UNK> <UNK> combined with jack <UNK> but one of the scientists had some <UNK> on the cup so when it fell into the tank the scientists <UNK> would have been combined with jack another thing the special effects weren't very good either here's the good points jack frost 2 has lots of blood that looks pretty realistic even though this movie is flawed to hell it is still entertaining overall jack frost 2 is an enjoyable horror movie the first one was better though 7 out of 10
<START> slasher sequel fourth <UNK> part massacre film concerns a group of <UNK> <UNK> stranded in a <UNK> cabin in the snow being <UNK> by a deranged killer typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans gore wonderfully gratuitous female nudity no plot though it wears out its welcome eventually even at its short length br br original star <UNK> stevens makes a cameo which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie
<START> this is one of my favourite films dating back to my childhood set in the remote wilderness of <UNK> at the turn of the century a small community is <UNK> when an extremely cold winter forces two <UNK> to come down from the mountains in search of food <UNK> on <UNK> in this atmosphere we are introduced to a <UNK> fur <UNK> who lives out in the <UNK> as he comes to the village to sell his <UNK> catch to boris his close and rather only friend in the village who runs a store at <UNK> request <UNK> his friend's arrogant son <UNK> on the hunt for the menacing <UNK> personalities crash and <UNK> <UNK> as the older more experienced <UNK> amateur methods an encounter noticed also by the other members of the hunt on the second day the hunters sight their prey and give chase in a thick wood <UNK> wounds one of the <UNK> which then attacks the hapless man seeing <UNK> with the <UNK> beast fires but <UNK> hits <UNK> he kills the tiger as it <UNK> the other hunters arrive on the scene suspicious br br back in the village the doctor works to save the wounded <UNK> attempts to leave the village but is confronted by friends the <UNK> <UNK> them off however and <UNK> off with his dog drawn <UNK> the young villagers swear after him that they'll come for him if <UNK> dies which he later does but before dying explains to his father that it was an accident old boris upon learning of his close friend being run out of the village <UNK> out the gathering lynch mob and goes out after to find him and set things right and so the main story begins br br a simple film it raises the conflict of man and <UNK> versus nature mainly struggle to survive alone out in the wilderness the winter landscape is very well filmed perhaps the strongest element in the film is the soundtrack by <UNK> <UNK> very sentimental and <UNK> the main theme reminiscent of <UNK> other movements reflect russian styles as well as a couple of folk music type tunes br br unfortunately this film is not available to buy to my knowledge which is rather a shame the copy i own recorded off tv nearly twenty years ago is slowly <UNK> this film is a must see for those who can appreciate it if they can find it 8 10
<START> forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book so what this is a film after all it is a sheer joy to watch made entirely on location in gorgeous photography but with dark disturbing moments as well the only problem i have is with the obvious <UNK> of nicolas cage as captain apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise
<START> this movie was <UNK> awful the sound was terrible the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating if you have a life don't see this movie cause you will want to kill yourself this movie totally rips off blade which is undoubtedly a really good movie or trilogy i should say br br i don't care who the actors are this movie is just horrible i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is i actually don't know why my family is still watching it oh wait yes i do they are laughing almost non stop at the stupid action dialogue and acting
<START> one of the funniest films i ever saw in the theater back in the early '70s and sadly it's only been on tv a few times since this movie should be released on video it's sellers at his <UNK> <UNK> best as a crooked hospital <UNK> great cast great movie if anyone has a good vhs copy i'd love to buy it
<START> okay granted i am a fan of low budget horror which along with it does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most <UNK> fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to <UNK> 6 directed by jay br br first of all the <UNK> series started back in the mid 80s by charlie band and his empire pictures is basically the franchise that it is because of tim <UNK> and his excellent portrayal of <UNK> hunter jack <UNK> well low and behold due to the sinking budgets of full moon features which despite what people have said have actually brought along very high quality features such as hell asylum and dead rotting <UNK> did not return for the sixth installment br br full moon writer <UNK> <UNK> returns once again and delivers another below average screenplay which features jack <UNK> played by <UNK> in flashbacks which are extremely poorly inserted he has a different hair style like every time he is shown and some laying on a table going down the line into his daughter's body well from here on out you have jo <UNK> acting like jack but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as jack <UNK> did br br the film shot on <UNK> is simply put an embarrassment to the <UNK> name no offense to anyone at young wolf productions i mean i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a <UNK> film without tim but with a little more time despite it being filmed since december of 2001 it could have been better br br however check out full <UNK> dvd of it which is a double feature with the original <UNK> and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features br br overall i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the <UNK> name but like anything you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself
<START> i see that c thomas <UNK> has appeared in many movies since his <UNK> in the 80s as an accomplished young actor br br i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c thomas <UNK> is i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the 1980s br br in just a few words what a very big disappointment i give some low budget movies a chance but this one started out lame within the first 15 minutes of the movie this <UNK> woman is <UNK> with an asian guy in a they basically <UNK> themselves to their own chat she then insists on meeting the <UNK> in person she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood the plot then <UNK> further br br the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff do not bother renting it much less <UNK> it even if it is in the 1 dvd bin i plan to take my copy of the dvd to <UNK> i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
<START> don't ask me why i love this movie so much maybe it came at a time in my life i desperately wanted to fit in maybe it is the amazing monster effects maybe because i enjoyed the novel <UNK> but it's probably because i love clive barker i think it's fair to warn you the movie and the novel have no true resolve and like me you'll probably have a wtf moment at the end at least two sequels were planned but never came about due to the fact the movie <UNK> for a few reasons the studio made <UNK> cuts to the film cutting a good 30 or so minutes out of it and they did a horrible job promoting it the <UNK> made it look like just another cheap slasher showing mainly the button face mask <UNK> character this is a movie about the monsters about fantasy about a place called it's a story where the monsters are the good guys there is truly nothing else out there like it it's not a movie for everybody i suppose but it stands as one of <UNK> many great works sit back and be prepared to be taken to where the monsters are
<START> i give this piece of hollywood trash 1 out 10 seriously i mean i like comedy as much as the next guy i also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it but this film had nothing to laugh at or with br br i like nearly all of the actors in this film so i thought i'd overlook what many people told me about it my fault for not listening i was just <UNK> at how stupid this script was just ridiculous and not even in a funny way the only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on tv i was very disappointed and i really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it bad decision on their parts br br major spoiler br br okay here's my biggest question on this film if the characters are looking back on this story of jewel <UNK> tyler after the fact then how can paul reiser have gone to a <UNK> remembering the past he dies in the last scene by being crushed by the <UNK> can anyone answer me that major goof on the part of the film makers nobody noticed this
<START> in <UNK> the former blues man <UNK> samuel l jackson is in crisis missing his wife that has just left him he finds the town slut and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dumped on the road nearby his little farm drugged beaten and almost dead <UNK> brings her home giving medicine and <UNK> and <UNK> her like a father keeping her <UNK> to control her heat when her boyfriend <UNK> justin timberlake is <UNK> from the army due to his anxiety issue he <UNK> the relationship of <UNK> and <UNK> and tries to kill him br br black snake <UNK> is a weird tale of faith hope love and blues the gifted christina <UNK> has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp abused since her childhood by her father and having had sex with the whole town where she lives it is amazing the <UNK> of this actress and probably this is the most mature work that i have seen christina <UNK> perform samuel l jackson has also a fantastic performance in the role of <UNK> the soundtrack is one of the most beautiful i have ever heard in a movie with wonderful blues my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> o e o <UNK> between the heaven and the hell
<START> that's right the painter and the main character is an exceptional person what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there and the message is sad it says that it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to <UNK> the <UNK> establishment and other of this world and even if you try you might not be able to bear it it is about the battle of a single person with a system with many systems br br a great film of this wonderful korean director please see it if you do have an opportunity
<START> stars hayden br br there have been so many movies that have this exact same plot and this one is just a poor <UNK> of it white girl moves to ethnic school doesn't fit in soon becomes accepted originality is nonexistent in this and neither are the laughs it uses so many old poorly executed jokes it's annoying i don't know why they think it's a good idea to make made for video sequels to mediocre films but it isn't with that said the <UNK> in this are that all the people in it are fairly competent actors and actresses br br my rating out of pg 13 for language and sexual humor
<START> it's a super movie i only seen it once but it's very good if you like music like in and don't have problem with drugs it's fantastic movie it's only a little bit to short but when you watch the movie make sure your sound system is at 100 then you will love the music in the film and the funny things that a guy from the country comes never drink any alcohol and then he is under drugs in the biggest and love the music br br the only problem is that i want to buy it and i can't find it so if anyone knows where i could buy the movie <UNK> mail me br br <UNK> me from holland br br <UNK> <UNK> me
<START> this is without a doubt one of the most accomplished debut films for any director the movie is only 90 minutes long but manages to say just about everything about life and death not much action and dialogue is minimal but the movie flows perfectly and demands your attention due to the wonderfully natural feel of everything going on the performances by the leads are perfection and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes the movie will be somewhat lost on today's modern audience but this is one that everyone ought to see <UNK> <UNK> and honest this is on par with <UNK> works br br scratch my title this one is perfect
<START> i have <UNK> my brain for another film that reminds me of this one i really can't come up with one i think it's because most of the films that take on this topic war peace violence are in a fixed documentary style there are some terrific ones out there all of them better known than usa t m i'm sure but they are intended to be <UNK> and to bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means this dvd in some ways may seem more intellectual but it really isn't it is philosophical maybe but it <UNK> the information mode and goes directly to the same place that a piece of music does it makes you feel but sometimes you don't even know why you are just taken somewhere on a wave of feeling when you watch it notice how well it is put together it may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who look for a rare cinematic creation that respects you
<START> really is this necessary how can somebody make such a film disgusting seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant stunts all the time cars <UNK> with an annoying soundtrack not to mention the ending completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl br br steven seagal wants to be robin hood well at the beginning a fortune <UNK> answers something nobody has asked <UNK> wife has nightmares and she can see the future they must be kidding steven segal passes out after a car <UNK> and i know he can't act it was terrible nothing can save that film br br i lost 90 minutes of my life see you
<START> i simply cannot understand how any who fan or just plain anyone could find this awful lazy poorly written abomination even remotely funny it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy the potential for this was huge it could have been great what a shame that all that acting talent the sets the props the <UNK> of everyone involved was so <UNK> wasted by a script that should have been burned br br there is an obvious lack of any <UNK> production and quality control here like those hammy hollywood movies mad mad mad world casino <UNK> where the stars are just <UNK> for each other and <UNK> a great <UNK> which basically means picking up a <UNK> for doing nothing br br i could have written a better who send up in my sleep in fact i have while awake though i did it in year 10 in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates it was better i look at it now and the gags are funnier steven <UNK> you are a no talent bum what a waste what a wasted opportunity makes me want to cry
<START> after seeing <UNK> 2 i knew what to expect from <UNK> <UNK> br br the shepherd border <UNK> is a decent flick not van <UNK> best but definitely not his worst there is some bad acting from supporting cast but it makes sense br br the storyline and plot has all been done before so it's nothing new i mean this is van damme we don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we so lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway the fighting br br without giving anything away i thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done way better than a few of recent movies such as second in command in which the entire end fight is horrible with <UNK> behind the camera and if you've seen <UNK> 2 he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it a few of the fights in the shepherd reminded me of older stuff which is what we all want to see the fights were good and i said <UNK> awesome out loud a few times but i was hoping for just a bit more considering how good i thought <UNK> 2 was br br something i found intriguing was daughter in the film i thought wow she's kinda hot come to find out its <UNK> van real life daughter i have never seen her before so that was a nice treat br br all in all this movie is not half bad yeah the story has been done before but at least <UNK> was attempting to make a good movie next time though add more hand to hand combat i think he still has what it takes to do another big budget movie his acting has improved since he's been doing and he really is in great shape at <UNK> i don't know about you but i'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his are actually good with the exception of <UNK> all he needs to do is get back into <UNK> shape and make a martial arts movie and i think people would respond well even though he's not jet li this movie is definitely worth the rental
<START> many of us find art <UNK> only when the masterpiece itself touches something deep inside us that is the completed creation can only be accepted and appreciated if we can somehow personally relate to it it was winter here in australia 1992 when i had seen batman returns at the cinemas and it blew me away both <UNK> i was supposed to belong to an ideal a standard but at the same time i was living another life tim burton was the first film maker to say its ok for a comic movie to be dark and to confess that darkness can happen to us all after tim <UNK> batman interpretations many other dark comic book heroes and anti heroes <UNK> the cinemas comic book <UNK> for decades had told of friendly likable heroes with <UNK> handsome smiles and magical <UNK> who fly in the sky and <UNK> powerful <UNK> from their <UNK> and wore red boots and had the strength of a <UNK> but what happens when you are only ten years old and you see your parents <UNK> executed in front of your very eyes you snap somewhere in your psyche your young tender psychological make up breaks apart the only way such pain and hurt can be managed is to create an alternate persona you make a promise your other self will be stronger <UNK> all the anger all the rage to use whatever means available to avenge the innocence of your parents onto that criminal those criminals any criminal this is life seen through bruce wayne's eyes both <UNK> the world he sees is dark gloomy and cold although he <UNK> the streets and people hear him cruise by they don't rush out to get his <UNK> he is their <UNK> not the winner of a personality contest batman returns is about losers batman for yet another christmas remains the only lonely man beast in town bruce wayne never gets to arrest the vile max the penguin never gets to <UNK> his pain of being <UNK> by his parents onto the citizens of <UNK> and <UNK> kyle is forever lost to being mentally <UNK> and traumatized and the hero doesn't get the girl or cat this movie <UNK> into the desire in all of us to want so desperately to belong to have a home as expressed by bruce wayne and <UNK> <UNK> the film brings out a need in all of us to be heard respected and not ignored as desired by <UNK> kyle <UNK> and of course bruce wayne but sometimes we are all <UNK> in one way or another we are told to be an ideal to behave to a certain standard that is until we finally snap only hope remains at the end of the movie as we see <UNK> rise towards the night sky but come what may we all must wish good will towards all men and women as for me i cant say that i will reach a point where i will believe my problem with <UNK> will be <UNK> but thats ok we all have a dark side batman returns is not only the best of the batman films it is truly a stand out exceptionally fine masterpiece of storytelling
<START> betty is as an in a production of <UNK> <UNK> who is asked to go on when the <UNK> is hurt in a car accident however in the grand tradition of the scottish play the production seems cursed with problems not least of which is some madman <UNK> up the crew unfortunately for betty the killer seems to have special plans for her br br this is one of several must see <UNK> mad slasher flicks in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman <UNK> taylor i haven't <UNK> it but i <UNK> around two thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans tracking or <UNK> the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller the imagery is wild and <UNK> closeups of the <UNK> eyes forced open with nails a <UNK> <UNK> around an opera house from a point of view shots of the killer's brain <UNK> a bullet fired through a <UNK> a <UNK> chain <UNK> out of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director the movie isn't without some shortcomings though the cast are <UNK> at best and are both a bit shaky and his dubbing in the english version is appalling even by italian standards although <UNK> regular is fun and <UNK> gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little <UNK> a horror director much <UNK> for his <UNK> and <UNK> on technique the material is a nice three way mix of the phantom of the opera shakespeare and slasher flick scripted by <UNK> and his usual <UNK> franco with <UNK> suspects <UNK> and the usual disdain for boring <UNK> scenes to explain what's actually going on full of all sorts of different music brian <UNK> bill <UNK> and of course <UNK> the scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the in for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera
<START> the movie starts out a bit interested with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age <UNK> appearing husband is killed in car crash as she is getting ready to go to rome and sing as a <UNK> matthew objects but comes along he <UNK> with the young girl again but this time matt is on cocaine his superb voice lovely <UNK> mother is in the <UNK> she doesn't know how to handle <UNK> addiction the movie drags on in search of a plot <UNK> is in the wrong role and <UNK> may have had his head in the moon while directing the picture the moon has great symbolism br br save your time i am perhaps overly generous with 4
<START> i loved this movie not as great as 50 first dates but it's definitely a especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends yes the plot was cute and maybe even unbelievable but what's so bad about a feel good movie drew as <UNK> and her romance with the teacher is so sweet and brother baseball <UNK> adds to the movie's good feeling with all the junk out there what's so bad about a good movie the whole family can enjoy without being embarrassed while watching with your kids drew is an awesome actress that really seems to be <UNK> for the most part this is definitely one of her best roles
<START> is one of most political movies it takes stance strongly against modern day <UNK> authority status in the life of the common man and how it has estranged men from the nature completely it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our <UNK> society br br <UNK> buy the <UNK> jungle with all its rules and <UNK> tries to <UNK> the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern <UNK> only to realize that the concept of a <UNK> <UNK> isn't all that <UNK> in other words the society has the common man by the balls br br still the thing that makes so exceptional besides the visual and brilliance is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in <UNK> in the 70's as well as the whole identity of <UNK> as a nation is like an <UNK> of a classical <UNK> in his and social since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us <UNK> the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes emotionally exceptionally moving
<START> i was living in <UNK> in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane played an poor attempt of bonnie and clyde needless to say it never went over well maybe this is why it never made it to video even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie the movie was dull and pretty much pointless by the way dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down
<START> i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film <UNK> fell flat as hey come on tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context it's a good looking film but lacks punch when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small <UNK> he looks uncomfortable and life less the part where he is screening suspect employees at <UNK> is laughable if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my <UNK> fetish it's obviously over intellectual clumsy the city is as it is a convenient backdrop they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could shanghai as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner where the characters of the city often <UNK> the story slow as a wet week no chemistry real dramatic high points so so plot
<START> when i saw alien vs predator a few years ago i have to say as stupid as a sequel it was it was still somewhat enjoyable now there are unfortunately a <UNK> of good movies out in the theater lately so my boyfriend and i decided to just go ahead and see what aliens vs predator <UNK> was about so we saw it a couple nights ago and i have to say that there was absolutely nothing thrilling about this horror sequel it took a completely different turn from the first movie it's not a bad idea that they took alien and predator and put them in the up class <UNK> but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing this was just an average and predictable horror sequel not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where i wasn't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why so i couldn't really keep up with the story br br from what i've gathered of course the predator and the alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors they're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not go ahead and take it out on some <UNK> so they crash and alien is taking over the <UNK> <UNK> but teenagers including a troubled couple who look like ken and <UNK> a female marine and her daughter among others are going to make sure to kick some space butt that is if the predator doesn't get there first because he is <UNK> off at the alien i guess for starting the party without him lol just kidding actually for killing some of his friends br br aliens vs predator <UNK> isn't the worst movie by any standards it's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between alien and predator are so cool to watch like the first sequel of alien vs predator the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed i know it's horror but the original alien and predator films had characters that you cared about and wanted to win but it was a semi decent sequel that i would say is worth a look for some fun especially for ken and sake br br 4 10
<START> the is one of the best cartoons ever and it needs to be put on tv and dvd so people can have younger generations enjoy such a good show that is far better than the garbage they have made in the last 14 years i have a <UNK> online that is at the website address http www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> that originally was trying to get this show on five days a week but is now trying to get this show onto dvd since the tv station it was focused on has bad public relations we all need to convince the people who own this show to put it on dvd so it can be seen by future generations also since now toys owns the toy line of this show we might want to try to convince them to make a live action movie of it just like they have done with transformers and sometime this year g i joe we need good cartoons like this one to come back and be enjoyed by the younger generations please do sign this <UNK> so we can one day have dvds of the guys who are famous for yelling power extreme
<START> hulk hogan and <UNK> are horrible <UNK> and horrible actors hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal i'll never know why if not for vince <UNK> money this stupid film would have never been made maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling no holds <UNK> is not that movie
<START> since frame number 1 you know the good guy in the suit and <UNK> is he has no luck <UNK> <UNK> or so he believes with that music on the car radio and the dubious talk by his best friend and company associate who is taking him to parts unknown through a desert road <UNK> wished simply to be left alone to take a flight abroad next day <UNK> well someone we're left guessing br br the film goes a long way  that'll find short  to a closing scene with the man hearing the same music on a cab to the airport in between a number of lucky people have found different ways out of the story some dying some being born others falling into harrowing distress this time he's really or is he the film is a sort of one man show by director <UNK> <UNK> who only left the sound recording and the special effects to other competent people those who typically reject portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recording must go searching for other topics to criticize this time the car crash this isn't spoilers the film is too clever for that makes for a great scene and apparently was done with cheap equipment us studios take notice you may spare a dollar or two by hiding competent portuguese directors br br the rest was done by <UNK> from the script to the dialogue from camera work to editing if part of the dialogue were ad <UNK> then he again must be <UNK> for the acting direction and the casting with mostly inexperienced actors a large number of non speaking parts are credited but most of those people were used for the music video clip and the making of used <UNK> in the film's <UNK> trailer the cast has a dozen actors and actresses of whom ten relevant persons and a huge number of relationships  that are revealed step by step in a thrilling suspenseful way reminiscent of the best genre authors <UNK> and <UNK> do come to mind by the cat and mouse play between the director and his public and the nature of his characters br br i recommend this thriller and comedy to portuguese language <UNK> and if the film gets to have a decent translation of its <UNK> dialogue to anyone abroad who enjoys those genres
<START> the journey is a romantic version of the cold war it's about an english woman deborah kerr trying to <UNK> her former love a hungarian scientist jason <UNK> jr out of <UNK> during the <UNK> revolt in 1956 she's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of <UNK> through the <UNK> border br br of course the bus gets stopped by the russians for a security check the russian officer in charge <UNK> <UNK> becomes attracted to the english woman deborah kerr and <UNK> the trip of course the russian officer knows the truth about the hungarian scientist posing as a british citizen but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the english woman to come to him of course this all sounds absurd but it is a fun movie to watch despite the romantic flow of dialogue between mr <UNK> and ms kerr which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting the good acting <UNK> some of the silly dialogue perhaps some people involved in the hungarian revolt would not appreciate this movie they would consider it a piece of fluff br br this is my favorite <UNK> <UNK> role he speaks with his own <UNK> voice and is very attractive especially when he becomes vulnerable this is deborah second time working with <UNK> <UNK> since they made the king and i in 1956 they make a very attractive couple too bad they never worked again this was the second sexy role ms kerr took since from here to eternity despite the fact that ms kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie she was very beautiful and sensual br br the fine supporting cast was headed by jason <UNK> jr in his first film role some of the international cast were recognizable like for instance robert <UNK> from england however the rest of the actors i have never seen before or since were just great in the movie in the background it was fun to see <UNK> as one of the <UNK> speak a few lines of hungarian a few years later in 1966 she was in a movie cast a giant shadow with <UNK> <UNK> as his leading lady she is still working today
<START> i love dr who so much i believe that david <UNK> is the best dr the show has ever had and <UNK> <UNK> the best companion i liked the way the dr and rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the dr came close a few times to expressing his love for rose it sadly came to an end after only 2 seasons i will miss watching rose <UNK> and think that the show will not be the same without rose but david is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to watch him play this fantastic role i rate this show <UNK> it is fantastic the graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and i have actually learned somethings about love the world and relationships from this show therefore it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time
<START> this which was shown dubbed in italian at a rome cinema not as bad as it sounds after being presented at the rome film festival is very much an art film and a festival film guaranteed to charm and delight such audiences for its distinctive style <UNK> humor ability to draw comedy from the suffering of others appealing <UNK> music spot on performances <UNK> <UNK> and humanity but doomed because of its <UNK> and lack of a compelling story line to leave average audiences wondering what they're watching it for and why anyone <UNK> it how it even got made br br gives us almost a series of dry skits running through them are various themes money a guy at the next table <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of a rich bore talking on a cell phone in a restaurant over a glass of <UNK> then goes and orders a set of posh suits made to order a <UNK> son calls his celebrated father away from an elaborate gathering to beg him for one more <UNK> a shrink <UNK> <UNK> about his <UNK> <UNK> while his wife him in bed wearing only a shiny <UNK> helmet br br depression an <UNK> teacher jessica <UNK> breaks down in class because her husband has called her a <UNK> the <UNK> salesman <UNK> <UNK> before <UNK> because he's called her that several men have depressing dreams but hey this is sweden isn't everybody depressed love problems a fat <UNK> couple is <UNK> breaking up a girl <UNK> has fantasies about a lead <UNK> eric wives slam doors when their husbands start to practice their <UNK> music too is obviously a <UNK> theme besides the dashing <UNK> there's a <UNK> and a drum player <UNK> in a band and also play in <UNK> and <UNK> every scene has an added <UNK> from the music which <UNK> one sequence with another a raging storm outside the window of many scenes violent rain people out in it thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land this also the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same <UNK> day br br is a master of visual composition and the static middle distance shot and the film has a <UNK> gray green look <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> that's perfect because it evokes the <UNK> of a swedish winter but also with the subtle colors of the director's wit which ends every scene with a smile one almost never knew <UNK> could be so beautiful or perhaps one did <UNK> creates such effects sometimes in very different <UNK> within scenes and in the film as a whole there's a kind of <UNK> that comes out of the visual style the pacing of scenes and the detached <UNK> of the overall <UNK> there's something about a fully <UNK> style that's <UNK> <UNK> br br not everything works equally well one may feel <UNK> with the succession of barely related scenes which read too much sometimes like the work of a saturday night live writer in need of <UNK> since some scenes <UNK> move you or draw a laugh it's obvious that others fall a little flat br br but some scenes are real <UNK> and one obviously <UNK> climax of pure magic is a dream described and then <UNK> dreams being another important thread in which the girl <UNK> <UNK> herself in a wedding dress newly married to her <UNK> <UNK> ideal who plays a delicate series of <UNK> while a crowd of <UNK> <UNK> outside a big window the viewpoint switches to outside and the window <UNK> slowly away as if the building the dream <UNK> look out of were a train moving out of a station to take them to their honeymoon it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect br br eventually one may feel everything in you the living du is a dream including the recurring scene where the <UNK> is always striking a <UNK> bell and <UNK> last order time <UNK> all the <UNK> customers rise from their tables and go up to get one more drink br br an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right it limits itself in a dozen ways but there is greatness in it roy is a little master like some medieval of the inner comedies of <UNK> <UNK> and this is a film unlike any other shown this year as a cannes un certain regard selection this is also the swedish entry for the 2007 best foreign oscar hard to say what bergman would think but worked with him is famous for his <UNK> produced tv commercials some of which one can see on youtube bergman called them the best commercials in the world it will be interesting to see if this director whose craft is as subtle as his viewpoint will start working in longer segments some time meanwhile any good film buff really needs to get a look at this br br isn't quite the right word that means delight in the misery of others is teaching us to delight in the misery of all of us
<START> an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house <UNK> anna <UNK> the teenager daughter of mark <UNK> who is sick and has some mental problems and the nurse maria lena <UNK> notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul <UNK> but her mother does not believe on her <UNK> decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos <UNK> <UNK> the origins of the house and they find that forty years ago the place was the stage of the death of six children <UNK> decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert <UNK> <UNK> to protect her brother against the house and her father br br i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna <UNK> lena <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> and <UNK> los <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> further i like very much spanish cinema in spite of i found a terrible screenplay an awful direction and a <UNK> acting of excellent actors and actresses the intention of the story is good slightly <UNK> the <UNK> in some moments but unfortunately it is badly developed never being clear for example the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family mainly the situation between maria and <UNK> the direction is confused poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story i love anna <UNK> but her <UNK> face never works in this flick lena <UNK> is a caricature of the great actress she is and <UNK> is too much weak for such important role only <UNK> <UNK> has a good performance in his support character i liked the open end of the story my vote is four br br title brazil a the seventh victim
<START> dee <UNK> is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and overacting kind of ruined it for me the whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously it tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of seven without the good acting the movie highlights the urban industrial rock <UNK> body art <UNK> and expects us to be impressed scared by the size of a guy's nose ring i'm not a expert on movies but the script and acting in this movie are just awful dee <UNK> looks the part of the villain but his <UNK> is downright horrid i recommend not wasting the time on this one unless nothing else is available
<START> what was the aim here i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim poor acting no action and no story i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david <UNK> 250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go br br war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama this film <UNK> in comparison to any that i've seen before i must say that <UNK> truly disappointed at this film
<START> once again doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load it has humour you're just making it up as you go along <UNK> but i do it brilliantly action monsters in this case still more kick ass tragedy and scare tactics in short just what the doctor ordered pun intended the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of get on with it so <UNK> up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh then made you cry and made you go <UNK> br br in terms of character development this is clearly the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> mickey and ricky being one of the doctor's companions you know that he will do the right thing and may even suspect the manner that he does it however it is still an emotional <UNK> when he <UNK> his future path br br while the rise of the had more of the sinister build up to terror the age of steel is an all out blast like alien compared to aliens both true classics but in different ways can the series keep it up at this level let's hope so
<START> how better to describe it than <UNK> criminals on tv and i don't mean in the show cops here they're actually being presented as protagonists br br i don't see any <UNK> value in this show unless you have a perverse <UNK> for human <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a tragic example of the fallen star a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky bobby brown is nothing but a low life criminal why watch him why does <UNK> stand by him no matter how despicable he is this couple should be locked up and it's a <UNK> shame they are making money and achieving a <UNK> of fame from watching the <UNK> tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character
<START> words can <UNK> describe this movie loaded with ridiculous stereotypes a silly plot and poor music this movie lacks in just about every category br br don't be fooled by the imdb credits this is not a michael <UNK> movie he's a secondary character in the grand scheme br br also listed in the <UNK> is an actor named prince which makes me wonder if it's the same artist <UNK> known as then again i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that br br big summary bunch of teams one has <UNK> one has 35 000 one has an illegal substance and one has <UNK> 000 add some confusion and as to who needs to meet who revenge on being taken and such and you end up with this mess of a movie br br given a choice i'd pass on this movie
<START> this movie is quite better than the first one et <UNK> <UNK> but it is far away from perfection the adaptation of the comic book is good some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book but there's few things that made the movie not as <UNK> as the animated movie released in 1968 for example the fighting between and this wasn't necessary or even credible either for the little love story of there were also some stuff missing like the songs that are in the animated movie and some other things i am <UNK> by the movie because they in the stuff i was expecting tho see and they showed things that i did not wanted or needed to see i know that it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same than the comic book or the animated movie but that's what i expected in conclusion even if the movie is good i still prefer the animated movie <UNK> is in my opinion far better
<START> eh i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the <UNK> <UNK> and because the commercials for it looked serious i was expecting something that was halfway decent br br ten minutes into the film i realized that it was utter crap the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare and i mean bare minimum parents half brother and <UNK> seemed to be named correctly other than that the rest of the film seemed to be one giant <UNK> br br i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film the disney version was made for little kids therefore wasn't too serious this movie with all the sex violence and nudity was clearly intended for an older audience yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film
<START> lord have mercy why was this film made why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it the <UNK> is so excruciatingly bad in every <UNK> way that it <UNK> the mind br br the film has an ultra cheap look to it like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate the result is a film that just don't look right the fight scenes are so dull and edited to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore none of them are engaging or exciting the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any <UNK> to it the eastern europe locations a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down or non existent look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an <UNK> film what action br br and what is the deal with the title as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign which one does the title refer to br br the dvd is in 1 85 1 <UNK> widescreen and in <UNK> 5 1 sound neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent the <UNK> is not worth one second of your time gotta love that <UNK> tho <UNK> they think they can stop him they're dead wrong ' <UNK>
<START> yes you can look at <UNK> feast as some sort of slap at <UNK> christianity but it is much more than that the surface story of how a gifted <UNK> cook <UNK> paris after one of its <UNK> by the middle classes and finds herself cast <UNK> in <UNK> in the north of <UNK> is simply the grease that allows the deeper tale to develop br br <UNK> is an artist one of the small army of people who are driven from <UNK> to post over the centuries by <UNK> politicians <UNK> greedy and arrogant who kill beauty for profit something that politics always does pace national <UNK> for the arts which simply creativity for propaganda purposes br br <UNK> is on her last legs as she arrives in the tiny village where two <UNK> sisters <UNK> seeing over their <UNK> flock of <UNK> to their late <UNK> father they live on salt <UNK> and black bread <UNK> br br <UNK> shows these simple <UNK> people that god is in pleasure and <UNK> as well as <UNK> and mental <UNK> she also shows them how that mental <UNK> can lead to control something we all know about in these days of the neo in government who would limit our personal <UNK> because they are somehow a crime against the state or as they would tell us humanity br br <UNK> <UNK> up a bang up french dinner to celebrate the <UNK> birthday of the late <UNK> the daughters and their flock think it is the devil come amongst them and <UNK> not to notice the food or drink br br it is at this point in the preparing of the meal <UNK> for by <UNK> <UNK> in a french <UNK> that i begin to tear up it is a <UNK> brought about in comparison to the daily <UNK> and that <UNK> our consciousness from morning to night via the media and power <UNK> to gain advantage over all of us out here in the dark br br the simple sophistication of <UNK> art <UNK> in the face of all the <UNK> on display in our modern society and it hurts to watch it played out so <UNK> in this splendid film br br it is along with <UNK> alexander bergman my favorite film ever yet i can only watch it once in awhile because like a rare bottle of wine served with and fresh <UNK> it is something that must not be over done br br a great great film that should be in every movie <UNK> library

<START> don't torture a <UNK> lucio fulci italy 1972 br br definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in giallo land originally the film was titled even more <UNK> don't torture donald duck literally translated from its italian title a small donald duck figure features briefly as a toy but hardly enough to render a title like this but apparently it was changed in fear of legal <UNK> by disney i quite a bit against <UNK> earlier lizard in a woman's skin 1971 but here all the right ingredients are present a surprisingly effective mystery a good cast and <UNK> shot against an unusual rural setting everything just <UNK> i think it's <UNK> <UNK> as one of the director's most accomplished achievements br br the story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain side town in <UNK> where someone is killing young teenage boys among the suspects the most obvious one is a young woman <UNK> <UNK> a self <UNK> witch who is seen <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of a baby and sticking <UNK> into way <UNK> <UNK> the village idiot is under suspicion as well since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap by the time a quick witted <UNK> arrives from <UNK> to cover the murders he immediately begins to question the <UNK> <UNK> when he meets two other potential suspects don <UNK> the local priest marc <UNK> with a high minded attitude and <UNK> barbara <UNK> a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense who also <UNK> having sexual relations with the young boys in town talk about your prime red <UNK> br br fulci nicely <UNK> <UNK> and tradition with the newly constructed <UNK> highway meandering through the <UNK> hills past old towns where life is still firmly <UNK> in tradition and <UNK> one could debate about the film's political stance as the north versus the south or as commentary on small town virtues <UNK> conventions in general that are all too often dangerously close to <UNK> over into moral <UNK> chaos and ultimately self justice by the <UNK> the film has often been <UNK> because of its anti catholic tone but it's hardly an important element here except for obvious plot related reasons which would be giving away too much it's actually rather tame compared to a film like don't deliver us from evil 1971 probably the film's rather <UNK> portrayal of small town <UNK> values when another boy is killed the local <UNK> are depicted as a retarded lynch mob might be cause for some offense in <UNK> but considering <UNK> relation with the rest of italy hardly <UNK> for other italians i would think the film <UNK> into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway br br when talking fulci the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion although eyes <UNK> scenes are lacking the film does contain two very graphic scenes in the gross out finale the killer falls of a cliff <UNK> his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results albeit not very realistic and the chain <UNK> sequence with <UNK> <UNK> in the graveyard shows <UNK> <UNK> for sadistic violence and typically he's not holding back at <UNK> showing what most film makers would merely hint at surely one of the most horrifying scenes in <UNK> <UNK> br br above all this is a taut well written effective little mystery nicely <UNK> by fulci with an impressive cast of genre <UNK> like barbara <UNK> marc <UNK> not very convincing as a priest <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> mouth crazy as the town's witch br br camera <UNK> 8 10
<START> 1 must be as the reviewer in the new york times who preferred the <UNK> <UNK> big brother and the holding company album to the just released <UNK> white album was called either evil or insane national <UNK> is a great film elizabeth <UNK> performance is fantastic and i fail to <UNK> even a trace of accent much less too much of one her performance is very natural authentic and unbelievably charming the rest of the cast is superb especially rooney and <UNK> br br as far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental i suggest <UNK> has too long on a <UNK> of irony and has lost the ability to <UNK> genuine straight forward emotion and human interaction there was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of the magical <UNK> through it that is the reason to tell the story one might as well criticize the wizard of oz king kong the <UNK> <UNK> casablanca the black <UNK> the other great horse film or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem <UNK> than real life no my friend national <UNK> <UNK> because of its belief firmly in itself with tongue firmly not in cheek something today's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate
<START> a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those <UNK> to rent some cheesy non seen flicks my friend grabbed head of the family and we were <UNK> by a head sitting in a wheelchair well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie well you guessed it it was me i have never been so in all my life we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about <UNK> because this was the funniest film in the world i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments this movie it makes me laugh even more head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
<START> i will leave it to my <UNK> <UNK> here to <UNK> and <UNK> at this wonderful movie and just say that i thought it <UNK> the great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views and seek them out by all means no telling what you will come out of the film with for me the ones who saw through the and <UNK> of it have my money there was one dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing which belong to pacino the meeting and the airport other than that well what a waste of time utterly pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five <UNK> at about the level of his <UNK> everybody always says but this movie could have been so much better sure they all could have been but really most of them just should never have been made including this one
<START> based on what little i have seen of this show i don't think i will ever watch it again its not even remotely believable and frankly the derek character just makes me angry br br sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again why would i want to watch that no thanks there are plenty of other shows that involve <UNK> characters phil of the <UNK> for example where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though br br not to mention that i think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step siblings yes life isn't <UNK> but one could attempt to portray a character that wasn't outright evil and wins br br my suggestion is that you watch this only if you like seeing the villain win
<START> a flesh eating <UNK> where does that guy <UNK> what the <UNK> keep getting inspiration anyway even for the low low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people genre and me this one is just beyond awful the <UNK> is one of the <UNK> <UNK> weakest monsters i've ever seen i think he just ended up in the east river because sea world got sick of him the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the <UNK> <UNK> them bunch of idiots that way he'll never learn you guys want all the other giant killer <UNK> that's the correct <UNK> by the way to laugh at him <UNK> br br up to stop the <UNK> are wind <UNK> that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick and his partner who will <UNK> in a week but first has to be eaten by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> won the fight a couple more and he's going to <UNK> the <UNK> in my mind stay nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing doesn't he have a gun or something but no that magically doesn't help either br br okay enter sea <UNK> love interest rachel is this based on some comic book or something anyway together they try to stop the <UNK> by walking in the park they hope this helps <UNK> it's the 4th of july in a couple of days and the <UNK> might join the party and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick <UNK> the <UNK> some more sea cops br br but <UNK> crappy that ends crappy nick manages to blow the <UNK> to bits a couple of times and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh you know on <UNK> vision this would probably get an r in real life i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is suitable for absolutely nobody there's no sex no gore no nothing now forget this movie ever existed join the club
<START> i found the movie to be very light and enjoyable one knows that the story is not real life like yet the depiction is superb br br lyrics are really good and john travolta in his usual style i like the scene <UNK> he as an angel gives up his own stuff to bring life back to the dog
<START> i'm torn about this show while most parts of it i found to be hilarious other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children however i don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things it's not that i think oh poor children they're being exploited it's just that it's really not clever it's something that anyone could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural <UNK> from children which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time br br by far the funniest part of wonder is clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers it's really funny and it's mostly improvised seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion br br you should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny even if it is stupid at times
<START> i haven't seen a lot of episodes of family guy and it's a pretty safe bet that i won't be seeing too many in the future some people say to compare this show to the simpsons is unfair i absolutely think this show wouldn't exist if the simpsons hadn't come first and i absolutely think it wants so very much to be the simpsons i don't understand what's so funny about this show in the episodes that i've watched i've understood where they've wanted me to laugh i understand that someone thinks a joke was just told but the joke isn't funny i find the whole show to be lazy the title the jokes there is a complete lack of inspiration throughout br br the best shows on television cartoon or not are created like this a script is written it goes through several <UNK> stuff that doesn't work is taken out inspiration is <UNK> good stuff is added there are more <UNK> and then it is filmed br br i picture a family guy episode to be created like this a script is written and it's filmed
<START> a film by <UNK> sends a <UNK> down my spine every time the <UNK> print which opens the spanish <UNK> latest feature instantly <UNK> memories of <UNK> nuns gentle <UNK> i haven't even got as far as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> early work and after a beautiful opening montage with the camera <UNK> across a wind swept graveyard animated by a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i thought <UNK> had me again under his wicked spell br br yet once my nostalgia had <UNK> there was very little to fill its place for a director who <UNK> in bringing humanity to <UNK> and <UNK> he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women penelope <UNK> is a <UNK> housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband thankfully she lives in <UNK> spain where your friends will quite happily help to <UNK> of a corpse for the offer of a round of <UNK> add to the melting pot the ghost of mother and a host of other <UNK> warm hearted <UNK> means literally to return and <UNK> does appear to be <UNK> old material the sub plot of incest feels as though it were tacked on as the obligatory taboo instead of commenting on or <UNK> the issue as with his treatment of <UNK> in bad education it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chick flick sentimentality i suggest <UNK> call his next film to move on
<START> anna christie greta garbo returns to see her father chris george f marion after 15 years he is the <UNK> of a boat and she stays to travel with him during this time she meets matt charles <UNK> and they fall in love matt and chris don't see eye to eye and anna has a secret to confess br br what a boring story it starts badly with george f marion and marie <UNK> playing <UNK> in a bar the scene goes on forever and they are both terrible its also hard to understand them in fact its difficult to understand the whole cast i missed whole sections of dialogue between <UNK> marion and garbo because it is incomprehensible garbo is obviously something special as you are drawn to her every time that she is on screen and her presence gives this film the 4 stars that i have given to it but nothing really happens its a boring story with atrocious accents you'll do well to stay awake
<START> i saw this film shortly after watching <UNK> <UNK> with elizabeth <UNK> gwyneth whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner there are a lot of similarities between the two films they both have great casts and good acting they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different an offensive stepmother a woman friend <UNK> an emotionally <UNK> father a dead mother and a surprise lover both films have the characters experience life changing <UNK> and both films suffer from a kind of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sentimentality they both add a little <UNK> with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked br br both films seem contrived as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said ok there's a market for stories about relationships between women so i'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive in other words instead of the drama <UNK> from the truth of the relationship the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation it seems forced the characters don't seem real the relationships are unbelievable br br the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely <UNK> away years of <UNK> leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after it's just not real romantic fantasy br br the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than <UNK> <UNK> especially the stepmother part is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her or even marry her in the first place br br if you liked <UNK> <UNK> you will probably like in her shoes as well enjoyable performances in both in fact the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts
<START> i'm going to make this short and sweet it's not surprising that you had no use for this film this is a story about the power beauty and possibilities inherent in a meaningful education based on your <UNK> composed comments i can see that your own education has been woefully neglected or worse completely wasted your comments are those of a truly ignorant person i would advise you to do something about this condition but in your case i feel it's probably too late my hope is that you yourself don't intend to go into the teaching profession especially in film studies because you could only do damage oh one last bit of advice in the future if you intend to write more opinion pieces you should really <UNK> your work it will make people take you more seriously
<START> horrendous i'm a teenager and i don't mind teen movies but this is horrible aaron carter plays this <UNK> named <UNK> mcqueen and to keep his <UNK> up or something he works together with the <UNK> jane but the girls' are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isn't realistic how would any of those girls get away with wearing no <UNK> tube tops and shirts that expose the belly in high school at my school we'd be sent home for something like that br br and one part of the movie where <UNK> <UNK> jane she says tight he must think i'm an idiot i didn't know was so <UNK> ' how is <UNK> and how obsessed jane is with <UNK> and how he <UNK> in love with her is very stupid the dialogue is cheesy and stupid the <UNK> terrible the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to none br br for <UNK> who still love aaron carter you'll enjoy it if you're a casual watcher like me this is not the movie for you
<START> my mom brought me this movie on a dvd a guy in a rental recommended it but in fact this might be the worst movie i've ever seen you know i didn't expect much from this film but it didn't have a good story it wasn't even funny and it was senseless i was looking forward to see christine <UNK> in this movie because i loved step by step even she was a huge disappointment the story was completely unreal one of the party guys is dead he wasn't dead in fact he woke up later the house looks like there <UNK> a bomb and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything but then there comes a homosexual policeman there is a total mess till the end and the guys managed to tide up and everything in like 15 minutes come on just be realistic at least waste of money really
<START> his significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this <UNK> but fred <UNK> has done far better urban action films including many of his later <UNK> released fare the big <UNK> <UNK> films of the early to mid 70's rarely had the punch of their mid level counterparts and this is a prime example clumsy action little violence and the pg rating is nowhere near questionable worth a look for hammer <UNK> in any case
<START> <UNK> is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality and yet i more than imagine hector owes some of his film making chops with this film to <UNK> de <UNK> neo <UNK> style in particular that film as with <UNK> takes place mostly inside a children's prison and yet while i might still prefer de <UNK> film if it came down to deciding between the two it's so close because it is no pun intended like choosing between two children they're both marvelous works of raw drama and with <UNK> has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isn't filmed in conditions brought on after a world war this is how it was in brazil one would see it with slightly more flair and awe in city of god perhaps in some of the same locations and these children were on the streets before and after the film was made some aren't alive some 20 years later for all anyone knows br br the star pre teen street kid <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> plays the title character a youth without a father or really any family who will look out for him and placed among dozens of other street kids and <UNK> in a <UNK> for boys the conditions couldn't be much worse and are made even more unbearable as two children are killed one after the other by some cause of the guard duty there's a riot and an escape and halfway through the film we find <UNK> with a few other <UNK> including a practical <UNK> not even 18 and they become <UNK> drug dealers whatever to get by none of this i should repeat is shown with a kind of ham <UNK> <UNK> certainly you would never in a million years see ron howard or paul <UNK> direct this kind of picture and yet there's an emotional honesty to everything exactly because nothing is <UNK> br br nearly every scene is significant to showing how fragile life is for <UNK> and how he could be killed or die some way at any turn and so without even reaching <UNK> yet he has to be on the level of those around him who are a little older though not by much at all and become things that will haunt this person forever despite usage of a tender and <UNK> musical score and one or two scenes with people crying a lot nothing feels forced as with de <UNK> maybe more so given the consistent conditions of san <UNK> and <UNK> street kids he's a natural director of children and out of <UNK> da <UNK> and <UNK> and others some really fine work that provides just the right touches of cinematic drama that is not so real that it becomes documentary which isn't a bad thing per say and even subtlety in some scenes br br <UNK> may not be as well known as it's later 21st century brazilian films that look back on the horrors of <UNK> or even neo <UNK> films but it should be anyone wanting to get a good hard glimpse at what it was like should seek it out at a library or other and <UNK> in what is the best foreign film of 1981
<START> you know i only watched 15 minutes of this film so i can't really describe how great it is i mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director you just can't miss i mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet this film comes on you watch it and are shocked it is so brilliant so original it is so great it will feel to you that half an hour later you've turned off the screen but as you go to your bed you see it's only 15 minutes after midnight enjoy br br 3 out of 10
<START> once upon a time there was a great american film which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills this film featured clever direction groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting it was entitled <UNK> american werewolf in london ' sixteen years later the long <UNK> sequel was finally <UNK> onto the poster board outside your local theater surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original think again <UNK> american werewolf in <UNK> is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish the problems begin with the leading man tom everett scott's performance is stiff and tiresome from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are <UNK> in his defense not even a seasoned shakespearean <UNK> could have <UNK> a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue at one point one of scott's deceased friends who's soul is doomed to walk the earth after being <UNK> up by one of the werewolves is finally able to leave for the <UNK> he then <UNK> to scott and his friends guys see ya ' what a memorable goodbye julie <UNK> soon shows up as scott's mysterious european love interest basically she's a french girl playing the french girl it isn't much of a stretch but all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film the special effects such an integral part of the superb original film fall far short in this flop the werewolves look like cartoons and no matter how well you <UNK> a cartoon with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's still hard to get scared of a cartoon so instead the <UNK> american gang led by the ultra weak scott keep finding excuses to return to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison i disagree this film can not stand on its own and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original if it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film i don't care how much you love werewolves or how much you <UNK> <UNK> werewolf in london ' as i myself did this one is simply not worth wasting your time guys see ya ' terrible 3 out of a possible 10 t h
<START> whatever <UNK> of pc <UNK> is responsible for this movie has achieved something that i never thought possible to take some truly gifted actors davis <UNK> and taylor and make you want to <UNK> you never encounter them in an <UNK> space ever the sentiments that <UNK> the screenplay are so and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what audience would find this picture appealing much less funny architecture students perhaps br br only one scene is visually clever <UNK> gay <UNK> all and rhythm into a bar manages to <UNK> more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film added up and <UNK> to the <UNK> power as for the other members of the cast they probably won't want to put this one on their <UNK>
<START> the animal eating geek scenes were not as bad as you would think after having watched <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> magic these scenes are average the <UNK> one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me br br otherwise the film was just sort of interesting i always like hearing the silly voice overs they never sound like what you think the actor actress would sound like in real life i liked the bright colors worn by the <UNK> the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too the youngest princess looked really young almost 14 or something the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes so that was good br br 3 10
<START> thank god i was not operating any heavy <UNK> it could have been an even worst disaster shots were slow very repetitive different scenes same shots medium shot medium shot medium shot <UNK> story line was rather empty william hurt was the worst where did he get that stupid accent from random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much there were more shots of traveling in her car than anything else the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option great <UNK> if you can't sleep there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back
<START> a large bed possessed by a demon eats people among other things i'm not making this up br br completed in 1977 and not officially released until it came to dvd in 2003 death bed the bed that eats is a movie whose plot is impossible to describe you most likely know of it thanks to <UNK> excellent bit about it as well as stephen <UNK> essential book nightmare usa while watching it you wonder the following br br who is george <UNK> and what drugs did he smoke <UNK> <UNK> before writing and directing this movie br br is this a horror comedy a combination of a horror flick and an art movie a weird prank being pulled on the audience br br what the hell am i watching br br death bed really defies any explanation i know that term is <UNK> but it couldn't be <UNK> than it is here this truly <UNK> description it is a horror comedy as well as art film horror hybrid but the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen the score sounds like the electronic bits from an old album the acting is terrible and <UNK> from everything the direction is surprisingly competent and the movie at times feels like a jesus franco movie that is if his movies were intentionally funny br br in the end there really is no proper way to describe this movie lord knows i've tried but really few movies are as odd unique or mind <UNK> as this is see it but you've been warned this is also the only movie george <UNK> has ever done he definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this i'll tell you that much
<START> the remarkable sometimes <UNK> often brilliant films of john cassavetes <UNK> a unique position in american low budget partly improvised inspired by <UNK> <UNK> documentary and related to underground film they have nevertheless frequently managed to reach a wide and profoundly <UNK> <UNK> br br after drama studies the young cassavetes quickly made his name as an unusually <UNK> intense actor often appearing in films about <UNK> rebellious youth such as crime in the streets and edge of the city br br setting up an actors' <UNK> he worked to <UNK> an <UNK> experiment into his feature the result shadows taking three years to complete and partly <UNK> by his performances in tv's johnny <UNK> was a breakthrough in american about the effect of racism on an already <UNK> relationship between two black men and their sister two of whom pass for white the film is impressive for its <UNK> seemingly <UNK> style and <UNK> plot was minimal mood and emotional apparent truth were <UNK>
<START> western union is something of a forgotten classic western perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact of its on dvd in the united states however all is not lost as it has now appeared on region 2 in england this being a <UNK> in some ways is not only <UNK> but totally ironic when one considers that a movie depicting the <UNK> and establishment of such a uniquely american organization as the western union <UNK> company is without a region 1 release it <UNK> belief it simply doesn't make sense br br produced by fox in 1941 western union was directed by fritz lang this was only the second occasion the great german director <UNK> to direct a western he had done an excellent job the year before with <UNK> the return of frank james and would have only one more western outing in <UNK> with the splendid notorious lang was no ford or <UNK> but with western union he turned in a fine solid western that holds up very well beautifully photographed in early three strip technicolor by edward it <UNK> a good cast headed by robert young randolph scott and dean jagger the female lead is taken by virginia <UNK> who really has little to do in the picture an actress who never made anything of her career her presence here is merely <UNK> br br it is curious that robert young has top billing over scott it is clearly scott's picture from the very beginning when we first see him in the film's terrific opening scene being chased by a <UNK> across the <UNK> young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and seems out of place in a western he just looks plain silly going up against barton in a <UNK> an actor who never really distinguished himself except perhaps with <UNK> <UNK> young appeared in a string of forgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties culminating with his greatest success when for seven years he was tv's marcus <UNK> in the seventies he died in 1998 at the age of <UNK> br br western union <UNK> the connection by <UNK> wire of <UNK> and salt lake city scott plays a <UNK> outlaw hired by western union boss dean jagger to protect the line from <UNK> <UNK> and to also take on and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own <UNK> ends robert young is the young engineer from back east who joins the company and <UNK> with scott for the affections of miss <UNK> some comic relief is provided by and <UNK> so some would say by slim <UNK> and john carradine turns up in a <UNK> role as the company doctor br br altogether though a <UNK> good western albeit on region 2 but in <UNK> good quality that fans will be delighted with my only <UNK> is that there are no extras not even a trailer and that terrible cover with those dull graphics ugh br br <UNK> interestingly the associate producer on western union was harry joe brown who later with randolph scott would create a <UNK> that would produce some of scott's finest westerns in the fifties
<START> the vicious circle is a very unknown british mystery story like many hitchcock movies it's about a man who is being accused of a crime he didn't commit and does everything he can to prove it this time it's a dr john mills who finds a murdered german actress from his floor as an honest man the doctor calls scotland yard which turns out to be a big mistake br br there's really nothing special in this little movie still watching the film is an entertaining way to pass time i enjoyed following the plot development fine actors are a plus
<START> crimes of passion is a film that is disappointing on most counts where should i start from the plot it is <UNK> simplistic and full of gaps the direction reminds a cheap b movie the acting john <UNK> is utterly terrible in his role as well <UNK> husband of a frozen wife bobby annie <UNK> is unconvincing as frozen wife amy and it is only kathleen turner above average and <UNK> <UNK> excellent which get passable acting marks more specifically <UNK> <UNK> gives a great performance as the <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and <UNK> joanna <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately the performances of turner and <UNK> alone are <UNK> to help get the film a grade higher than 4 10 watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition basic instinct for example otherwise avoid
<START> i remember when this nbc mini series aired when i was in high school after reading the novel i thought i'd check out some adaptations didn't expect much out of a tv mini series but now i might have to check out some more this is actually excellent and the best possible film version that could be made writer simon moore who wrote the <UNK> for the original traffic mini series upon which the <UNK> film was based came up with a brilliant narrative <UNK> which helps the story flow very smoothly he frames <UNK> adventures as flashbacks with the actual story beginning as <UNK> first returns home everything having happened on one journey <UNK> played by ted <UNK> is sort of crazy seeming when his wife mary <UNK> <UNK> him back into his home unfortunately the house is now owned by the local doctor james fox who has designs on <UNK> <UNK> seems merely disturbed at first but when he starts telling stories of tiny people that's all the evidence fox needs to throw him into an insane asylum all four of <UNK> travels are related in this version in the same order as the novel the only time this has been done on film i love the way his present situation reflects his flashbacks <UNK> small son whom he has never met before reminds him of the the doctors who observe him in his cell from a <UNK> above him and remind him of the and the scientific <UNK> remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of the and the <UNK> at the academy finally when he is put on trial he is reminded of the and the <UNK> the cast of this thing is amazing and includes peter o'toole ned beatty <UNK> <UNK> john gielgud <UNK> scott thomas omar <UNK> and <UNK> davis the biggest flaw of the mini series is that the acting is really uneven you have all these fine actors but the lesser characters are often played by actors who were probably fine in episodes of l a law but don't do well in a costume drama ted <UNK> isn't especially great although he has a few sequences where he excels it's probably better that he didn't attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent <UNK> is actually pretty good at it and is quite good overall another flaw the series has is that the adventures happen a tad too quickly it's not believable that <UNK> spent eight years away from home as is claimed but in general it captures <UNK> tone and purpose very well while with its structure adding a new emotional level
<START> darling <UNK> is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake <UNK> is shown to be at his best he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen br br the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing <UNK> away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews br br for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock br br as it is inspirational purely inspirational one of andrews most memorable lines in this film
<START> i truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes but this one is completely different it's simply brilliant plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great br br i've seen it at least dozen times and still i'm not tired with the plot characters or music i just love the soundtrack it's the only soundtrack that i've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that i owe br br for me it's a must seen kind of movie great characters <UNK> with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end
<START> what a turd i like john <UNK> but man this is bad i thought <UNK> was the worst movie he had been in but i was wrong i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace <UNK> 2 to american werewolf in london this is a piece of trash
<START> milo is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guys <UNK> so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it a long time ago he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people friday the 13th what's that one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is <UNK> out till only the final girl is left to find out <UNK> dull i mean dark secret she and her friends have been dying to know once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage isn't it his <UNK> yet and the girl well she screams a lot the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity
<START> this was one of the biggest pieces of crap i have ever had to watch i mean seriously how would anybody else feel if they were in woody <UNK> shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks after all she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it how can you trust her who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married i don't care how desperate they were that's the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life then he <UNK> out on her apparently he had no right to <UNK> her other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome oh and wait then he's supposed to apologize to her after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with of course woody has no right to say anything to her or <UNK> her especially after she still has roy card in her <UNK> then at the end of the movie she's apparently so in love with woody still and misses him so much that she was not going to leave <UNK> until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave and she <UNK> thanks <UNK> are you <UNK> kidding me was she under contract as his sex slave or something i mean what the <UNK> oh and wait it gets better she <UNK> kisses him <UNK> before she gets out of the car <UNK> she's not a whore oh thank you for letting me go let me go make out with you one last time for good <UNK> sake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending what was this movie supposed to represent nothing came out of this this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in my life two pathetic desperate people if i were woody i would tell her to go <UNK> herself in that body of water they were near apparently he had no self respect what the hell was roy <UNK> thinking by taking this horrible role i feel like <UNK> after watching this this movie was so bad it was seriously laughable i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of
<START> the original body and soul <UNK> is a masterpiece john garfield ann <UNK> <UNK> william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest <UNK> to ever grace the screen james wong <UNK> this remake is <UNK> in spite of the presence of rod <UNK> joe <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> there is nothing of value here and it is a shame this product bears the same title as the brilliant original only the main character's name charlie davis is the same in both films i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake i am amazed that rod <UNK> <UNK> this may be the only bad film he ever made maybe he needed the paycheck
<START> i don't know if it's fair for me to review this i'm not a fan of gratuitous violence i've never understood the movie industry making heroes out of mob members and cold blooded killers when the godfather came out i thought they had broken the mold but the decades have produced a series of well acted mob movies with major stars and directors doing them this one is obviously low budget but it is certainly well done at some point in all of these i feel like i want to take a shower if such characters actually exist it is hard for the soul i always <UNK> that <UNK> will rise above this sort of thing this kind of <UNK> has to be stopped i hope the people that go to films like this are more <UNK> and less <UNK> i feel sort of the same way about slasher movies why do we have a fascination with death and <UNK> in fairness i am judging this on the acting and directing and for what it is it seems to work pretty well
<START> criticism does mention spoilers br br i rarely make user comments but this is one movie i have no problem <UNK> this movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp the bone collector is not at all the same <UNK> of film that silence of the <UNK> or seven were despite what its ad claims this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller the pace of this movie was extremely slow i actually left for about 10 minutes half way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression i refer to you the part where angelina <UNK> character <UNK> denzel about cutting off a hands the movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with a love subplot albeit sexy angelina <UNK> character and denzel <UNK> of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor student relationship as seen in the epic silence of the <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> however even this lacks all <UNK> and i was personally <UNK> for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed <UNK> between the two with such a crappy movie i was half expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like <UNK> road and scream pulled off anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved a situation which alfred hitchcock's rear window the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me <UNK> <UNK> over the screen <UNK> speaking i even think the <UNK> intention was completely lost as denzel happily <UNK> from his loss over the proverbial <UNK> and gets with his pet project angelina br br if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts like i am you will not appreciate this film if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch up on every single hollywood cliche ever <UNK> the late night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serial killer to prime investigator relationship the horrible trying to get by in an all male dominated <UNK> aka see this movie but even then its too slow paced and you'd be bored
<START> i saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember how much i loved it it really touched me and i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> <UNK> work in it highly recommended atmospheric and touching br br i think of this film from time to time and am disappointed it hasn't enjoyed as much of a revival as many classic films hadn't realized <UNK> i searched for it today that it won an academy award for best original story for ben <UNK> and charles macarthur br br basically it involves a nasty character who destroys <UNK> career and is cursed because of it he dies but is allowed redemption if he can convince someone to shed a tear over him the bulk of the movies shows him in pursuit of this goal well written and lovely i had known him for his plays so i was surprised to see him in this role on tv late one night in new york a must see if you ever have the opportunity
<START> this film held my interest from the beginning to the very end with plenty of laughs and real down to earth acting by the entire cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jackson is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who likes poetry and had a very sexy girl friend lawrence hilton <UNK> morris was an outstanding <UNK> at the <UNK> h s and even won a <UNK> to a famous college there are scenes in this picture with the chicago police department chasing all these <UNK> in a <UNK> and a visit to the lincoln park <UNK> with monkey dung being thrown around the music is outstanding and there is great photography around the city of chicago great film enjoy
<START> every time this movie used to re air on late night tv in the late 70s and early 80s i would always make time to sit in front of the tv and watch it to see the lovely kate jackson handsome richard long the great polly <UNK> whom i've never seen anywhere else except for this tv movie the endearing tom <UNK> and another great whom i've never seen outside this movie <UNK> this is truly the love boat on a cruise to murder and mayhem and boy was it ever good and every time i would watch it i would always forget who the real murderer was br br as expected someone here is already <UNK> the movie as if that really is a big help to anyone this is a great tv movie and worth watching each and every time i can't say that about half the movies i've seen this month br br if you ever get a chance to watch it on tv someday which isn't likely watch it in light of the girl most likely to finally coming out this year on dvd maybe there's hope for a dvd release of death cruise
<START> this is a good film no doubt but with some odd aspects without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only a <UNK> farm the boat and <UNK> island new york all shots are close up so we never see a broad <UNK> of anything i wonder if this was to save money no street scenes anywhere and we don't even see the boat except in close ups and the music what on earth was going on with playing nina <UNK> songs decades before they were out i could have done without the milk river business too but hey before you think of me as a pure <UNK> let me repeat this is a very good film with moments wonderful photography great characters and more accuracy than the usual american efforts at the <UNK> experience
<START> i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie bad characters bad story and bad acting it would be a love story between a man and a mermaid really awful
<START> excuse me but my tongue was too in my cheek when we filmed this piece <UNK> <UNK> as the evil sister with hair that <UNK> <UNK> would envy i did my very best to channel tim <UNK> in rocky horror i'm sad that this did not come across ah well a friend compared it to a <UNK> bottom budget with a white hot <UNK> ' i'll have to be content with that br br what <UNK> me is no one mentioned the endless and dull wet t shirt contest it is seriously the longest wet t shirt contest in cinema history and the only one where the contestants were wearing industrial strength <UNK> <UNK> shirts that <UNK> all efforts to get them wet and <UNK> br br and didn't anyone catch the director's cameo as the dude on the interrupted by our hero with the line <UNK> we filming yet clearly <UNK> <UNK> this is bad movie heaven for real <UNK>
<START> i went into night of the hunted not knowing what to expect at all i was really impressed br br it is essentially a mystery thriller where this girl who can't remember anything gets by a guy who happens to be driving past the two become fast friends and lovers and together they try to figure out what is going on with her through some vague flashbacks and grim memories they eventually get to the bottom of it and the ending is pretty cool br br i really liked the setting of this one a desolate post modern paris is the backdrop with lots of gray <UNK> and tall buildings very <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack and lots of nudity br br surprising it was made in 1980 seems somewhat ahead of it's time br br 8 out of 10 kids
<START> the first movie at the <UNK> festival in vegas and the most challenging it's not a movie for everyone a number of the films that followed used predictable classic horror <UNK> to tell predictable stories this picture seemed determined to do its own thing br br tom <UNK> showed some comic chops as the over the top villain he dominated every scene he was in flipping his cape about like leslie <UNK> playing dracula it was great to hear his explanation after the film he had such a good sense of humor about the role br br i was glad i didn't have too many <UNK> going in because the movie offered a lot of surprises the story was funny and <UNK> and unusual there was a lot of love <UNK> on the look most important it had a weird edge to it unlike many of the movies that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style this was a movie that used its look for a purpose br br there were a lot of movies at the <UNK> festival with bigger budgets but none that <UNK> to be this different
<START> one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore ten cents a dance stars barbara stanwyck as the dance hall girl barbara in her sixth role stanwyck looks quite plain jane in this one and opens with her getting <UNK> out by the dance hall manager then along comes rich guy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cortez who wants to <UNK> her off her feet cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the 1930s then she meets eddie who's very different from the dashing <UNK> the writer jo <UNK> had worked on some <UNK> its a wonderful life guys and dolls and gone with the wind so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru and is very similar to the bride walks out from 1936 also starring stanwyck t b w o is much more clever but also more tame due to on of the <UNK> code
<START> most of other reactions by <UNK> to this service were very apt although that some found it slow or ambiguous puzzled me rather than ambiguous it was complex and multi layered in its meanings one can see it as anti war because of the opening and closing scenes and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> as how wonderful the <UNK> men looked as they prepared for the great charge at <UNK> with its so horrible and disturbing conclusion when we see the bloody uniforms the <UNK> dead etc but <UNK> i see the film as about a moral man in an <UNK> society at the end <UNK> chooses <UNK> from the corrupt post <UNK> french world and <UNK> for the simple pleasures provided by who himself is saved by his recognition of <UNK> basic decency and the morality of his choice of white bread cheese some wine and <UNK> over the <UNK> he leaves to his wife and her and <UNK> <UNK> in her case we can see the film as also feminist in the position of women at that time in which the only weapons <UNK> <UNK> has are her charm beauty <UNK> and ultimately money
<START> alfred hitchcock's more assured telling of a film he made twenty one years earlier is infinitely superior to the original hitchcock said himself that his first version was the work of an amateur and although it certainly isn't a bad film he does appear to be right that being said this remake although definitely better still isn't among hitchcock's best work that's certainly not to say that it isn't good it's just more than a little <UNK> and that drags it down hitchcock seems all too keen to drag certain elements out and these are parts of the film that aren't entirely relevant to the plot which can become annoying some of these dragged out sequences such as the one that sees james stewart and doris day eating in a <UNK> restaurant are good because it helps establish the different culture that our american protagonists have found themselves in but for every restaurant scene there's an opera sequence and it's the latter that make the film worse br br the plot follows a middle aged doctor and his wife that go to <UNK> for a holiday with their young son while there they meet a french man on the bus and another middle aged couple in a restaurant however things go awry when the french man dies from a knife in the back shortly after <UNK> something to the doctor the holiday then turns into a full blown nightmare when the <UNK> son is kidnapped which causes them to cut it short and go to london in order to try and find him the film has a very potent degree of paranoia about it and it manages to hold this all the way through in fact i would even go as far as to say that this is the most paranoid film that hitchcock ever made like most of hitchcock's films this one is very thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire duration with only the aforementioned opera sequence standing out as a moment in which the tension is <UNK> there is also more than a little humour in the movie which gives lighthearted relief to the morbid goings on and actually works quite well br br the original version of this story was <UNK> excellent support by the fantastic peter lorre this film doesn't benefit from his presence unfortunately but that is made up for by performances from the amazing james stewart and doris day james stewart is a man that is always going to be a <UNK> for the actor of all <UNK> crown his <UNK> with hitchcock all feature <UNK> performances from him and this one is no different although his best performance remains the one in mr smith goes to washington stewart conveys all the courage conviction and <UNK> of a man that has lost his child and would do anything to get him back brilliantly in fact that's one of the best things about this film you are really able to feel for the <UNK> loss throughout and that serves in making it all the more thrilling doris day on the other hand is a rather strange casting choice for this movie she's definitely a good actress but she's more associated with musicals and seeing her in a thriller is rather odd even if she does get to <UNK> her vocal <UNK> a little br br as i've mentioned this is not hitchcock's best film but there's much to enjoy about it and although i'd recommend many hitchcock films before <UNK> this one i'll definitely give it two thumbs up as well
<START> you just need to see this as a poorly executed anti abortion propaganda and you will realize just how bad it really is the main message of this movie is that even the <UNK> of persons can't commit an abortion if you ask that's not a long way away from blowing up abortion so this guy wants to kill some poor girl but he has to convince her to do an abortion first what a load of crap and the worst part is that he has an convincing argument bringing a child into a <UNK> environment but that is supposed to be <UNK> because he's a freak anyway and the part with the bible <UNK> first they throw this girl out just because she explains someone stole her money that rule must be in the bible somewhere and then on the end they are some sort of angel like <UNK> ex <UNK> delivering the killer from evil by <UNK> him on his front yard come on other include a very confusing scenario and i don't mean in a good way so this guy is just some psycho why because his mother fed his some <UNK> once and i don't know about the rest of you but he seemed like the <UNK> person in the world throughout the whole move even though he was a wearing <UNK> clothes stealing money and <UNK> girls in his car if you forget the idiot story this movie has a really great cinematography and bob <UNK> was really great and it has one of those funny little english cars in it if it was actually about some psycho killer i'd give it a 7 at least
<START> totally brain dead <UNK> made in the <UNK> this belongs to the mode of <UNK> movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market after a rather dull beginning the movie takes off and never disappoints again it is actually a rip off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made an american prisoner in vietnam is <UNK> by the <UNK> who <UNK> a in his brain so he is <UNK> to kill the <UNK> then the president of the usa one of his old buddies played by b movie <UNK> max <UNK> is sent to stop him utterly ridiculous action scenes <UNK> acting nick <UNK> performance as the evil soviet commander is a must see and implausible plot make up for one of the <UNK> action pictures ever <UNK> in the general public
<START> ok finally a horror film that's done well as soon as i heard the music i knew that some effort had been made in creating what i consider to be an almost masterpiece of good zombies <UNK> booze grave <UNK> and a lot more a great cast well acted well directed well written there was hardly a flaw even the american actors with irish english accents really pulled it off i thought that the actor larry <UNK> looked familiar to me it was that missing tooth finally i realized that this guy was the lead in habit a film about vampires in nyc i thought he was excellent in that role now i'm wondering if he's an american or not his accent was so convincing in i sell that i thought he had to have grown up in the <UNK> <UNK> not in the us well apparently he's a born and raised new <UNK> a great actor really made the role his own in this movie nothing beats a horror flick set in early 19th century europe like the old hammer flicks i encourage anyone that wants to have a great time to watch this well crafted movie
<START> the 1973 day of the directed by fred <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> novel while not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things was nevertheless quite an above average thriller written and carried out with considerable <UNK> wit and style it remains a pleasure to rent and watch now and then br br in adapting that for the 1997 the it seems that at every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice making it all quite <UNK> overdone <UNK> <UNK> and if we put together a <UNK> of all the <UNK> that went into this movie big and small i could give you a mini <UNK> for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation ed up br br item the weapon br br in the original there is considerable intrigue over how the assassin is going to <UNK> it onto the scene how he <UNK> to disguise it and why it needs <UNK> work from his underground <UNK> in the remake they apparently thought that today's action flick raised audiences wouldn't tolerate a small rifle whose point is <UNK> and would demand the <UNK> off the black market shelf machine gun which needs a to transport it and whose point is to shout macho the whole involved and interesting business about <UNK> its <UNK> has been reduced to showing us repeatedly like this is a difficult point to follow that the <UNK> for his <UNK> high tech remote control system has been in his pocket as a pen br br item the <UNK> and motive br br without <UNK> to dry lecture the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the <UNK> the french <UNK> who could not accept that the century was moving away from <UNK> and formed the view that de had betrayed them this gives the whole plot some historical weight the remake seems to leave it as a <UNK> shootout revenge story <UNK> <UNK> it up by making them russian gangsters note please that i'm not opposed to <UNK> they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but non trivial certainly russia and the rest of ex <UNK> have been through huge changes of late and an updated story could have been <UNK> there in a way that would make us feel that it matters br br item the relationship of the assassin on the run and the police hunting him down and the complex <UNK> of the viewer's <UNK> from the bad guy to the good guy br br above i <UNK> somewhat at calling the original a masterpiece overall but in this aspect it really was one we follow along with the assassin for much of the first portions of the film and having seen his <UNK> and <UNK> we begin to admire him and not want to see his plan <UNK> or see him caught at least not too soon then we meet the policeman who gets pushed into heading up the investigation protection efforts and bit by bit we take to him and see he is not the sad sack his domestic troubles may have suggested by the time it matters we have been won over to his side br br in the remake perhaps <UNK> could have handled that sort of development but gere sure can't and the absurd 48 hours derived gimmick of the con brought out to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from br br the remake has the assassin and the assassin hunter talk about how they <UNK> like players above a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> via their moves and only able to <UNK> what the other is like that was achieved superbly in the original but in the remake in fact they're brought into face to face confrontation way too soon so they can <UNK> at each other bloody the place up and go through some fairly standard chase scenes br br item photography and scenery br br the remake does have some nice images particularly in snowy <UNK> in the opening section but the washington d c <UNK> cannot really compete with the streets of paris for interesting perspectives and <UNK> faces <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i don't cry easily over movies but i have to admit this one brought me to tears although i am not a ms streep fan her performance was excellent the title <UNK> in a sentence what a mother's love is for the first hour i didn't like any of the characters but that changed as the movie went on the movie also explained why certain <UNK> last even though there are obstacles a must see film
<START> i know what you're saying oh man is not scary but this movie goes beyond alot more than a <UNK> behind it tells the story of a mother and her daughter who is oddly attached to her doll <UNK> who seems to talk to her the only weird thing is that <UNK> else can hear the doll except her in the end is shocking revelation that as did i will shock you watch it give it a try
<START> this has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns i have ever seen having a soft spot for the genre westerns are  or were since they are no longer made very often  morality plays that too often have been <UNK> by critics with intellectual <UNK> i purchased the dvd sight unseen because i had read enough about william s <UNK> work much of which he wrote and directed to <UNK> my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection br br i must admit that i approached the actual viewing with some <UNK> my previous experiences with silent cinema classics had left me feeling let down <UNK> the phantom of the opera <UNK> birth of a nation and <UNK> the mark of zorro were fine but not nearly as good as their <UNK> would lead one to expect they were either too long or too theatrical or both br br the <UNK> gate however emerged as a pleasant surprise br br it is a story told in a simple and straightforward manner black played by hart leader of a <UNK> successful outlaw gang thinks the time has come for group to <UNK> before its luck runs out he is however opposed by his chief lieutenant jordan who them all into one last <UNK> by promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is <UNK> everyone is killed except who is taken prisoner when his <UNK> recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and <UNK> by warning an <UNK> of an impending indian attack they allow him to escape free he tries to find honest work but is <UNK> and <UNK> and ultimately must rob again to survive soon he is pursued not only by the <UNK> <UNK> but also by jordan now <UNK> from the reward money he has <UNK> and his henchmen his flight leads him to a remote cabin inhabited by a single mother and her little son after some initial <UNK> they take him into their hearts sees a chance for a new life but with the <UNK> and jordan closing in realizes that this may not be possible br br hart was the first great western star and the first to <UNK> realism into the genre as one of the <UNK> of movie making he created many of the characters and situations that have become cliché in westerns for more than ninety years what keeps his movies interesting however was his ability to go beyond the cliché perhaps his <UNK> did not go far enough so that the material appears fresh and innovative even now three such instances in the <UNK> gate illustrate this br br 1 in one scene his character shoots into a crowd in an attempt to kill jordan and kills a <UNK> instead a subsequent close up shows that he is clearly frustrated the frustration however comes not from the fact that he has <UNK> down a man who had <UNK> caused him no harm but that he missed his intended target br br 2 in another as he <UNK> from the <UNK> his borrowed horse steps into a <UNK> hole and breaks a leg hart pulls out his gun to put the animal out of its misery but before pulling the trigger gives his head a sad loving pat as if to say farewell to an old friend br br 3 and finally after he has <UNK> jordan and thrown his body over a cliff he returns to retrieve his guns and spots his pistol lying on the ground nearby he steps forward and gives it a swift kick before <UNK> his horse it is a simple gesture but it <UNK> the deep loathing he feels for the man who betrayed him and his <UNK> br br and i love the title the <UNK> gate it is <UNK> in its <UNK> that a man cannot begin a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old one <UNK> comes in the form of sacrifice today's more sophisticated audiences may not buy into that sentiment entirely but it can still work on you if you let it br br viewers who like their videos in <UNK> condition will undoubtedly object to the dvd's picture quality especially the badly <UNK> final reel i don't mind at all that a copy of this <UNK> movie even exists at all is a miracle since <UNK> of so many other silent movies have been lost if you bear that in mind and look upon the film as a piece of history its visual flaws are not that difficult to accept br br william s hart was born in <UNK> in new york but grew up in the <UNK> and <UNK> where he learned to speak <UNK> and indian sign language he counted <UNK> <UNK> and bat masterson among his friends and <UNK> <UNK> paintings so his knowledge of the west was first hand if his vision seems overly <UNK> by today's standards it is nevertheless <UNK> far closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the '60s and '70s and the <UNK> works that followed both the star and his films are <UNK> for re <UNK>
<START> let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts and i do indeed know they exist i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there br br what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this people forget there is more than one bible thousands of <UNK> and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible not everyone believes in god and not everyone believes in <UNK> typical religion br br religion does not make everything fact one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible <UNK> is breaking the very rules written within you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time slavery is ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances none of this oh that was the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible is the word of god and cannot be changed there should be no changes or versions religion is full of <UNK> mixed facts and people who so <UNK> follow it that there is no other way the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the <UNK> properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their <UNK> or teacher br br but anyhow onto the review i am a decent fan of ghost hunters and when i heard this show was coming soon i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential as much as i like watching ghost hunters i do not like some of their members and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not i am glad they are skeptical but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your <UNK> and film does not make the place haunted or not if ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as a fact not a belief it's more of a right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think it's going to perform for you this show is kind of silly it's usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of <UNK> yet hardly anything happens the main guy's <UNK> narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not needed br br also the <UNK> on <UNK> is too <UNK> as i believe very few of them are actually gifted <UNK> brown is one i definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believe br br i really wanted to like this show but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed
<START> first of all ed wood jr is not the worst director ever plan 9 from outer space not <UNK> coleman francis deserves that title i present exhibit b <UNK> or glenda br br the first half of the movie consists of a surprisingly thoughtful exploration of especially since it was made in 1953 the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well br br this is not to say the movie doesn't have problems bela lugosi was totally <UNK> odd lines poor bela looked like even he wasn't sure what was happening at times the acting was wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre more like a vaguely menacing <UNK> film than a dream sequence the alan ann story the supposed original focus of the film has a tacked on quality about it br br no ed wood jr is not the worst director ever he was able at least for part of this movie to make an earnest social statement when coleman francis tried to do that in night train to <UNK> fine aka red zone cuba it just ended in chaos <UNK> or glenda is at least watchable without robot help
<START> nothing but the director's juvenile fantasy come to life this <UNK> is nothing more than an excuse for the director actor to play <UNK> face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of day br br the plot is simple the direction is nonexistent and the movie drags while the actor director writer narrator <UNK> don't be fooled by the <UNK> rating there is no nudity and minimal gore
<START> to qualify my use of realistic in the summary not many old folks i know go around pretending to be famous blind people etc nor have i ever been elderly those minor issues out of the way the relationships between the characters in this film and the emotions expressed <UNK> were completely realistic and genuine in fact though we're not yet 30 i could see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife in the interactions between the main character and his wife for those that don't die young there's a great line in the movie about this when the two best friends are talking about dying young and one of them says and i'm <UNK> we missed our chance we'll just have to stick it out we'll all be where these characters are some day i know many movie goers would prefer to be swept away from reality as opposed to being faced with it but even they might enjoy the sweet reminder of our <UNK> and the importance of living life to the <UNK> that this film is
<START> it's funny because i read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction you'll probably either love it or hate it too i think the best films are the ones that <UNK> people because obviously they have some kind of impact i'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about afghanistan and iraq i have to admit that i was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place especially afghanistan and i feel guilty about that the music through the movie was beautiful i kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks personally i thought the audio was great it seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the <UNK> with jim the main character or in his head everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio anyway this is a very amazing dvd which made me cry
<START> i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store wondering if i should give it a shot today i broke down and gave it a <UNK> and i probably shouldn't have br br while the writer director did give the film a respectable effort it fell far short of engaging the characters while you wanted to feel for them just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them <UNK> sexual <UNK> got <UNK> fast i don't mind sex in films and i don't mind bitchy characters but being a bad girl doesn't mean you're prone to <UNK> ask people at random if they'd like sexual <UNK> by the time what happened to the characters was revealed i was bored and ready to fast forward to the climax the end anything exciting and nothing delivered the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic and just wasn't played quite right if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there i might have been interested this should have been a more of a suspense drama film and should have stuck to the title jon <UNK> wife rather than the whole red right hand and horror film like cover hell this should have had suspense period br br either way watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television though this isn't as great as i'd hoped i would go for this over some <UNK>
<START> i suggest if you have already seen the original american <UNK> do not see this movie if you haven't seen the original i still don't recommend this but it will be a lot less painful to watch the characters from the first film are great and by the end you fell a connection to them this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become it's a chore to watch br br set on new year's eve in 1964 <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> we have four stories about the characters from the first film in we have john <UNK> paul le <UNK> who is now a professional drag <UNK> he meets a foreign girl eva and though his plot really goes nowhere it's the best of the four in 1965 we have <UNK> charles martin smith who is stuck in vietnam and more than anything he wants out he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out in <UNK> we have debbie candy clark the girl who <UNK> picked up in the first movie now she is a pot smoking hippie and really i'm not sure what her plot was about it was her going to a concert not much of anything happened finally in 1967 steve ron howard and laurie cindy williams are having marriage problems that end in a anti war <UNK> and police action br br none of these stories are very good the script in some parts features very very bad dialogue these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film ended up where they are here why why was this sequel made i guess if a sequel was made it had to feature the vietnam war and hippies and police action but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't have been made br br the direction was stylish but it just amounts in a huge headache each story has a different style is just a regular depending on how you watch it wide screen and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be plot was shot in <UNK> and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen <UNK> plot is shot in multi screen at one point there might have been one screen but for the good majority it's anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once don't bother trying to follow the screens since there's nothing going on anyways steve and <UNK> plot has the <UNK> filming style it's style really doesn't mean anything and is dumb and pointless instead of just a full widescreen it's a <UNK> widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen though i don't like the others at least i understand what they were going for this one just doesn't make sense br br the music is this movie's saving grace not that it could save this bob dylan simon and <UNK> wonder marvin <UNK> and dozens of others have nice songs featured here they don't save the feature they just make it a little better than it is it's still bad br br overall this is a pointless sequel any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel br br my rating 1 2 out of <UNK> mins pg for language drug use and violence
<START> given christopher <UNK> string of successful films it's a no <UNK> for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the <UNK> that has made him a master filmmaker and <UNK> br br though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy who starts a <UNK> obsession with following random people he <UNK> on the streets in a <UNK> manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break them br br he meets up with charismatic <UNK> alex <UNK> who turns out to be a <UNK> with peculiar sensibilities and <UNK> <UNK> and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and <UNK> about their <UNK> <UNK> as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a <UNK> <UNK> who rejects his every advance br br told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don't quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan <UNK> that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets <UNK> delivered there are enough twists here which <UNK> the film into a <UNK> <UNK> where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through br br it's also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on <UNK> i guess here's an example of a successful <UNK> humble roots which should serve as inspiration and <UNK> new filmmakers out there now i'll <UNK> wait for christopher <UNK> <UNK> due out later this year whose trailer is already such a <UNK>
<START> cover girl is a <UNK> wwii musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it save for its signature song long ago and far away this film came out before gene kelly really hit his artistic <UNK> and while there are <UNK> of his <UNK> talent here mostly he plays sidekick to rita hayworth and there's the problem rita hayworth is gorgeous no doubt about that but she's simply not a compelling screen presence i've always found myself wanting to like her more than i actually do and this movie is no exception she's simply not a very good actress and she's not even a very good dancer good looking as she is there's something vapid about her and this movie suffers because of it br br grade c
<START> you know i always fancy disturbing or strange movies especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in <UNK> germany but <UNK> cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year will this comment contain any spoilers br br no because i just did not understand this movie but well what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd we the guys from the festival know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end br br i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong <UNK> language but this there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one but why what is the director trying to tell us is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster who knows i do not br br if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time watch it but <UNK> expect to think wow i got the message i did not get it
<START> i was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world a hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and extended family of companion workers created a person able to succeed in the world for the most part the hispanic culture is shown as i have always observed and admired <UNK> optimistic and truly family oriented the points of religious <UNK> were quite authentic to the catholic church without a doubt the actress who played the mother deserves an academy award her <UNK> for her missing son moved me to tears i will recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family
<START> <UNK> is a big crowded city between europe and asia too many types of people living together there for hundred years in this documentary movie you can see how music can give description about the culture of the owner race br br you would be able to hear too many types of music including rock hip hop alternative and more some of the musicians are famous in turkey some of them are famous also in europe the rest are just street musicians their music tell viewers different faces of a city br br impressive
<START> <UNK> <UNK> lyrical <UNK> captures the <UNK> <UNK> that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering beautifully photographed by aaron <UNK> that is more vibe than narrative caught somewhere between documentary and dream recalls the <UNK> of early todd <UNK> and the vivid of gus van <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it's kinda like the movie equivalent of <UNK> youth playing <UNK> pop
<START> to be frank this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the jazz singer the <UNK> version is really a silent movie despite its build up as the first <UNK> br br danny thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well he does the jewish stuff with feeling peggy lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining allan <UNK> is not too entertaining and we could have done without him one question since when do live in such <UNK> houses
<START> i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could the writers were <UNK> on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show these characters were so real one could tell that from the two main actresses ms <UNK> ms <UNK> that their relationship on off camera was genuine it didn't just end when you hear those familiar words cut at the end of a take the show has thought me a lot about life for e g historical struggles <UNK> and <UNK> relationships every day situations every household have same situations no matter who the members are it really came down to just being a wonderful family show that at the end of every episode you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this particular episode br br i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again br br now you know why i gave it a 10
<START> quentin tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry you had to make your own pulp fiction or <UNK> dogs writer actor director larry bishop seems to have taken that advice a little too literally with hell ride and <UNK> a messy homage that borrows much too heavily in its visuals music camera work and time <UNK> storytelling but to properly <UNK> a tarantino film one has to have a knack for <UNK> creative conversations unfortunately hell primary element is its atrocious <UNK> and vulgar monologues that only work to disgust and confuse the audience while simultaneously <UNK> pity for the actors just for being involved br br the anti hero protagonist biker gang the <UNK> consists of several <UNK> <UNK> who bring their own brand of <UNK> justice to the <UNK> roads the leader larry bishop is hell bent on revenge and putting out fires the <UNK> michael madsen just tries to balance his chaotic psychotic <UNK> of life with putting lead into anyone who crosses his boss and <UNK> eric <UNK> follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past br br on the villainous front <UNK> david carradine is the mastermind who <UNK> from <UNK> though not quite far enough and billy wings <UNK> jones <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> explanations for his <UNK> while <UNK> a <UNK> gun and a general disdain for life while these characters might sound interesting on paper once they're forced to rant <UNK> ill conceived dialogue all <UNK> of cool disappear faster than the funding should for <UNK> next film br br while hell ride is <UNK> with <UNK> and missed opportunities the main <UNK> of its <UNK> lies in the poorly <UNK> conversations and because <UNK> main influences are the talky films of tarantino there are a lot of them the first twenty minutes of the movie are nearly <UNK> and would probably make as much sense muted by the time main squeeze is introduced and certain phrases are <UNK> to the point of <UNK> you'll pray for both death and the ability to turn the sound off even dennis hopper has trouble remaining cool while <UNK> off such goofy dialogue br br have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it just doesn't sound right or even make sense anymore bishop starts there and then keeps the madness going until you envy the characters on screen getting their heads cut off and when the dialogue finally takes a break we're treated to interspersed shots of nude female oil wrestling and throats being <UNK> i'm not sure what effect bishop hoped to <UNK> but i doubt he found it br br hell ride wants to pay homage to quentin tarantino films robert rodriguez films and every movie that <UNK> the violent and devil may care attitudes of <UNK> but while its intentions may be noble the <UNK> cringe worthy dialogue and the hyper stylized <UNK> <UNK> editing <UNK> the audience from becoming invested with the generic tough guy characters by the time we figure out the mystery behind the characters' motives and it may be awhile before you even realize there's a mystery to be solved it's just too hard to care anymore and while everyone on screen is clearly having fun they've entirely neglected to translate any of that entertainment to the audience br br joel
<START> now that's it's 2008 who really has a care in the world about a guy like <UNK> <UNK> even back then he wasn't a big deal br br two tickets to paradise is an <UNK> story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances again a proved plot the problem with this film other than it's <UNK> bad it's title is the script br br cliché after cliché three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie and blow up <UNK> house br br john c acting job is superb especially compared to that of the late <UNK> <UNK> his career is dead hence the late though i hear he's moving to tv good for him also john c likely has the least awful character in the film br br the score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993 or jeff <UNK> movie now you know also set me back a few years but at least that was more entertaining i mean <UNK> i guess i enjoyed parts of it but the nerdy guy is annoying <UNK> tries to be this cool failed guitar player with some rough influences like some of the worst of classic rock who has some strange relationship with a stripper and john c is a <UNK> who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his henchmen br br i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start br br but as i've hinted this whole time it's not the worst movie ever and any chance i have to see <UNK> in a starring role i'll take it hopefully he starts getting some better projects
<START> this is an excellent documentary about <UNK> i enjoyed it very much it's very well put together and very informative if you want to know who is <UNK> i highly recommend you see this film the art of <UNK> br br
<START> return of the seven has a few good action scenes and elmer <UNK> score is as rousing as ever nevertheless it's a boring film because it simply fails to involve us emotionally <UNK> absence makes a really bad impression and the fact that his character here is played by a different little known actor is odd in a bad way the characters are not developed so we don't connect with them and we hardly care when some of them die this sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original
<START> its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s but its true here another clumsy attempt <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> would be viewers with admirable <UNK> while successfully <UNK> those of us who have actually read the story <UNK> original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time or pad the bust line of the old girl with <UNK> detail the latter is what is attempted here and if i may say <UNK> so unimaginative and thoroughly modern new <UNK> to character personalities such as religious in <UNK> or <UNK> in good old <UNK> bones ruin the story's intent and <UNK> a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers by the time the <UNK> famous climax approached i had completely lost interest its the kind of film where you expect to see a <UNK> smoking in the background
<START> the first feature length muppet movie and <UNK> maybe the muppet christmas carol the movie the world over are still looking for as a guide disney has done the muppets a <UNK> service and this movie proves it over and over again featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos keeps to a simple but original plot classic muppet lame jokes paul williams genius in song writing and electric mayhem madness and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets only <UNK> has come close to genius with puppets half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor actress still alive i can only hope frank oz and dave <UNK> and the rest of the surviving <UNK> can somehow rescue and revive <UNK> and company from the deadly grasp of disney
<START> without doubt a great all round show that if shown today would attract a huge following <UNK> was only 6 episodes and a trailer but deserved a few more series to really bring it up to speed with outstanding performances from the highly talented and versatile sean pertwee and the dynamic louise lombard it really did put it up with the likes of the the <UNK> and thief <UNK> the story lines are based on the <UNK> protection services and with great filming and story lines and scene locations it stood out from some of the junk that gets <UNK> by other tv production companies i do not think that it has been shown on <UNK> tv either such as sky or <UNK> witch is a shame as if it were to be shown nowadays i am sure it would get a large viewing audience so i hope one day the guys at <UNK> tv decide to release it on dvd cheers nick
<START> god did i hate this movie i saw it at a sneak preview 13 years ago and i still have bad flashbacks it was without a doubt the worst movie i ever paid to see it was badly written badly directed and surprisingly considering the cast badly acted i would rather be thrown off a <UNK> onto razor sharp <UNK> and then have my skin <UNK> off than to sit through it again can you guess i didn't enjoy it
<START> i was in <UNK> grade and this movie aired on <UNK> during a series called ' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end in the film jesse the main character forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie due to a very simple but <UNK> mistake one of the pair dies at the time i found the story very powerful because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues br br last year i finally <UNK> down a vhs copy of the show i probably should have stuck with my memories watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories br br many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this film as an adult
<START> this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular but who's complaining it's always fun to see the poor <UNK> try various <UNK> to get the road runner and then get <UNK> by every one of those <UNK> br br the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever it gave us an <UNK> view of the chase in a <UNK> like structure i didn't say it was hilarious just different from the normal above ground antics br br this one along with some other road runner shorts are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 and the <UNK> of them are spectacular the colors are magnificent
<START> a fine young cast is wasted in this empty <UNK> manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both a cute comedy and an insightful drama the plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seems endless as characters do nothing but <UNK> and <UNK> the dialogue is filled with stilted cliches and fortune cookie attempts at pseudo philosophy br br apparently aiming at being a moving and profound look at life and love the film ends up being merely pretentious the only real weight is the burden that the talented cast is forced to carry as best they can but never fear they are held up by the puppet strings of the contrived plot
<START> this is probably the best cinematic depiction of life in a manhattan ad agency the pressure to perform client and agency demands the parties the creativity the money the cool surface with powerful corporate <UNK> br br toss in <UNK> for dustin hoffman br br the movie is <UNK> and deep it follows his internal relationship as he tries to understand and live with what's going on his relationship with meryl streep and her friend who becomes his friend and his the relationship with his son br br while meryl streep was great did she set the record for least screen time to win an oscar she sure can deliver when she is on though
<START> the most die hard <UNK> of john wayne will cringe when they watch the <UNK> frontier even for a poverty row studio this one is one <UNK> br br unusual for a western we have a criminal who is a sex crime <UNK> earl plays a <UNK> white and indian who for reasons that are not explained pretends he's a mexican hokey accent and all sounds like the of advertising fame back in the day br br he and his gang happen upon <UNK> hayes and his daughter sheila terry they really don't have anything worth robbing but just wants an excuse to kidnap terry and have his way with her she hears the <UNK> fate she has in store and she and hayes flee the ranch br br where they happen to meet john wayne who's on the trail of the <UNK> they also run into one very stupid sheriff who believes wayne is one of the <UNK> again for reasons i can't quite <UNK> br br it was a tough way to earn a living <UNK> out horse operas like these for the duke fortunately better things were on the way
<START> <UNK> the thing br br to see a horror film in which not only is every character over the age of thirty but distinctly unattractive makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times when actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability to play realistic characters rather than because of their teen appeal on a magazine cover and carpenter chooses a production designer and a cinematographer who can actually create realistic <UNK> rather than over <UNK> parodies and there's no <UNK> <UNK> ending or cameo celebrity appearance or lame pseudo romantic subplot br br and i really miss on set physical effects with all those 20 year old kids trying out crazy new ideas with <UNK> of blood and <UNK> and early <UNK> in the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw alien the elephant man <UNK> the howling an american werewolf in london the thing the company of wolves a nightmare on elm street what an era for horror effects and don't get me started on the death of <UNK> painting the <UNK> work in this movie is beautiful and <UNK> br br what do we have now third rate cgi former music video directors and professional that makes even <UNK> horror movies look like glossy mtv videos br br now i'm going to go netflix 'the
<START> where do i begin i sat down ready to laugh a bit and i was blown away this movie is just perfect it's <UNK> jackass number two in all honesty was <UNK> more obscene funnier and more entertaining than the first this was just what i needed tonight br br there are so many scenes in this movie that will make you say oh my no way or <UNK> perfectly <UNK> and set up each event and scene were <UNK> way before and therefore made it even more perfect i loved every minute of it i'm just going to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to <UNK> particular footage in order to prevent an <UNK> 17 rating it was so hilarious that they had to put it in anyway amazingly good br br 9 10 incredibly funny do not miss out
<START> if you want to see a film with no guns blood sex shouting angry people hero bad guys girls or even clumsy love words and you want to see a film in which every shot has the meaning of love this one is a must see film for me i've been waiting for a film like this all of my life
<START> calling this a sunday school movie might be generous because even as a christian i found the religious message so one dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church the message is read your bible go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't get left behind at the rapture there was no love i guess when you get right down to it i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula br br aside from the spiritual religious element the script was tedious saying the same thing over and over that might have been to make up for some of the acting which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time so they just said the same thing over and over br br i did enjoy the final scenes i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or <UNK> to a sunday school formula the movie wasn't all bad just most of it br br i am in favor of more clean movies that are well done and that present truth in a non preachy way this wasn't one of those i am sorry to say i took my family to this film wanting to support that kind of movie now i'd like my money back
<START> a brief history of time the <UNK> content of this documentary is fascinating the thoughts provoking and the man brilliant yet i had a hard time enjoying this documentary br br the way the family members and <UNK> are interviewed feels so unnatural these members were interviewed on specifically built sets and were directed <UNK> mostly their accounts came across as very acted and <UNK> directed the deliberate non inclusion of asked questions <UNK> the given information into a very harsh and <UNK> format br br i do not know who are <UNK> for the <UNK> but they did a dreadful job and with that took away from the viewing experience br br overall still a fascinating documentary well worth seeing if only for the interesting concepts presented
<START> this film is unbelievable on any level it fails as an action film because no one would be fooled for a moment that the props actors and scenery are realistic it fails because even the most <UNK> ho would see through the hollow <UNK> portrayed by the film a <UNK> might is right mentality
<START> i can't remember the series i believe it may have been american masters but it was broadcast on <UNK> around 1980 most people have some knowledge of the development of the a bomb and those that have little or none probably think it is a pretty dry subject anyone who has viewed this 7 part series does not feel that way you get to know the turmoil in mind and how the development changed his life forever you understand the tragic figure he became and why with 7 episodes you get to know the major players and the intrigue and <UNK> i have <UNK> <UNK> about the chance of <UNK> a video or dvd but have never received a response too bad i would love to see it again
<START> lt claude <UNK> <UNK> and several prisoners from his <UNK> ship wash <UNK> on an island owned by <UNK> richard johnson following a few random prisoner deaths takes in claude and his two remaining prisoners luckily for everyone barbara bach just happens to be on the island too <UNK> there are some crazy who like to kill people br br this italian produced <UNK> seems to have it all a touch of creature from the black <UNK> mixed with dr <UNK> with a dash of white zombie voodoo and atlantis stuff despite some <UNK> looking costumes the film does benefit from some beautiful location photography and a nice twist about halfway through all of the actors are good and joseph <UNK> even pops up as a old <UNK> director sergio martino handles himself well enough as there is action ever 10 minutes or so that can't be said for his <UNK> follow up the and their queen 1995 easily one of the and most off base sequels since <UNK> ii
<START> br br excellent i have to think back a very long time to find a film that's made me laugh quite so much the writing is top notch the story is satisfying and the entire cast is excellent chris <UNK> has never been better one of the very best comedies of the 90s
<START> dr seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of <UNK> we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat big mistake myers proves he can't act in this film he acts like a <UNK> show girl with a thousand tricks up his <UNK> the kids in this movie are all right somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying the story is just like the original with a couple of <UNK> and like most movies based on other stories never <UNK> with the original story bringing in the evil neighbor <UNK> was a bad idea he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it the film sure does look tacky sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the <UNK> goes off before he says a naughty word mildly funny at least the grinch had <UNK> and the film was actually good this film is a cartoonish piece of <UNK> with bright colors and bad mediocre acting was mike myers even in this movie actually and another thing the fish what is with that stupid fish first time you see him he's an actual fish next time you see him he's all animated and talking but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play <UNK> this film is a total off target wreck good joke bad joke bad bad bad good joke i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke that was good so please if you have the choice watch the grinch instead of this mess
<START> sure most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the br br celluloid they were filmed on but this video nightmare may well be br br the <UNK> produced br br six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping of course br br and you know this already they begin getting killed one by one by a br br mysterious stranger the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to br br get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes <UNK> br br bait br br john carl my least favorite b movie guy did the lousy br br makeup effects here the cast features <UNK> <UNK> of the br br witches of and the <UNK> family movies sadly he br br does not pop up until the very end of the film and is covered in br br burn makeup rendering him <UNK> steve bond anyone br br remember him is here in an early role as a victim br br <UNK> direction and the script he both smell like the br br presents brown bears leave in the woods he <UNK> the film with br br so much stock wilderness footage i thought i accidentally rented a br br special episode of mutual of <UNK> wild kingdom much of the br br cast sits around the <UNK> and eats then walk and sit and eat br br again the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put br br in a slasher film he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a br br baby deer jackie <UNK> who must have forgot he once worked br br with the legends of silent cinema has two scenes and is involved br br in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film he and br br the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about <UNK> and br br cream cheese <UNK> on <UNK> bread yeah br br there is not one minute of suspense here the killer a forest fire br br survivor looking for a mate watches the students from behind br br trees we know it is the killer because the film makers have br br dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that <UNK> serves to wake br br the viewer up every few minutes skip this pile of <UNK> <UNK> and rent br br halloween instead br br this is rated r for physical violence mild gun violence gore br br some profanity brief female nudity mild sexual content sexual br br references and drug abuse
<START> guy <UNK> looks like and acts like a <UNK> <UNK> underwear model or one of those bimbo guys who wear <UNK> and stand in front of a herd of <UNK> buffalo because they realize that buffalo like too in every scene guy <UNK> looks like he is saying look at me i am so pretty as a hero his character is a total <UNK> in every scene that calls for courage <UNK> gets the short end of the stick spoilers yet at the end of the movie this <UNK> book worm character out runs a pack of <UNK> like who can run and leap along the side of the walls like <UNK> around the same time the time machine seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some kind that <UNK> out an entire valley strangely even though <UNK> and his gal pal are about a foot away from the last that gets killed seconds later <UNK> and the tribe are watching the valley blow up from the safety of their mountain now that is fast running jeremy <UNK> as the king of the is great he really makes the movie a lot better than it was the model turned actress is not very cute and she does not do much acting in this movie the scenes which take place in the <UNK> lack any real atmosphere even though the period dress and vehicles are shown the characters act like caricatures of how they imagine <UNK> people would walk and talk the original version of this movie was a lot better in this respect the period characters were much more realistic and they were much better actors the original version of this movie made the past seem like the real base of the characters this new version lacks substance and feeling the scenes in which <UNK> deals with the death of emma and then fails to save her from her fate are very good the issue of the being cannibals is not very well explained and it does not make sense that they have some large dark butcher shop filled with knives and <UNK> yet they are never seen using any weapons except for a blow <UNK> also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones all through the underground the are all walking around chewing on <UNK> bones so how can all those <UNK> be in the pit it seems like there are some that bar b <UNK> their humans and eat them off the <UNK> and other only like <UNK> flesh and where are the <UNK> for all of these creatures as i was watching the dozens of who were <UNK> themselves on human flesh it occurred to me that they must have a very advanced toilet <UNK> system considering that they were <UNK> in lots of bones all these issues were never addressed at the end of the movie <UNK> is holding hand but you can see that he is eye <UNK> her friend <UNK> one other totally irritating thing about this movie is the non stop lion king music which is in the background once <UNK> arrives in the future a d the lion king music never stops and every time the natives are around there is that african <UNK> singer is it peter gabriel or paul simon that starts <UNK> and <UNK> over the lion king jungle music i watched the credits at the end of the movie and the jungle music is not specifically identified but i think that <UNK> john should probably look into this matter time machine was a mediocre movie with some good fx see it once then forget it
<START> i thought puppets making <UNK> phone calls was pretty low but i don't believe that carlos <UNK> show even qualifies as comedy his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word as many times as he possible can i have never felt compelled to write a review <UNK> the awfulness of anything on imdb before but i really do hope this show is never <UNK> or <UNK> br br <UNK> is trying to be the next dave <UNK> and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes it is obvious right down to the rip of intro blues guys vs <UNK> band however <UNK> has absolutely no attitude and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time instead he sticks to a small number of hardly shocking <UNK> for his fellow <UNK> and makes jokes about <UNK> every once in a while he'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else like middle eastern cultures these jokes mainly consist of <UNK> every joke or stereotype made against the culture and perhaps some incredibly old topics such as 9 11 in a watered down stand up style while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience's style i think he's too afraid of really <UNK> anyone so it just makes the viewer feel awkward he also beats jokes to death if you've ever seen why the f is this news you'll know what i'm talking about it's funny at first but he just <UNK> on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point br br it's a <UNK> that is purely painful to watch
<START> cops logan alexander and debbie <UNK> <UNK> five black juvenile <UNK> cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down after a deadly run in with a racist white trash bitch with a shotgun played by the director the survivors take <UNK> in the house of a blind voodoo <UNK> one of the teens <UNK> uses a spell to call up <UNK> who finally shows up about <UNK> through this bore in a <UNK> make up job and bigger <UNK> that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while <UNK> some of the worst one liners heard since <UNK> <UNK> was canceled br br the acting from the teens is terrible the dialogue even worse the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films <UNK> <UNK> trying to imitate jim carrey here is awful and no match for the <UNK> <UNK> of angel vargas in <UNK> 1 which at least had a few dumb laughs br br yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios whose reputation as a fun direct to <UNK> franchise has completely <UNK> since the <UNK> puppet master days
<START> this really is the worst movie i have ever seen for a while i made a habit of watching lousy movies including battlefield earth <UNK> force <UNK> and starship all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to br br there isn't much point in <UNK> this piece of junk i think it's more <UNK> to <UNK> my reaction to the movie which is as follows i become <UNK> angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after roughly 80 minutes of play br br i rate this movie a 0 but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than 1 i give it a 0 knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely many times better than this one that's really how bad it is
<START> in a very near future world a corrupt government <UNK> everyone constantly with computers and <UNK> one man has managed to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> outside the system fighting to <UNK> his freedom an engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work there are some confusing and slow parts but all in all an excellent example of what a small crew with brains and talent can do on a <UNK> budget
<START> 6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching so let me <UNK> the balance br br if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry unfortunately for me that was <UNK> minutes i'll never see again and hopefully i'll save some of you from wasting <UNK> minutes of your own br br whilst the idea behind the film is interesting it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached the student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won't care about what happens to them the soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film i kept waiting for captain to <UNK> an imaginary <UNK> some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting poor script writing and <UNK> camera work the budget may have been better spent sending the actors and i use that term loosely to acting classes or the thomas brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell <UNK> because the subtitles were <UNK> <UNK> the fact that the <UNK> were not picked up on and <UNK> speaks volumes about the <UNK> of the whole production br br i can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers either that or they were watching a completely different film i <UNK> the thomas brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field they will surely <UNK> to death
<START> what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed <UNK> <UNK> film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since <UNK> remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re visit their <UNK> formula for establishing ratings since an 8 8 rating for this piece of <UNK> matter is absurd i am by no means a <UNK> and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70's 80's but this is inferior product even by the <UNK> standards of the then illegal <UNK> loop
<START> i first watched <UNK> in 1987 along with another movie called <UNK> waves i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again br br however i have recently started a <UNK> to collect as many 80's horror titles in their original <UNK> form that have been deleted for some time i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list br br the <UNK> although i have not as yet got a copy is high <UNK> as all the old movies i didn't like back then i now own and have now re watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the <UNK> are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a s a p br br <UNK> for the 80's and long live horror
<START> i loved this movie and i watch it everyday i think that although the acting isn't all that great it's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script i had been looking all over for this movie for almost a year and when i found it for thirty dollars i just had to get it it is now by far my favorite movie of all time it deals with relationship failure and at the same time making a joke of it i loved all the parts with don <UNK> especially the one where asks him for a <UNK> when they're sitting on the <UNK> and he tells him to eat the one rolling down the <UNK> it really portrays him as he really is the part in the making of really touched me when they brandon <UNK> addiction to heroin and how much his friends and family were trying to help him a new movie that's in the making called is in production which is about the story of <UNK> dreams <UNK> by his addiction
<START> just about every <UNK> has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is over the concert footage in places this is true and is the biggest flaw of this film however it isn't so often or so bad that one shouldn't see this video if you are a black <UNK> fan you have to see this aside from having seen black <UNK> in the and early eighties i saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also <UNK> just like in this video the concert was amazing and very much like this which was why i rented this in the first place it's just about the best <UNK> rock out there check it out
<START> stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains right so why give the stooges only <UNK> minutes i'm not asking for a <UNK> mini series but would a two <UNK> had killed anyone the movie <UNK> over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been <UNK> i do want to give a <UNK> to the performances of the stars they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the stooges but the spirit was there after watching the movie i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly the movie was pretty tough emotionally especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going when <UNK> started crying i lost it like i said the movie was good but could have been and should have been much much better maybe it's fitting though the stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now 25 years later it happens again
<START> <UNK> is a hardcore rock band from des <UNK> <UNK> nine band members who all wear <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> masks <UNK> <UNK> clown mask <UNK> various <UNK> <UNK> torn mask with <UNK> the music itself seems to walk the between sane and otherwise yet is performed so brilliantly and psychotic br br welcome to our neighborhood sounds rather a generic title but the footage itself is something else interviews with the band <UNK> from their latest album 2 live performances and one banned by mtv music video a brilliant homage to the classic kubrick film the shining the movie <UNK> in at not even half an hour but is certainly worth it it is perfect for introducing any metal hardcore fan to <UNK>
<START> one dark night has a typical teen horror film set up with a quite a unique twist the ultra brooding musical score and gothic claustrophobic atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that delivers meg <UNK> is excellent as julie and leads us through the <UNK> of the <UNK> giving a sense of foreboding and loneliness the other teens are equally effective in their roles as is melissa newman the ultimate heroine of the film the special effects are excellent though dated this film is highly overlooked but that may be good so that it was never ruined by endless sequels there is a great dark magic flowing through this film once <UNK> into you really get it and you're in for some fun the double disc dvd is available though the original negative could not be found to <UNK> the film maybe someday it will be located i guess in some ways the <UNK> in parts do help the film by giving it an old school <UNK> and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are plenty of effects br br the second disc has a rough cut alternate version with a <UNK> score version of the film that gives more explanation of the demise of two of the girls very poe ish the <UNK> of <UNK> comes to mind in a new way also great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening not sure it had the punch for main stream audiences but certainly worked for me and extremely creepy also there is a making of documentary that is interesting because it gives info on what was going on at the time with the actors crew director and writer <UNK> material then current <UNK> discussions of shots and scenes <UNK> very unique that this stuff exists for a small film back then
<START> this is a wonderful film as a film it gets an 8 out of 10 as a filmed piece of accurate history one wishes to be more loving but it is a 5 out of 10 and i think i am actually being very <UNK> br br what was he like that man of horse and <UNK> who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bloody handed ambitious clever too clever indian <UNK> indian friend and national hero his death in <UNK> was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington lincoln jackson and grant lee and <UNK> jackson it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career the overly ambitious hot <UNK> that his reputation <UNK> yet to this day george armstrong <UNK> remains the best <UNK> figure in our <UNK> military <UNK> to lose his last battle i can't really think of a similar one maybe general jonathan <UNK> forced to stay with his men on the <UNK> death march but <UNK> survived the march and the second world war br br <UNK> has appeared in more films than far better <UNK> due to the western adventures and little big horn pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as <UNK> walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film but even in 1941 the legend was still potent olivia de <UNK> portrayed <UNK> <UNK> who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until 1933 so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later <UNK> was seen as our <UNK> but brave knight <UNK> and with the shadow of world war ii <UNK> closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth john ford would have fully understood this and <UNK> it br br so we get the view that he was a hot <UNK> but he was patriotic although almost pushed out of west point by which was true <UNK> was in the class of <UNK> and it would have been really stupid to be <UNK> about such a fighter that year you see most of the so called military talent from west point from robert e lee down was southern and joined the <UNK> the union needed every northern point man they could find br br <UNK> civil war career should be given closer study he was attached to the staff of general in chief george b and distinguished himself in the <UNK> campaign and other eastern front <UNK> but he was a <UNK> and he would rise under the <UNK> eyes of grant and <UNK> buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of <UNK> creek which ended the threat of the <UNK> in the valley it also hit <UNK> hard on a personal level his close west point friend stephen joined the <UNK> and rose to a position like <UNK> <UNK> wounded <UNK> sat with all through the <UNK> last night alive br br following the war things fell apart he wanted to make his <UNK> major permanent it wasn't as it was a battlefield promotion they only had a lt to give him in the <UNK> army along the frontier he tried to play politics making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in and finding most <UNK> hated johnson as an inept idiot he supposedly admired the indians he certainly was <UNK> in writing of them and the west but he caused a genuine military massacre in of indian women and children that ended with a court martial later during the <UNK> he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians that went up to the secretary of war william <UNK> who bought and sold indian <UNK> <UNK> for profit it ruined <UNK> and left a black eye on the grant administration it put him into the with grant and <UNK> who was former commander and sheridan barely saved his career then he was sent on the final big horn campaign and <UNK> arrived br br that career is worth a real film but would it be too critical should we hold a man of the <UNK> <UNK> to the standards of 2007 would we like that done to us in a hundred years certainly it could happen but i'm not sure we'd like it br br <UNK> 1941 style fit flynn like a <UNK> with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films his final movie with olivia de <UNK> is <UNK> with a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character in support actors like sidney <UNK> stanley arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends <UNK> or even <UNK> <UNK> kennedy as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be
<START> this must be the first movie i've rented and not seen to the end complete garbage the acting the plot set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot not even a b move
<START> we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6 30 a m while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on it is absolutely adorable we need shows like this for children and adults as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years as one of the other <UNK> pointed out this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines the puppets are fantastically cute the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard <UNK> paint and pure imagination they remind us of our own <UNK> when we could spend the day at our own <UNK> house exploring the world around us for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as <UNK> this show is for you you'll make up for lost time this show is a true inspiration and filled with <UNK> and humor and just outright fun for children and adults alike in other words don't overlook this show just because you're over the age of three spend a half hour with <UNK> <UNK> mr and russell they'll be friends you look forward to seeing
<START> we saw la at the international film video festival liked it br br this film <UNK> into the fear we all have fear of <UNK> fear of <UNK> and most importantly fear of our own <UNK> br br the three lead actors as <UNK> <UNK> as flavia <UNK> as <UNK> are match well to their roles and are excellent it was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real br br i believe is a stand out i hope we see much more of her in the coming years br br this film doesn't take the easy way out thumbs up to the italian team who put this film together highly recommended
<START> this film is truly <UNK> in all <UNK> script acting plot direction and editing are all uniformly awful i give it 1 out of 10 simply because people turned up to make it i would have given it 2 out of 10 if they had all stayed at home instead avoid at all costs
<START> you have to hand it to writer director john hughes with enormous success behind him in the <UNK> teenager high school vein he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian actor john candy here goof off adult candy becomes a better person after <UNK> to <UNK> his brother's kids it's a <UNK> formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences still hughes relies almost completely on <UNK> charm to put the scenario over and one may eventually grow tired of the <UNK> gags with the star front and center the kids are sitcom smart the other adults <UNK> <UNK> and amy <UNK> is too intense too hyped up playing uncle <UNK> girlfriend later became a tv series which is <UNK> since the material was already television <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> this film was great miller and <UNK> did a great job they both look good together and they both pulled it off <UNK> smith was so funny as the cousin and she couldn't stay out of her business essence held it down for her girl when she needed her was sweet and played a dear grandmother she really reminded me of my grandmother and oh i can't forget about the stripper he was so find and i didn't know if i should cover my eyes or smile while i watch him reveal his <UNK> on the big screen damn he was fine looked flawless and sexy and she stepped up a notch since <UNK> over all the movie had a lot a list actors and actress it was funny sexy crazy touching loving emotional and wonderful this movie is a must see go it get on dvd now if don't have it
<START> ok i will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie everybody knows of motion picture association of america's ratings g pg pg 13 r and <UNK> 17 for the purposes of this movie i think the should create a new rating standard iq 20
<START> bad sequels this one's a real one when the first movie was very very bad you have to be fool to make a sequel worse actors worse scenario worse special effects worse movie this is history bad history i give it 0 and a half for laughs out of
<START> 1983 was a <UNK> year for stephen king books making it to the big screen christine the dead zone and <UNK> were all released within a few months of each other while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch christine and <UNK> were both pretty bad and it's a close run thing as to which is the lesser of the two if pushed for an answer i'd say <UNK> <UNK> is the weakest br br donna <UNK> dee wallace fresh from success as <UNK> mom in e t the extra <UNK> is a mother whose marriage to husband <UNK> daniel hugh kelly is hanging by a thread she's been having an affair with a local worker and is now <UNK> on whether or not to leave her husband dragged into the marital <UNK> is young tad <UNK> danny son of donna and <UNK> and a pretty messed up kid with a <UNK> <UNK> of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks donna and tad take the family car to a nearby yard for <UNK> but as they arrive their car to a halt things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic joe ed <UNK> isn't there he has been <UNK> killed by his pet dog <UNK> a gigantic st bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a <UNK> bat soon the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims the weather is hot not a living soul knows they're there the car won't start and the dog seriously wants their blood br br <UNK> has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller but it never really <UNK> into gear i've read the book and it is quite disappointing certainly for king so it's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little on the <UNK> page king was at least able to generate a degree of tension but the film is <UNK> <UNK> by the fact that a st bernard simply isn't very scary the of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that <UNK> is a st bernard in the book it was possible to forget this in the book <UNK> sometimes almost seemed to assume the <UNK> of a monster even with the relatively short running time of an hour and a half <UNK> becomes a tedious and patience <UNK> experience occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be they've even <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> downbeat ending and replaced it with an <UNK> well that ends well conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood <UNK> this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation
<START> sorry but <UNK> hyde get it jack l and hyde <UNK> hyde has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn not to mention a script apparently written by a first <UNK> with learning <UNK> br br jackie hyde <UNK> an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had guess who yes an <UNK> of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind yes that mr hyde br br despite some nice skin scenes this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than <UNK> laughter br br as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from <UNK> special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time
<START> latter days is a very very independent movie and compared to many of today's more modern films it's lacking on many parts the shooting seems at times quite amateurish the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not <UNK> complex so don't have too high hopes for this movie because as i've said it's very independent but whatever it lacks in the <UNK> aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story's charm i cannot claim that the plot is <UNK> original but the story is still beautiful and heart warming in many ways it's not about being gay versus being straight it's about faith and how you decide to run your own life it's a silly story that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time so to be honest latter days is far from perfect but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it it's very critical towards the religious aspects of our society and there is homosexuality involved but approach it with an open mind and i'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself
<START> as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it's underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on <UNK> maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual <UNK> that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also <UNK> on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half <UNK> friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your teen sex comedy but it's so much more than that it's a very honest movie it's also very <UNK> which i love if you love the 80's or grew up in the 80's rent this movie but there may be some people that don't like the 80's but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it's very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it's an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of
<START> pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case it starts off <UNK> but kind of hits a wall at a certain point we're sure we know what happened then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red <UNK> pops back up and disappoints still <UNK> direction is great and the acting is quite good louis <UNK> who also co starred in marcel <UNK> <UNK> de gives the best performance as the clever detective i wonder if the <UNK> brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote <UNK> much like that film the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through and then he becomes almost the focus of the film there's also a lot of <UNK> comedy surrounding him although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist
<START> a time to kill is based on john <UNK> first novel the one he wrote before he was famous and the one that didn't <UNK> him to fame that would be accomplished by the firm that's why this movie didn't get made until much later after <UNK> was off <UNK> out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head unlike most of those this book was actually about something it had meat it had weight and it had heart br br but it also had a fatal flaw and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie namely a time to kill sets you up br br here we have a black man jackson on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10 year old daughter we have an underdog lawyer <UNK> battling the big bad system to save his client and oh by the way the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in <UNK> complete with <UNK> <UNK> men burning crosses br br in other words we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people <UNK> free carl lee br br but the racism issue is a <UNK> and the whole thing is contrived carl lee was a vigilante yes there were <UNK> circumstances for what he did but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent this would have been true no matter what his skin colour or the skin colour of the <UNK> of his daughter the judge the jury or anyone else br br and what's so heavy handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood br br this isn't the first time a heavy dose of <UNK> is inserted into a story like this and it won't be the last as a movie a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book and the acting isn't half bad but it played the hand it had been dealt really even a good cast can't elevate bad source material
<START> first of all just let me say this ghost story hello br br if any of the other people who <UNK> this movie from beginning to end realized this fact their reviews would have been very different the fact that characters kept disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back to look should have been a dead <UNK> this movie was not billed as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store not even a hint and that is the biggest mistake that was made by the studio who <UNK> it it was deliberate on their part not to market it as a ghost story in order to confuse you like the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it the problem in this is that they lost too many viewers the ghosts appeared too human and real without any of the usual <UNK> signs imagery or special effects that hollywood usually uses to let you know you are now seeing a ghost and that is what they were trying to do the main character does not know she is seeing ghosts and neither does the viewer now do you get it as long as you understand that the main character is seeing ghosts then you'll understand the movie and not be so irritated by what is perceived as major <UNK> in continuity or plot flaws br br i admit this being said it still was not a good movie just not as bad a just about everyone else made it out to be just understand if you plan on watching this movie everything you see ain't always what what you think it is 4 out of 10 for acting 3 for originality 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor though there was some gore and spooky moments still not a good movie just way misunderstood
<START> okay so i've read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by <UNK> to this site and the feeling i get is that most people who wrote reviews really didn't like this movie that's why i'm writing now i represent the minority because i did i admit i went to see the movie because i am very impressed with ryan compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible he is an amazing actor that aside i wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me why because it's a <UNK> where you know from the start and that's kind of unusual br br as the plot goes two teenage boys <UNK> to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly free the <UNK> and let's remember acting out of one's will the relationship between richard and justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by ryan <UNK> and michael pitt <UNK> was the <UNK> controlling smooth <UNK> and pitt was the extremely book smart socially awkward <UNK> enter sandra <UNK> character who it seems most people didn't particularly appreciate i think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a self <UNK> thing i didn't see that as the case here without <UNK> personal history about the ex husband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with richard <UNK> she never would have pursued her instincts about justin and richard the case was seemingly <UNK> against ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys even when the boys are <UNK> near the end of the movie neither <UNK> nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they <UNK> about knowing each other and the vomit justin left at the sight <UNK> lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the acting out of will as true freedom ' ended up working against justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers and to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as i have i looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and <UNK> there's also a song by <UNK> called murder by numbers but that's beside the point br br many readers <UNK> the necessity of the relationship between cassie and her partner but i think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about justin and richard yes it was a bit of the cliche women <UNK> woman acting out <UNK> in every <UNK> of her <UNK> plot but i think without the depth of <UNK> character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it there's no movie there br br and to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didn't commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can i remind you that the reason was because of the <UNK> placed and totally <UNK> shoe <UNK> the boys wanted to be involved it was a game they were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the <UNK> would have in <UNK> what they think is the truth what they didn't expect was that cassie <UNK> had an <UNK> case of instinct working on her side a little unbelievable maybe but many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts however this is a movie br br i saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and i liked it a little more the more i watched it the more i was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth richard <UNK> there are people really like this my main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had justin and <UNK> interactions a little more central because let's face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterization each character was very distinct and interesting in his her own way it was very well acted although i would have given ben <UNK> character a little more depth to work with he's a good actor and maybe <UNK> down <UNK> character a <UNK> br br i think everyone should keep in mind that for a hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the <UNK> at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end i think they did so quite well by <UNK> a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors ryan <UNK> and michael pitt i think if we remove our <UNK> cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real <UNK> and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed especially richard <UNK> not that i'm
<START> just how bad well compared to this movie cannibal holocaust is citizen kane there's the stilted acting the atrocious dialogue the half baked plot and like its companion piece way too much in the way of on screen animal slaughter that was actually done unlike holocaust <UNK> is a straight forward movie it doesn't pretend to be a pseudo documentary in some ways that helps the production in that the film is very sharp and crisp compared to <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately we are once again given a group of people who are morally <UNK> they torture the natives and essentially bring everything that they get upon themselves there's really nothing in this film that makes it worth your while i was fairly <UNK> with my review of holocaust due to some actual attempt at a statement and style but in case there is no reason to watch this unless you solely get off on blood and gore
<START> snap <UNK> pop the jarring sound of every change in camera angle and that's not to mention the white flashes and the <UNK> endings to almost every spoken sentence what on earth were they up to in the editing room or could it be that this approach was intentional surely not what purpose could it serve despite all its technical short <UNK> this is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of joe a hustler determined to earn 200 for his wife's pregnant girl friend joe is outstanding as the easy going passive laid back young man who is willing to let the other person do most of the talking while he <UNK> with a <UNK> look in his eyes br br the story is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the uncertain life led by a man who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and baby one thing is certain joe is <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> for sex or posing for an artist understandably so for he has a handsome face and and equally handsome body br br there is a scene in the film that is remarkably effective there is no sound no dialogue joe stark naked is <UNK> on the floor feeding <UNK> of cake to his little baby there is a beautiful <UNK> and <UNK> captured in these quiet moments br br another scene of amusing interest is the one in which joe desperately seeks a <UNK> of 100 from a gym friend coming to the point of asking in a very <UNK> approach br br joe tries to look interested but is <UNK> in his conversation when an artist gives him a non stop resume of greek and roman art it's a <UNK> to another occasion when joe himself of his clothes and poses as the <UNK> <UNK> in true classical style br br at the end of the film we gain the impression that we have got to know joe pretty well after all he has <UNK> more than his soul
<START> try to look for another movie that is such a trip without having a story or plot and you'll be hard pressed head is a masterpiece of non linear non structure <UNK> and in less than 90 minutes it manages to be not only a time capsule of an era but also a full length experimental feature that defies time space and convention in a way that only underground films of the sixties could head is a reflection of those films no matter how one feels about the <UNK> this is a film every filmmaker should see because it cracks wide open the endless possibilities of film as an art medium had it not been for the film's <UNK> ad campaign and the fact that by the time it came out the <UNK> so the media that the public had become weary of them and every critic was ready to <UNK> on them this could have had a much greater impact studying how the film was edited is much more important and exciting than what's actually in the film and yet there are some great things in it great songs great cinematography etc should be seen after midnight for maximum effect because of it's overall <UNK> feel 1968 was a time of social <UNK> and a call for change thus the film's working title changes and head perfectly mirrors that time
<START> have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camera work i'd say it's an okay horror flick ruined by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camera work watch <UNK> on the grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage the principal idea behind the film is rather an original one considering the abundance of killer doll based scare <UNK> which have been <UNK> upon us over the years unfortunately the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest michael bay <UNK> with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with <UNK> perfect by actors presumably from daytime korean soap operas it isn't scary and only succeeds in <UNK> your expectations of the next korean horror movie to come a calling oh well
<START> five fingers is so bad that i hardly know where to begin so let me admit first that i have only seen the first half hour when the first finger had been chopped off i thought sleeping a more useful activity i told my girlfriend the meaning of five fingers and she immediately followed my example br br couldn't the producer the director and or the scriptwriter <UNK> a chess amateur like me they should have used a digital chess clock and not an this major goof makes the mental pressure put on just a laugh how when and why did date a <UNK> girlfriend such an affair is very rare in the <UNK> br br calling me a <UNK> is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq moreover as far as i know <UNK> don't play chess i do br br the biggest problem is the script of course just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy to keep the <UNK> in a grip the information must be revealed bit by bit a nice twist now and then also helps i understood from other reviews that there is a big one at the end of the movie any smart person can guess what it is this of course just raises more questions why is the travel guide killed oh my why should i even care the whole movie focuses on just one thing the chopped fingers the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson it is thrilling to get a bomb <UNK> it is more thrilling to show that bomb <UNK> but no we don't see the paper cutter until the impossible <UNK> is over i will not waste more words on this crap go see hard candy
<START> according to the <UNK> on the back of the dvd case ross until a little bit of wee came <UNK> i suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it br br i never watched the series for one reason or another so maybe i'm missing some essential <UNK> as to this movie i watched the first 45 minutes or so i laughed once <UNK> once then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen nothing did br br evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post python gross humour style this one falls absolutely flat there's been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years not the least of which were 'the fast <UNK> 'the <UNK> of and <UNK> <UNK> each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches any one of these could knock this crap into a <UNK> hat br br if the series was anything like this movie i'm surprised they got the funding happily it was one of those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and is now in the local charity shop br br the moral of the story is don't believe the <UNK> never pay top dollar
<START> ever wonder where that episode <UNK> came from in the middle of the first season of m a s h well now the <UNK> out of the bag they got it from this soviet film a satire on how dumb the is due to the slip of a pen rendering the phrase the <UNK> though into lieutenant which has no meaning and nobody being honest or <UNK> enough to <UNK> him and just tell him the truth doesn't exist and never did so they make up an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him off and 40 years later david and bruce <UNK> borrowed this zany plot and gave us essentially the same story only on the other side of what had become the cold war proving that people in high positions can be equally dumb no matter what their <UNK> may be
<START> george <UNK> of the <UNK> fame he made both the haunting european original and the hollywood remake directed he shouldn't really be blamed for this confused poor movie because all the problems lie in brendan <UNK> script it's ill focused and <UNK> written for instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl cut to the next scene where she tells the villain i've told you everything about myself tell me about your life unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue i know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder br br it's difficult to explain the message of the film at some points it feels like it's trying to be a british natural born killers the <UNK> <UNK> with crime perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game <UNK> but the script isn't witty enough to carry this off when you've got a sex scene that doesn't progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know you've got a badly written screenplay and is a badly written screenplay
<START> although the plot of this film is a bit far fetched it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and the latter delivers a truly wonderful <UNK> accent caine <UNK> it up which is exactly what the character he is playing should do entertaining and fun this is a hour and a half of easy watching
<START> no idea how this is rated as high as it is 5 8 at the time of writing but this movie was absolutely horrible the acting wasn't entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor its obviously a b movie or a c if such a thing exists and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad i mean like the bad i don't know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort don't bother seriously just don't
<START> if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking <UNK> over at <UNK> way you know what to expect with this latest production all the familiar elements are in place the strong <UNK> between two characters usually a cop and a baddie the <UNK> and chances that turn on a dime and pay off <UNK> in the end and the humor that <UNK> even in the most dire of situations br br andy <UNK> plays a man who has <UNK> hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company <UNK> <UNK> wan also brilliant in other <UNK> way films like longest <UNK> a hero never dies and where a good man goes portrays a hostage <UNK> cop who is on the <UNK> tail even as the <UNK> sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man br br funny poignant and cool while being subtle running is actually one of the most entertaining <UNK> way films to date don't miss the performances by the two leads <UNK> andy <UNK> usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch this film is one to go out of your way to see
<START> a very disappointing film from oliver stone which unlike his recent epic j f k fails to <UNK> any sort of real emotion talk radio is about talk back host <UNK> a very loud <UNK> man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him his boss in the movie alec baldwin sums up his character very well by saying he's just a shoe salesman with a big mouth and as barry eric <UNK> gets death threat upon death threat the final outcome is almost inevitable br br this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say however talk radio fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating pointless film br br <UNK> september 17 1992 video
<START> stupid horror film about five 20 somethings 3 guys 2 girls going to this place in the middle of nowhere what they don't know is dr <UNK> and his female <UNK> attack and kill anybody who <UNK> in their woods they use their body parts for some experiments or something also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some <UNK> br br pretty desperate the story is confusing and boring the gore is laughably fake dr <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> terribly there's some dreadful black humor in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them br br this was pretty insulting there are a few <UNK> a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good chase <UNK> is great as reese butch <UNK> is ok as jimmy ashley mccarthy is also good as <UNK> and robert <UNK> has his moments as nicholas best of all is <UNK> crisp as jessica she was excellent some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well acted and interesting unfortunately the dialogue wasn't really there for them i'm giving it a 4 for their performances but nothing else here is worth mentioning hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them
<START> having loved stephen king's novels and short stories for many years i like most reviewers have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his <UNK> works a few notable exceptions are stand by me from the body carrie from the novel of the same name and the <UNK> redemption from rita and <UNK> redemption this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen king's name attached to it in any way it is no surprise that mr king has pretty much <UNK> any connection with it i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted cheaply filmed <UNK> directed piece of garbage is that they had the <UNK> to completely change the ending don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow wow of a movie
<START> the subject of this movie is disturbing how could some otherwise intelligent religious hard working and sincere white treat the native blacks so <UNK> for so long br br the movie answers this question and also explains how some are changing in a positive way
<START> if you want to see a great little horror comedy with an eerie feel to it this is the one if you are expecting a blood and guts gore flick thats going to scare your pants off then this isn't the one for you br br for the budget that this movie was filmed on the music was particularly amazing even though the film was filmed on a bargain budget the music and audio was definitely better than most movies with a huge budget br br the story was truly well done and the director is to be <UNK> there is an almost perfect blend of comedy to horror in this movie the acting is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel which i am definitely holding out for i have no doubt that this movie will become an instant cult classic br br in a nutshell this movie chronicles the life story of a boy who enters into the career of becoming a grave <UNK> it tells the story in flashback of each of the more fantastic experiences that the <UNK> duo encounters vampires to zombies and even aliens our stars start out as simple grave robbers stealing for <UNK> but quickly become body <UNK> for a mad doctor <UNK> who requires bodies for his medical <UNK> when the duo find a way to have a vampire <UNK> their cruel <UNK> the grave robbers discover that <UNK> in undead corpses is much more <UNK> than just stealing regular dead bodies the only problem is that there is another gang called the house of murphy that is competing for the same undead corpses and thats where both grave robbing gangs clash head to head with dire consequences br br this movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that i have seen in years and reminds me of the evil dead don't miss this one you will regret it
<START> the female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking they can also talk like there's no tomorrow otherwise this show would go into the toilet quickly how much money do they make on all the people who text in with that hope to be called back to win 100 <UNK> or whatever boy now that's a <UNK> can i buy <UNK> in this money maker let's face it with the technology of now thousands of people could be calling every minute and with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap on thousands of people watch this show oh i know this answer is probably a super common line among the <UNK> with these super <UNK> constantly saying the needs <UNK> i think it's a bunch of b s frequently someone who does get through sounds amazed that they're actually talking to the host many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get on and score some pocket change wow the producers must be just <UNK> it in no wonder there are so few commercials commercials are only on to give time for more primarily losers to text in and wait and hope and dream and <UNK> about what winning enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at <UNK> something i only watch it now then on my brothers tv because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer i'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at mel one of the looking women on tv and laugh at the <UNK> that's in front of me then i have to leave even if i don't people who have an active life can only take this show in extreme <UNK> mel get yourself into the movies or tv sitcoms or something many of us are <UNK> with you even with the super <UNK> ties i'm amazed this show is still on
<START> this film was amazing it was extremely funny and moving <UNK> <UNK> and jeffrey caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages james <UNK> and steven robertson made this film brilliant their acting was excellent there was this real <UNK> feeling between them that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out <UNK> <UNK> is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role the story of these two physically challenged people and their <UNK> is well put over and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on it was especially <UNK> at the end i would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have <UNK> you will need them br br again amazing film
<START> or should i say unintentionally hilarious either way this is one of the best comedies i've seen in a long time i was laughing throughout at the antics of some of the dumbest fictional characters this side of homer simpson it's just one <UNK> <UNK> painfully stupid scene after another as the <UNK> dim witted cardboard <UNK> <UNK> for actual <UNK> characters push pull and drag the plot to its inevitable and obvious conclusion br br if i had to describe this movie to someone i'd call it a mutated hybrid of fatal attraction dumb and dumber and the three stooges with a climax <UNK> similar to the episode of family guy in which the whole family gets into a knock down <UNK> in the living room br br advice to benson family next time you get a new pet do the poor animal a favor and don't name it fred
<START> sorry i couldn't be more <UNK> in my summary but those two words seemed to describe the movie perfectly this is not only a bad film but a bad film with bad acting and a plot that will be <UNK> to most <UNK> br br see it only for a naked rebecca de tied to a chain link fence and <UNK> with supposedly but actually hilarious br br
<START> starting where the last left off an alien <UNK> emerges from a dead predator on a predator spaceship and causes the predator space ship to crash into modern day <UNK> where it <UNK> several more aliens which start to cause havoc the predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed predator to clean up the mess our human characters are caught in the middle of the <UNK> battle br br the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing this movie moves along way too fast the opening credits have only just rolled and already the predator ship crashes into the earth after the alien grows to full <UNK> a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed then we see the predator home world and the lead predator flies off to fight the alien <UNK> and all this happens within the first five minutes this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name random <UNK> a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names one moment our main characters are at home the next running around town the next in a gun store the next in an and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them <UNK> for <UNK> br br another problem is the settings and time frame the movie is set in modern day <UNK> every other alien and predator movie was shot in enthralling settings such as industrial space ships <UNK> war zone alien planets and underground <UNK> now comes along r set in a small modern day american town with set highlights including a sporting goods store parking lots pizza <UNK> and little girl's <UNK> i mean were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull drab and uninteresting as possible it's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of or hiding in the <UNK> outside little girls <UNK> br br continuity is a big issue with this film the alien series was set in the future no human had even heard of an alien before the first film and the aliens not only had never been to earth but if they ever did reach earth humanity would be destroyed this movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day with average <UNK> seeing the aliens all over the place and by the end of the movie humanity is not destroyed not even suffering what could be considered minor <UNK> it <UNK> all over that entire concept of the other movies attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive <UNK> ex the predator just happens to carry around a bottle of <UNK> magic blue <UNK> that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly <UNK> <UNK> and drop a nuclear <UNK> that just conveniently <UNK> all evidence of the aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes br br also for a <UNK> movie it has <UNK> bias in favor of the <UNK> for the majority of the film a lone predator manages to kill dozens if not <UNK> of dozens of aliens all at <UNK> range while barely gaining a single scratch while the aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay <UNK> merely waiting their turn to be killed by the predator without putting forth any effort to defend their <UNK> this movie should not be called alien vs predator as much as it should be predator <UNK> aliens i mean how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other br br the characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous alien and predator movies but even as a stand alone movie they are bland dreary and even at times cringe worthy the characters in this movie consist of i kid you not horny couples wanting to get laid pizza delivery boys blonde <UNK> high school bullies children and a blatant copy and <UNK> job ripping off <UNK> and <UNK> the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters not only that but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers while the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical <UNK> slasher porn movie with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering <UNK> dialog not only this but these characters do some of the most <UNK> retarded things ever such as using predator guns commenting the powers out when it has been for hours following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly and just so many other <UNK> that the movie actually had the audience in my theater <UNK> out of frustration br br in the end this movie is just a horrible b movie something deserving of the direct to dvd category the fact this movie was a theatrical release me as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work
<START> michael caine usually appears in either very good blame it on <UNK> sleuth without a clue <UNK> dirty rotten <UNK> or truly bad comedies noises off death becomes her harry walter go to ny this falls into the latter category br br <UNK> is a comedy that succeeds in only two things managing to waste a cast that includes caine and richardson all of which have comedic abilities and <UNK> in its mission not to make the viewer laugh there isn't a single truly funny moment here the main reason is the lousy script there was so much <UNK> effort put into writing a <UNK> convoluted story which is simply too <UNK> to follow considering it's only a comedy that the writer s forgot to make the damn thing funny which as far as i can recall is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be br br i've never seen this moron before some people even say if you're a moron fan you'll love this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a moron fan does this non <UNK> person really have fans a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega talent to <UNK> out a laugh or two out of it someone like steve <UNK> and not your average moron br br if you're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are the characters of caine and moron are <UNK> dumb br br the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a super intelligent wise ass kid smart a kids aren't even funny to bill <UNK> fans any more in little miss sunshine we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny this stupid ol' the kid is smarter than the adults <UNK> belongs to a century old marx brothers film
<START> alas another <UNK> movie that was an hour too long credible performances but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there first we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story will the script center on randall and his wife randall and <UNK> how about <UNK> and thomas in the end no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are <UNK> <UNK> up by monologues from third parties the singer explains randall randall explains <UNK> on and on finally long after you don't care anymore you will learn something about the script <UNK> three endings were no doubt <UNK> and no one could make a decision the end result all three were used one after another after another if you can hang in past the <UNK> yawn you'll be able to pick them out despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the coast guard this one should have washed out the very first day
<START> oh my god obviously when you rent or buy this you're not expecting to see a documentary on the <UNK> <UNK> of small <UNK> in their natural <UNK> you're expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two well for those who are as sick and twisted as myself you won't find many scares but you'll come very close to <UNK> all over yourself in laughter the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever the first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago but still we laugh our <UNK> off and use the catch phrases it's as <UNK> and funny as sam <UNK> the evil dead ii dead by dawn and peter jackson's dead alive <UNK> from the opening <UNK> absolutely ridiculous dialog to the splatter and gore <UNK> finest works to the wondrous abilities of ed the film cutter you will laugh and laugh again as far as the visual feast of blood and gore oh yeah they've got it and they're pretty damn good at it the neck <UNK> connected to the head bone this film also may have done the best nightmare <UNK> totally <UNK> nuts scene i have ever seen and that one's not mean to be funny but man is it well done and creepy overall to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time if you ever see this movie get it it's on netflix i know that for sure
<START> had the pleasure to see this film at the big bear film festival where it won the audience award and i have to say it was well deserved because boy next door is a very funny short film the script is well written and keeps things <UNK> it also has a great current of suspense <UNK> through it you don't know what's going to happen next as the main character tries to deal with the realization that his new neighbor might not be the most ideal person to be living across from him the jokes are quick and unexpected the plot keeps us guessing the dialog feels very real i thought the direction was first rate and the director travis davis shows a lot of potential for making it big in the world of studio comedies not small praise considering he also is the lead actor of the film so he had to do triple duty on this writing directing and starring if you get a chance to see this film on <UNK> it's worth the <UNK> it'll make you laugh out loud a few times and that's more than most shorts offer these days
<START> this morning i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed i found myself thinking oh yeah there was a mr <UNK> movie wasn't there this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie <UNK> group for the visually <UNK> said that this movie was <UNK> i even went to see this movie on the day it opened because i am a fan of both mr <UNK> and mr <UNK> and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr <UNK> i even remember the opening animated credits because i thought that they were pretty amusing br br after that though its all a complete blank i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame so bland and so utterly without merit that you can't remember anything from it i understand that leslie <UNK> isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies but i saw him in spy hard in scary movie 4 and police squad 3 and none of these were great movies but i came away at least remembering something mr <UNK> though is a complete blank br br i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it in the hopes of <UNK> at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie
<START> this might not have been as horribly bad as it was if not for the absolutely awful acting job done by raymond wallace this guy is so bad it wasn't even funny his character was needed in the film but why they chose this guy is beyond me br br if you're looking for some quality chinese films might i suggest raise the red <UNK> the story of <UNK> red <UNK> br br anything but this i was surprised at how many people actually rated this highly really the acting by this wallace loser is so bad it <UNK> the other good parts of this film this was agreed upon by all 6 of us watching this movie last night br br stay clear of this piece of garbage
<START> you know i'm sure the boys were sitting around the office one day and said how can we make more money they had made every possible <UNK> of toy they could make with their current characters so they decide let's steal the star wars idea a prequel and we can make up all new characters and sell them as toys something they did in puppet master 3 but who cares anyway they pick a point in time before the first movie when <UNK> is still alive he and the puppets are sitting around and a wooden head roll on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a dead family member or something it doesn't matter so the tale of the puppet master <UNK> begins it's long it's boring no body cares br br the funniest part is they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie but give no clues of their fate so guess what once the <UNK> from the new toys pays off they can new and 4th straight rotten sequel called puppet master 8 the sequel to the prequel of the fate of the dead retro puppets hold your breath
<START> this movie is so good i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im 15 now plus the acting was great and madonna is my idol and she did a <UNK> job alot of people didnt like this movie and i still to this day dont understand why
<START> this film makes several <UNK> to various science fiction films the prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of <UNK> <UNK> the trailer for buck rogers here it was clips from some early japanese sf tv show then the opening shot of the city in has the dragon <UNK> flying <UNK> with a <UNK> reminding one immediately of <UNK> the <UNK> aspect comes even br br more <UNK> when we meet the hero who is called a <UNK> he is blond haired and is called <UNK> a homage to roy <UNK> <UNK> character in <UNK> a battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of the matrix the government forcing the population to take drugs is like <UNK> <UNK> and the chief <UNK> while looks like a cross between elvis and dan <UNK> turns out to be a robot very much like the terminator the end battle reminds one of terminator 2 and the end result is hilarious probably not one of the best sf films out there but is enjoyable certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like battlefield earth
<START> the only reason i'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater 3000 the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him dick <UNK> was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil he was more annoying then anything peter graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co stars lack of talent in 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the island i personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie if you want to laugh at this movie get the mst3k episode its really funny full of <UNK> and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable
<START> but at the same time part of you is thinking am i ready for what i am about to see br br in the end you are happy you saw it i was at least jackass number two has twice the laughs and twice the action some stunts will leave you breathless besides little miss sunshine i think it was the best movie i saw this summer maybe even this year br br the entire cast returns besides a few such as chris and <UNK> i don't think any of the cast members had a dull moment each and every stunt was either funny or dangerous or a combination of both stupid the beginning was just as funny as the first one and the ending was interestingly hilarious the cast performing a musical number br br jackass number two is the perfect movie to see with your friends stay during the credits there are some pretty funny moments one involves luke wilson
<START> this movie is hilarious i would say much more painful disgusting than the previous movie the entire cast from the previous movie series is present br br these kind of movies are great to watch in the cause the whole audience is crying with laughter especially at the terrorist part that was damn disgusting i wish they made more of these kind of movies br br strong stomach required they got some insane stunts this time around warning includes a lot of snakes i would love to write about it but i just can't spoil the fun go see it
<START> any film school student could made a film 1 000 times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight re telling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond narrative and make a great film br br well the director did go beyond narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named that was not in the book he had bob <UNK> interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the <UNK> the film had all the insight of someone stoned on <UNK> staring at his <UNK> br br if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made
<START> the best romantic comedy i've seen in years not the kind of slick over the top hollywood stuff by ben stiller or adam sandler and a lot less <UNK> than a hugh grant epic <UNK> nicholson and jay <UNK> are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time their sexual <UNK> before marriage instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director <UNK> a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action nicholson is just great as the awkward <UNK> and <UNK> does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his <UNK> a little too much we see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story andy <UNK> earnest friend and helen slater <UNK> single mom are particularly good there is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy girl farce indeed with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy
<START> the man who gave us <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> gave us this incoherent <UNK> of cliched characters poor plotting you've got to be kidding dialogue and melodramatic acting i guess everybody has a bad day at the office now and then he's allowed
<START> i've seen this story before but my kids haven't boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin <UNK> an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled <UNK> is played by <UNK> while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> well i never really understood ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted <UNK> to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to <UNK> the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons
<START> a truly accurate and <UNK> look into modern day life it could be set in any town in the uk br br i live in a <UNK> estate in <UNK> and can relate to this film very well br br sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable br br the actors are <UNK> believable i felt as if i was <UNK> on my <UNK> it was an intimate <UNK> into the lives of fragile and hopeless people i was very moved by a few scenes br br i loved the way this film was shot br br overall this film is a must see
<START> but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production the only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy why did i hate van so much well throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third rate <UNK> sales imitation with lots of <UNK> bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh the worst of these moments was when he was teaching the class these kids laughed at everything he did heck van could have read the phone book or showed them <UNK> photos and they probably would have laughed now van was not the only bad casting decision in the film he was just the most obvious of course having john gielgud a lovely actor play an asian was ridiculous as well as having michael york play peter <UNK> brother the bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices the film was doomed from the start and the worst of them was the god awful bobby van now in real life he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young but with the material they gave him here i just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet br br now i also mentioned the songs those terrible songs the original lost horizon by frank <UNK> was a subtle delight throughout and not a single song and dance number in the film so why did they decide to add a <UNK> songs that did nothing to help the film they only served to make it seem like a <UNK> mess like the original doctor <UNK> combined with lost horizon the end result is a <UNK> sweet children's movie not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8 br br now if you can remove these problems you have the basis of a decent film after all the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo peter <UNK> is particularly good though certainly not the equal of ronald colman in the original but considering that the original was a near perfect classic why bother with this <UNK> <UNK> who wants to <UNK> through the <UNK> br br by the way this film was included in the 50 worst films book by harry <UNK> while i too disliked the film it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book i think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared an excellent book just not one of the best <UNK> to the <UNK> hall of dreck
<START> as a non <UNK> im not going to comment on the great mans theory which changed the world 150 years ago safe to say science is based on evidence religion is based on blind faith <UNK> said there then br br the film was produced by the bbc and to be honest it could quite easily have been shown on television while the acting is superb the film itself isn't really worthy of a full blown cinema release that said if it reaches a wider audience this way then so be it but i have seen many period style dramas on bbc tv and they were well up to the finished standard of this just don't expect too much of a big budget thrill ride when going to see it br br in some ways i found the movie almost going out on a <UNK> to <UNK> to religious <UNK> while it <UNK> a good sense of tension the whole way through i couldn't help wanting it to get to the <UNK> of the origin of species much <UNK> than it actually did you'll wait right until the end for that and it seemed to <UNK> much more than i was ever aware on <UNK> struggle with himself and his wife emma portraying him almost as some kind of insane lunatic at times which is hardly true there are many other errors and facts missing in relation to the real story of the lead up to the <UNK> of origin too but the whole premise of the movie focuses almost entirely on the difficulty <UNK> faced <UNK> with the book and a small portion on the death of his beloved daughter annie this gives the film its most moving scene where annie passes away as she asks one final time to hear <UNK> tell her the story of a captive <UNK> which died of <UNK> though you'll probably feel a bigger connection with the <UNK> in that scene than with <UNK> daughter br br with the early controversy apparently surrounding the movie in the usa it will work well to promote it and ensure many more people will get to see it but to be honest there is actually very little in it that insults any mythical its hardly <UNK> news about a theory that has been around 150 years after all but as fundamental christians and many other <UNK> which we're all well aware of like to wave a <UNK> or two whenever possible i guess this movie is as good excuse as any personally i cant see what all the fuss is about but maybe they're just around
<START> this is the most human and <UNK> of movies that i have seen in a long time the <UNK> abound susan sarandon as a nun tim robbins and susan sarandon in a movie that doesn't <UNK> but neither does it <UNK> it is cinema <UNK> at it's best and yet the story is <UNK> from several real events br br which of the two is more amazing sarandon or penn it is easy to say who is more likeable but it is hard to say who is more convincing they are simply magnificent br br you may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without <UNK> is no life and that death is more <UNK> whatever your personal feeling this movie gives you a chance to pause and <UNK> br br at the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect that is what great drama does it gives <UNK> it creates a moment in time a shared memory that touches our humanity
<START> i just finished watching this last weekend and found it absolutely <UNK> some of the scenes i just couldn't stop laughing at dennis is <UNK> amazingly thick sometimes and just says the things but at the same time he's just being cool to impress his girlfriend who gets arrested anyway the beach scenery is very <UNK> until along comes <UNK> <UNK> not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a saturday night when you haven't got much else to do like i did you might need to hunt around for it though i was lucky as my local video store <UNK> it
<START> out of 15 people i <UNK> this movie too no one finished it it was so awfully not good just awful she sits in a chair the whole movie she's in a closet the chair she's sitting is nice i can't think of anything more to say but 10 lines of text to print this up my friend nick thinks this is a great movie because he can give it to his friends and not have to worry about those calling him back he's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years which is how i got it then i tried to get my friends to finish this awful awful piece of crap to no no one could finish it takes boredom to a whole new level they could use this in iraq instead of water <UNK> please send copies <UNK> bay cuba makes great <UNK> gift
<START> i watched a made for television film about the destruction at <UNK> texas it was obviously heavily <UNK> toward the claim that david was a murderous child <UNK> cult leader hell bent on killing as many cops as he wanted and taking his people to the heavens on a blood <UNK> <UNK> br br the film was little more than propaganda further <UNK> what we had already read in the <UNK> i am more and more sure of that since i watched the great documentary <UNK> the rules of not that every <UNK> made in this film should be taken as god's truth but it tells the whole story rather than <UNK> only what law <UNK> decided to tell br br for those who have forgot was the spiritual leader of the religious movement named the branch <UNK> charges of drug use kidnapping illegal weapon <UNK> and <UNK> rape among others i'm sure raised the <UNK> of the local police then later federal law <UNK> while attempting to serve a search warrant the <UNK> of alcohol <UNK> and <UNK> and the clan <UNK> in a shoot out that left deceased and wounded on both sides br br it was then that the federal <UNK> of investigation fbi got involved <UNK> between the two were spirited but eventually broke down the fbi prepared for an invasion by <UNK> the building with flash bang <UNK> and gas when the building burnt to the ground killing many within including the fbi refused to admit responsibility saying the cult inside must have set it on fire themselves this images of jim jones and other violent religious <UNK> br br the picture puts on many masks to tell its story it begins with a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the truth as far as the record is concerned anyway what is eye opening is how <UNK> the politicians remained even in a difficult and serious situation as this the <UNK> were concerned in nothing more than defending every single action taken by law <UNK> it was the <UNK> that seemed open to the other side br br it is impossible to relate all of the new information and analysis provided by this documentary additionally a list would take away from the film opening up as it goes along one example would be the heart breaking fact that children died within the compound the filmmakers probably side more with the <UNK> in general but stay relatively open to either side in this instance the <UNK> seem at fault for <UNK> a situation that involves innocent children but on the other hand the parents also need to shoulder some of the blame for leaving their kids in this <UNK> situation when they could have released them to any number of local authorities br br probably the most <UNK> new information comes late in the film and involves the <UNK> claim they did not fire upon the building this is left up to interpretation and i will not reveal any more than to say it is disturbing and shocking what can and cannot be told br br the federal officers are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than the largest <UNK> seems to be <UNK> on the media unwilling to tell both sides of a story this element seems prevalent in recent documentaries <UNK> so i believe it is time for the media to return to telling news stories and leave this relentless pursuit of what will draw the biggest audience and ratings br br it is hard to mess up a documentary in most cases switching on a camera and editing together interesting pieces of life is common and tells a terrific story what few can do is shed such new light on a subject that the way you think about it is forever altered <UNK> is that kind of film 5 out of
<START> let me start off by saying that i loved the original grudge it was bar none one of the scariest most hair rising experiences i've ever had in a filled movie theatre i'm not kidding being a self <UNK> also made the flick look better in my eyes if the setting had been changed to some american <UNK> i probably would've ended up hating the film br br that said this movie is a complete mess i won't say it sucks because a the movie does have some good points b it sucks is the <UNK> put down in the history of lame put downs so what does the movie have going for it well for starters it has a pretty cool look through <UNK> and the use of bleak washed out colours takashi <UNK> almost <UNK> the downbeat angst ridden atmosphere of the original a few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable unfortunately the rest of the film is just plain bad period br br the story is all over the place needlessly told tarantino style i e the scenes are out of <UNK> order this technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing frankly a straightforward plot would've worked better the original was also lacking plot wise but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time br br let's not forget the tv show acting skills which make the cast of the original grudge look like emily watson and <UNK> hepburn simply put the movie doesn't work it's too slow too dull and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot which adds nothing new to the story by the way so not even grudge fans will be pleased br br oh and what is it with the old man playing japanese <UNK> a boo on the bus is this supposed to be comic relief artistic statement or what
<START> before you watch this movie clean your ears take away the make up from your eyes and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you she doesn't have to this picture will give you both warmth enough to keep your relationship life long enough if you're jew russian <UNK> immigrant yes what popular movie minority so ever laugh within your memories if you're something else or whatever your are anyway laugh for the bittersweet memory of importance of friendship and family it this movie nothing will seem strange how ever strange it may seem still i'm afraid that few will see this movie because it's not the type of picture people watch when they go to movies but please do it for the humanity and don't forget to get the soundtrack for pleasure
<START> contains spoilers br br people who put a lonely <UNK> ad in the newspaper are often <UNK> they try to put into a few words everything they are and expect the exchange of letters is full of hope louis jean paul <UNK> owner of a cigarette company on the de la reunion east of <UNK> is so affected by the letters of julie that he <UNK> to her but not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the <UNK> but catherine <UNK> and we know from the start that she is a marriage <UNK> and that a crime has taken place she shows no interest in <UNK> wardrobe she does not even get her <UNK> open and <UNK> her <UNK> until it dies but the most basic tricks of seduction an open <UNK> are sufficient to <UNK> louis into a <UNK> little dog first a joint bank account and then when <UNK> sister draws attention to herself the flight with 27 <UNK> millions of <UNK> 28 millions she would have needed his signature for the entire sum br br louis and <UNK> sister engage a private detective michel <UNK> louis <UNK> to trace marion <UNK> real name in where she works as taxi girl her gangster lover left her <UNK> or rather louis finds himself unable to kill her she tells her story orphan <UNK> lesbian experiences many jail and soon she leads him by the nose again the detective turns out to be sly as a fox and <UNK> as a blood <UNK> louis and marion bury his body in the <UNK> they flee to paris where louis discovers that marion has a <UNK> taste she <UNK> money like a <UNK> he sells his firm at a <UNK> of its value but when the corpse of the detective is discovered a <UNK> they have to flee again without the money life in a mountain <UNK> together with a whining loser marion can think of a more cheerful life without this <UNK> br br a high point in the careers of everybody involved <UNK> self <UNK> makes him nearly endearing <UNK> looks beautiful in her wardrobe by <UNK> st <UNK> and her performance is delightful at first she <UNK> the fragile too <UNK> to ask her husband for money that's why the joint bank account is needed but after being exposed she sounds like <UNK> hepburn in the jail scene of bringing up baby the scenery is spectacular the <UNK> the <UNK> paris <UNK> directs with self evident <UNK> the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions after this film <UNK> was able to look his idol alfred full in the face
<START> pretty stereotyped good looking cast the story <UNK> in a wide and confusing arc leading you down a number of garden paths without attendant <UNK> before <UNK> to an end that feels you leaving hollow br br if you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying <UNK> this is going to be a disappointment <UNK> of the main character's overt sexuality i felt that he was <UNK> lacking a clear male persona rather like his lacking of a clear french persona even though he is laid naked or rather sat naked at the end of the film the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations that little thing called plot probably a <UNK> english speaking point of view at least if you take the side of the film
<START> after a very disappointing part 3 i kinda wondered if i should even bother with the next karate kid while i could see why this saga wouldn't continue i still enjoyed the next karate kid most out of the second and the third karate kid movies while there are some very unrealistic moments and situations it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one br br <UNK> <UNK> has this girl come far or what she plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when sort of <UNK> her per say he notices that she has karate skills he offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first karate kid but i would recommend this one i think you'll be pleasantly surprised br br 7 10
<START> this is without a doubt the stupidest movie of all time br br i don't know who i'm <UNK> at the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap br br i can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna be movie br br all of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot and the acting is the worst i have ever seen in any movie ever br br there is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person in fact i don't think they even had a script they just made up everything as they went along and you can tell br br the women i e men dressed up in drag trying to look like women in the costumes looked so ridiculous i guess they were trying to be sexy but not so much especially that old woman disgusting br br there is nothing scary about this movie the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it br br no brain required for watching this you must be a total loser to want to see this movie br br don't forget i warned you
<START> i liked this probably slightly more than terror by night though not enough to give it the extra the beginning is just brilliant as we <UNK> in on nazi agents scheming to get their hands on a new bomb sight and its <UNK> in a small swiss village only to be <UNK> by a disguised holmes who spirits the scientist back to london once there he does everything he can to keep the scientist from falling into the hands of the man behind it all not hitler but worse <UNK> arch enemy <UNK> of course the scientist disappears leaving a <UNK> <UNK> note and holmes goes in pursuit once again in disguise a climax in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is suitably exciting and we can all guess that all ends well can't we slightly over the top patriotic message as the credits roll now that i think of it the fine sense of place despite the obvious sets <UNK> use of disguise and the way in which so much plot is <UNK> into just over an hour what the heck it gets that extra and is my favorite of the 5 <UNK> bruce films i've seen to date br br watched on dvd part of the 50 mystery classics set from mill creek entertainment many of the <UNK> on these el <UNK> box sets are of very poor quality but holmes fans take note that the <UNK> bruce films there are 4 on this set are all quite watchable and reasonably sharp
<START> even though i have great interest in biblical movies i was bored to death every minute of the movie everything is bad the movie is too long the acting is most of the time a joke and the script is horrible i did not get the point in mixing the story about abraham and <UNK> together so if you value your time and sanity stay away from this horror
<START> i read comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture br br i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised br br to address comments br br trail street is a very well done western br br and randolph scott was in it quite a bit br br <UNK> hayes was funnier than i've ever seen him br br the bad guys had very good as far as i was concerned br br plus br br it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight laced good guy he's usually so slimy br br in all a good western very well acted and written br br i liked the background story of kansas and the winter <UNK> that supposedly helped it become a state too br br i thought the girl who played susan was lovely can't think why she didn't become a bigger star
<START> dire dismal awful laughable disappointing br br right your trapped in the cave with several hard men and a woman or two your being <UNK> killed by something and you still don't get to hear any naughty grown up words a 15 here in england and you could tell br br the <UNK> of the macho men was just too much pass the bucket i'm going to be sick br br this movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically be kept in the darkest deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever i have a feeling that this description isn't the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground br br just like the film the cube it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by well its self br br this comment contains spoilers alright its called the cave br br thanks bruce
<START> having watched the show for about four weeks which is enough to get a feel for the show i think it shows potential whilst much is borrowed from other shows what sci fi doesn't these days and the characters are stereotyped i like what they are doing with the stories there is some continuity with plot development and character interaction relationship building despite the essentially <UNK> nature of each episode there have been some science related topics explored as well as character secret weakness revelations these have also added some comedy to the show something i would gladly see more of in serious sci fi in all this makes for good balance such that can appeal to larger groups of people unlike the star trek vs <UNK> 5 <UNK> i've been numerous <UNK> and witness to the visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well budgeted for a first season the acting is acceptable and i am curious to see how well the actors manage to grow their characters out of their scripted stereotypes i see enough <UNK> and potential to remain interested in seeing where the show wants to go
<START> i think this movie actually has a lot of nice things to say about a lot of people johnny carson ted and it shows that <UNK> and leno actually liked and respected each other a lot treat williams as the half kung fu master half godfather like mike is terrific
<START> when i watched this crap it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire which is where this garbage belongs in a fire i don't even know what to say the acting blew the fire looked really fake andy the chicks exactly <UNK> and lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2 and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd fire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all i'm missing is the awesome <UNK> movie which i hear sucks balls br br well until my next crap movie peace
<START> <UNK> greatest period started in post war europe with <UNK> neo <UNK> movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed <UNK> new <UNK> caught everyone's attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate <UNK> island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 <UNK> visconti brought the art form to full circle <UNK> speaking with his <UNK> work death in <UNK> which might as well be called the death of cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie <UNK> coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like a grand <UNK> up not just of <UNK> particular <UNK> but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no <UNK> task master than the visconti revealed here he's not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is a challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br we will probably never be in such <UNK> company again in terms of the movies one of the <UNK> great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> almost <UNK> in the background <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> taking full advantage of ability to inspire <UNK> in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character into a <UNK> composer from his original persona as a writer even making <UNK> up to look like geeky mustache <UNK> shaggy hair duck like walk <UNK> by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies it's a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver <UNK> of meaning in a gesture or a glance a difficult trick without <UNK> like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse br br cinema just doesn't get better than this i'll ignore the complaints from the <UNK> <UNK> out there who say that it's too slow but even the more legitimate <UNK> concerning some of flashbacks with that <UNK> friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's <UNK> concerns i e which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the <UNK> and of these <UNK> serve to prevent <UNK> among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway a <UNK> stream of and beautiful dying <UNK> would be nothing more than a pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what it's mostly about is suffering romantic capital r suffering in particular as a suffering romantic himself visconti knew he spoke br br spoiler i guess if for nothing else see death in <UNK> for its <UNK> opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with jet black hair <UNK> dripping off of his <UNK> dying head and onto his <UNK> white face meanwhile off in the distance young the object of dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a <UNK> <UNK> the climatic sequence sums up with <UNK> economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in <UNK> is a <UNK> work of art br br dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie it's ostensibly in english but the dvd's sound seems <UNK> and there's a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway br br
<START> recycled and predictable plot the characters are as memorable as the story line we came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old overall a disappointment
<START> i must admit this is one of cameron <UNK> <UNK> of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead i was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters br br both <UNK> belle and <UNK> <UNK> were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist <UNK> and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters in real life this is one of those movies cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing she looked the part of the gorgeous rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause br br coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister faith little girl <UNK> is understandably very upset when faith leaves for europe as she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets <UNK> by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister's boyfriend br br great story and equally great location shooting around european i will watch it again
<START> i liked the first the grudge it really <UNK> me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice that something was missing from this sequel there was no creativity nothing new or original nothing that really sticks to your mind it's people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo and most of the time it wasn't even all that scary br br plot wise this movie is a dead end <UNK> <UNK> is a good actress but she was given nothing to do and <UNK> death seemed really <UNK> because it came so quickly i was also disappointed in the mother subplot i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge but she dies in the hands hair of that was such a stupid twist all in all it's difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die all in the same way and there's nothing they can do it doesn't feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them it's just boring because you know what's going to happen if they had anything to fight it with that would have added suspense even if they failed if there was any hope it would make the scares more justified now you're just waiting for them to die br br was really scary in the first movie but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it i was still scared during some scenes but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts yes i was scared at the school psychologist scene even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said i've been to the house a nice touch <UNK> however was not scary at all in this movie i was much more <UNK> out by the non blue <UNK> with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me br br some of the characters seemed really unnecessary the notorious milk scene with the girl whose name i can't even remember comes to mind i wasn't scared it was just huh i'm not sure if the <UNK> were even really needed karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her it could have killed people related to her life everyone at the funeral or something like that even so it would have been dull to watch them all die but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying hated the i won't call you mother scene <UNK> mother issues were equally dull the little boy was a touching character though br br the <UNK> on sequel was much scarier than this one it had some new twists dreams and reality <UNK> much more for instance and even if it left me feeling quite down i was also somehow satisfied i got to think a bit and be left wondering this movie only provided cheap scares
<START> i just caught wild rebels on one of the mystery science theatre 3000 archive <UNK> and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn't make it entertaining there are some mst3k targets that were films whose concepts were so <UNK> they couldn't possibly have been good movies like the green <UNK> and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn't them in the execution wild rebels is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier when don <UNK> directed his remake of the killers at universal both films are about a failed racing driver who's <UNK> by a femme fatale into driving the <UNK> car in a robbery <UNK> by the woman's boyfriend only in the killers the driver was john cassavetes the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was ronald reagan steve <UNK> <UNK> and willie are quite a <UNK> but what really makes wild rebels an awful movie is the direction by william note the accent over the final e present in his on screen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point it's only a pity that someone didn't do a mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between steve <UNK> and rod would have been irresistible
<START> i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book i don't think any of them have actually read it edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to <UNK> vision maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story so if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a <UNK> bunny view of wild animals maybe a good cry see the movie i hope john carter of mars <UNK> more respect than tarzan has we miss ya edgar
<START> let me get this straight the church has a safety lock down <UNK> to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground maybe i'm missing the plot maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of film making or something this movie is about as useless as the church itself hey maybe that's the point that whole rosemary's baby <UNK> segment was hilarity i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that the entire film needs to be remade properly there were so many things that were played down so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling i'm not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating
<START> are you in the house alone belongs to the pre cable tv days when the networks were eager to offer an alternative to popular tv shows it is well made thriller with a talented cast and credible situations kathleen plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters everyone seems to think that it is nothing more than a prank but is really scared tony bill and <UNK> <UNK> play parents ellen travolta john's sister is the high school principal and dennis quaid has one of his earliest roles as a cocky rich kid it's a competent <UNK> with a still relevant social message is lovely if you are 30 or older you will remember that she was very popular among youngsters <UNK> <UNK> who i usually don't like gives a truly moving performance nice little film
<START> this is a surprisingly great low budget horror comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending all the characters are pretty cool and the story while unoriginal is very good plus eric adam and justin <UNK> <UNK> had fantastic chemistry together one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when adam is trapped in the bathroom and <UNK> wakes up to find that monster truck sitting there and decides to take a p ss in the truck and <UNK> brooks is just plain sexy plus this is one of the best low budget horror films i have seen in a long time it's very gory but in a comical way and i thought it was very well written as well plus michael <UNK> smith is fantastic as the monster man and had some wicked makeup it's similar to films like joy ride duel <UNK> <UNK> etc etc and it has some suspenseful moments here and there plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part this is a surprisingly great low budget horror comedy it's funny and pretty well made with good performances and a really cool twist ending i highly recommend this one the direction is very good michael davis does a very good job here with great camera work good angles good use of colors and using a great setting plus he kept the film funny and at a very fast pace br br there is a lot of gore we get extremely bloody nose <UNK> gory bloody <UNK> guy is cut in half by a monster truck human remains in a <UNK> <UNK> guts all over the place guys guts fall out <UNK> in the eyes bloody <UNK> throat bunch of people walking around without limbs gory dead <UNK> heads are <UNK> severed limbs bloody and <UNK> corpses decent amount of bloodshed one very gory scene at the very end and more br br the acting is very good for a low budget film eric is fantastic here as adam he was a nerd but a very likable one he had fantastic chemistry with justin <UNK> had some cool lines and i just loved his character he also seemed to be enjoying himself and he was especially good at the end justin <UNK> is excellent as the ass of a best friend however i just couldn't help but love him as he was very funny and often stole a lot of the scenes i really <UNK> him <UNK> brooks is gorgeous and did great with what she had to do she had good chemistry with and like was especially good at the end as i loved her mysterious character michael <UNK> smith is wonderful as the monster man he was very creepy looking had some awesome makeup and is now one of my favorite slashers rest of the cast do fine br br overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
<START> too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut this film looks like it was put together by a <UNK> that couldn't decide if it was a comedy drama suspense or sci fi it starts out sort of playful then quickly gets darker and then at the end apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something it's totally weird and impossible to string together the acting is extremely uneven with the older professionals engaging your attention and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first run and art houses this would be a good film for a film class to analyze plot character theme <UNK> they are all either <UNK> or missing from this film
<START> this film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it <UNK> far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama none of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard tv movie stuff so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a jeff bridges fan as i am i guess br br bridges plays mike <UNK> a young man who <UNK> at a family <UNK> that he is <UNK> college to go on the road his parents believe he is just acting out and talk about how he has no plan he <UNK> them he does have a plan and that he needs to discover his true self and his place in the world so much so in fact that he invites them to go on the road with him and <UNK> an <UNK> bus to travel in which he and his father <UNK> in true tv movie father son bonding fashion up until about this point in the film i was somewhat interested in the plot and characters and i wanted to see how his stuck up mother vera miles was going to react to life on the road there's a funny scene early on where the father and son have to convince her to take the trip with them they show her the inside of the bus and she gradually becomes more and more interested finally <UNK> in a <UNK> with some kind of talk about <UNK> versus <UNK> on the windows bridges <UNK> to his dad carl <UNK> with radio <UNK> voice that she has changed her mind dad <UNK> him electric <UNK> works every time br br but the movie goes downhill almost as soon as they hit the road it turns out that <UNK> only plan is to introduce them to some friends of his who turn out to be random people who they meet at a hippie rock festival as soon as i saw the rock festival i was a bit disappointed particularly as it became obvious that the entire rest of the film would take place at the festival <UNK> and not actually on the road but at least i thought there might be a decent band like well if they couldn't afford <UNK> or the stones maybe they would at least have <UNK> heat or little feat or something like that no <UNK> apparently the only music at this festival is some horrible <UNK> group with orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the fifth dimension coupled with an annoying <UNK> who's supposed to be humorous br br also we are introduced to a set of <UNK> and their various medical <UNK> kathy <UNK> <UNK> is a pretty blonde girl with <UNK> and nature on her mind who falls in love with mike before revealing the fact that she needs <UNK> to live and has run off to the festival to die and 2 other <UNK> are determined to have a baby in their crude <UNK> introducing the struggle between modern medicine and <UNK> ignorance or something like that all in all the longer this goes on the more painful the film becomes for anyone hoping for any element of surprise or real drama br br basically this movie is a waste of time although it would probably <UNK> anyone who is really into the period of time in the late 60s early 70s and the films from that time i'd be just as happy if i never see it again though
<START> so boring you'll fall asleep after the 20 first minutes sorry mr i do admire your work all these beautiful films you directed such as sans etc but here the plot is extremely vain except the magnificent photography everything appears dumb and there's no envy to know what will happen at these medium actors moreover the dialogs are the famous question where are the children is repeated so often it looks like a farce believe me it's a pure waste of time concerning the plot and 3 hours is a long long time certainly the real reason of this box office total mess
<START> first time i ever saw this was at a friends house it ended up in his parents hands by a <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shop went <UNK> and treats like this was up for grabs we saw it two times in a row and almost wet are pants how hard we laughed br br i've seen historical documents like ninja mission and plan 9 from outer space and they still remain good <UNK> up in comparison to this one br br almost 15 years after first contact it is now considered the best cult movie of all times in my circles i've showed it to all my friends we now have a tradition of searching for movies in the same category the un one br br it can't be explained or reviewed in any normal way because every scene every take every move contains at least one mistake regarding editing <UNK> directing etc br br for any cult movie buff this is the ultimate prize the gem of all gems br br as for craft it can't be rated because it would even be an insult to <UNK> videos of <UNK> and <UNK> br br as for pure amusement it is the funniest movie i have ever seen funnier than any comedy ever made past or present anything less than a 10 10 should be regarded as an insult to good sense of hum our
<START> <UNK> feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece it's well acted and beautifully filmed but <UNK> written and way too short as is it's just a decent police <UNK> with hints of film noir at its <UNK> in <UNK> and social commentary also trendy at the time thrown in for good measure it's remembered today as one of the first two hollywood films to deal with anti <UNK> and as being much better than the similarly themed <UNK> <UNK> no mean feat but its real subject is the difficulty that wwii soldiers as trained killers were having as they made the transition to <UNK> life for a more <UNK> take on this topic try the best years of our lives a man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film we do not see his <UNK> the movie is about the investigation of this murder which is actually pretty straightforward but it takes some unnecessary <UNK> like when the main suspect a depressed soldier winds up in the apartment of gloria <UNK> a dance hall hooker with a really weird <UNK> played by paul kelly there's also a <UNK> lecture halfway through the movie that slows the proceedings to a crawl and the ending is <UNK> enough for a cop show but otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery still what a great noir it could have been director edward drops a few hints at the subject of the original novel homosexuality not anti <UNK> like when sadistic creep monty <UNK> at the image of his friend mitch talking with a strange man at a bar and the cast is excellent robert ryan makes for a very credible <UNK> and even becomes a little sympathetic in his final scenes not unlike peter lorre as the child murderer in m he deserved an oscar but lost to edmund <UNK> that year you can't beat santa claus robert mitchum is <UNK> as a soldier friend of the accused killer was mitchum a great actor or a great star someone else can figure that out but his sleepy eyes and <UNK> half smile work very well here since they imply that his character knows something everyone else doesn't and he does and robert young as the detective assigned to the murder is surprisingly gritty his usual <UNK> <UNK> even when he has to deliver the civil rights <UNK> <UNK> through the picture there's no question that bogart or tracy would have been brilliant in the role but neither of them were at rko in <UNK> so you'll just have to deal with dr still young is good enough to make you wish someone had cast him in a detective drama instead of father knows best which he hated and which drove him to alcoholism and suicide attempts the man deserved better than <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to <UNK> the video store shelves as bad as <UNK> no but that is not saying much like <UNK> on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is <UNK> by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek <UNK> br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with <UNK> are clearly <UNK> scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even <UNK> situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute <UNK> the rest br br several notable faces turn up to <UNK> it sleepy kevin <UNK> is a long way from his <UNK> days nick <UNK> shows up in <UNK> mode to take a check no more <UNK> please at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled <UNK> more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago
<START> idea is great spoiled big time by the judges br br why make fun of people if what the <UNK> say is true and as most of them say they spent their life saving on the invention the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people br br also it shows when they want to accept an idea by the that they added to the judges br br the only one i respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table he is a respectable person br br of course the english <UNK> who claims to be a business man wearing a <UNK> doesn't make you one pal br br last but not least the big guy who sits between the english and the wake up man the is no job called and <UNK> for you to call yourself one an <UNK> is an <UNK> not a job man br br i think they wanted to add someone like simon from the american idol they thought it worked there it can work here as well the context is different and the idea is totally different br br it is a good idea and they could have done a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude br br just stop making fun of the people
<START> this is a phenomenal movie truly one of the best movies i have ever watched i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me but this movie had all the right <UNK> for stirring the passion of the actors without the overacting the <UNK> for all the characters involved the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce all make this a must see movie despite the fact that it is 1970s this is definitely not an old movie but a classic vintage movie i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how <UNK> relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful but once they are made the pain will <UNK> but only gradually this movie certainly demonstrates that the most <UNK> relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not <UNK> with lost lack of love the of this movie certainly <UNK> from a place deep within someone's heart and mind
<START> let me <UNK> by stating that i have lived in <UNK> kentucky all of my life i grew up about <UNK> mile from <UNK> in the we would pull our down road and cross <UNK> highway to go <UNK> riding on <UNK> hill many times during the winter of <UNK> <UNK> we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves the place was still being run as a <UNK> center at the time we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the door to the <UNK> i have to be honest the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing i would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter nothing stranger than teen aged boys acting stupid ever happened i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years one evening when i was young we looked out our front <UNK> and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched the thing that gets lost about <UNK> is that many people survived <UNK> there let's face <UNK> doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people it took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how <UNK> <UNK> was too much is focused on those who suffered i also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70's we would go and visit shut ins in the <UNK> home through a church youth group by the way the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and as portrayed in the film they were wooden and too open it did smell of <UNK> and <UNK> and you saw the occasional open <UNK> associated with patients with <UNK> it was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80's a lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn't paid off this is after all kentucky the part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the <UNK> of bodies into a <UNK> if i am not mistaken it appears to have been holocaust footage that was added for dramatic effect it left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker i am a <UNK> when it comes to ghosts i do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted <UNK> for me however <UNK> a fun place for adventure for a boy with a <UNK>
<START> i just purchased this movie because i love to <UNK> to operation smile the charity on which the movie was based but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar <UNK> like the smile train and their <UNK> efforts to <UNK> the suffering of children born with facial <UNK> in third world countries no it concentrates on an american teenage <UNK> katie whose over <UNK> life in <UNK> california includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control <UNK> in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do <UNK> the audience it's 2005 i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a <UNK> teen wasn't on birth control and even if she is so what and who cares <UNK> katie is the character of lin in china a girl with a facial <UNK> who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with let alone understand the motivations of either girl on the other hand the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script the best performance was by the gentleman playing <UNK> father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled operation smile deserved to be <UNK> by a much better movie than this
<START> the lifetime channel aired this in october but i only got around to watching it now it's the old eternal triangle again  small town <UNK> boy dave ford matt long has a quick <UNK> with his best friend's girlfriend emily <UNK> on the eve of his departure for law school in new york thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing <UNK> and <UNK> runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big <UNK> five years later and gets involved with her <UNK> again but director and co writer matthew cole <UNK> goes way over the top framing the whole thing in flashback as dave <UNK> to murdering emily her husband and another one of her lovers in front of here comes the spoiler a lesbian cop who's also a flame of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the effect by which dave gets to see <UNK> of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead cutting those in even while dave and emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal i couldn't help but flash back myself to james m cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers all adapted into hit movies the <UNK> always rings twice double <UNK> and mildred pierce it also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys the bad girls actually <UNK> and the decent if <UNK> and stupid hero seemingly on his way to the lethal <UNK> table  or that the actors playing the people dave and emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are incidentally though this film went straight to cable in the u s there were some blank spots on the soundtrack <UNK> where swear words were so i presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world
<START> i usually can tolerate twisted movies but this one is really a sick obsessive self absorbed movie br br firstly the writer director is totally a self absorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all secondly he is also a sick <UNK> who <UNK> and <UNK> children's mind i can't believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kids br br i really feel sorry for zane and <UNK> <UNK> they are both very talented but fell prey to eric <UNK> dirty little known movie br br and what the hell happened to eric good looking face i mean he met this girl that he's supposed to marry but he wasn't in the wedding in fact there is this bald guy in his place did time really fly that fast br br anyway don't waste your time to see this movie unless you want to be <UNK> and manipulated by one sick eric <UNK>
<START> don't know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just <UNK> and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> on criminals only i did find it odd that <UNK> didn't seem to have indian friends i know their numbers were <UNK> but it still strikes me as strange even as <UNK> returned to his people his indian <UNK> remain <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i was surprised that i liked this movie but it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first friday the 13th there were a number of cheesy elements yet at the same time there were many cool ones the story line was good predictable if you have seen more than one or two horror movies but full of one liners to make it worthwhile there are some memorable scenes worth watching a few issues i had with the plot had to do with the continuity of the characters for instance in the opening scene the scarecrows which were humans on stakes whose blood was <UNK> to grow the <UNK> looked very real but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue colored masks there were more than several gaps in the plot and the acting was mediocre but at least it sounded like how real people talk unlike hollywood movies where the dialogue is really fake sounding when you think about it the <UNK> of the last scene when the main character says i'm not a baker i'm a and the head off of the scarecrow is satisfying as his friends have for the most part been killed off by these creatures at that point
<START> obviously a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their <UNK> for this <UNK> minute to the <UNK> complex br br sure the film could have been alright had the 1 million been left out of it seriously the amount of the check doesn't matter prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of love <UNK> all can change the fact that no marriage <UNK> ever meant to imply for <UNK> for <UNK> for <UNK> as in <UNK> picture the story otherwise though 2 kids flat broke borderline desperate and completely stupid they <UNK> with wealthy business man kids' marriage is strained by <UNK> times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser enter mr <UNK> <UNK> charm and <UNK> a virtual <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> clock and with him the wife's temptation tensions suspense whom will she choose maybe under those conditions i could actually care as is frankly <UNK> selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character a woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will <UNK> out his wife the <UNK> <UNK> makes the husband a total loser <UNK> in every positive male characteristic and makes the wife a cheap <UNK> <UNK> by money rather than confused by another potential love a woman devoid of moral center and self respect br br all the impressive talent acting directing cinematography wasted on this film and it was an impressive amount couldn't save it from its <UNK> but too trashy 1 million pitch line if i see this turkey at one more <UNK> shower i'm going to <UNK> it or maybe cross it with titanic and pitch the tape in the ocean
<START> when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974 if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today br br the topic of the film deals with the old question what is real and what is illusion if you see the matrix you will find a lot of similarities but the two films are not comparable at all because <UNK> am is art and the matrix is entertainment if prefer the first one br br unfortunately i lost my video copy of it br br
<START> there are many reasons i'm not a fan of fact based films but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story if they have such great <UNK> then why not use that talent to make something original otherwise stick to the facts this could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that ed <UNK> was an insanely frightening human being it's been said if you were to take michael myers jason <UNK> and <UNK> wrap them into one person ed <UNK> would still be <UNK> scarier so why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this when will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction br br i've read books and watched news programs about him and now i'm not a screenwriter or anything but i believe there's enough <UNK> on <UNK> that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented i'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and <UNK> there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the <UNK> relationship with his mother and girlfriend as filler and far too much of it br br i guess what i'm wondering is this why at the end of the movie did i know more about the supporting characters than i did about ed <UNK> why didn't we get to know his mother father and brother and the relationships between them what made him the psychopath he was what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became instead the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy running br br in the end i give it 4 10 stars thats 2 for the gore and 2 for kane <UNK> even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion considering <UNK> was a man and possibly <UNK> and <UNK> is anything but small and nowhere near what i would consider feminine maybe i was just excited because he was jason <UNK>
<START> this film starts out with all the moody promise of a great contemporary noir western after the ill conceived opening flashback sequence anyway the scenery is beautifully desolate the characters <UNK> isolated while some of the acting is less than believable the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this movie worth a look
<START> i watched two very different holmes adventures this morning but you would be amazed at the similarities br br the was presumably the first collaboration between basil <UNK> if i were king romeo and juliet and <UNK> bruce and director roy william <UNK> it was not their first sherlock holmes adventure as they did one a couple of years before this br br the made an excellent team but i prefer the hammer version which i will talk about later br br holmes relies on a lot of <UNK> to do his work and i am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out they always seem to dash on when they find a new clue br br the story itself about keeping a bomb site from the germans in wwii was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery
<START> if i wouldn't have had any expectations of this film it might have received a 5 or 6 as it stands i give it a 3 the acting is poor the factual accuracy of the drugs it <UNK> is lacking and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the characters br br i watched immediately before watching this film and i both laughed and cried on several occasions this film did not strike even a similar <UNK> the directors of <UNK> may have some off hand experience of ecstasy but there is no <UNK> of actual drug related <UNK> knowledge here in fact i find it rather offensive and to the <UNK> of making current drug laws less politically oriented br br watch <UNK> for a <UNK> if what you're looking for is an amazing touching film about drugs
<START> a buster keaton silent short br br poor buster becomes the goat <UNK> for a dangerous escaped murderer br br this is a wonderful hilarious little film with keaton at his absolute best in what is essentially a series of chases buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination big joe roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief br br born into a family of <UNK> buster keaton <UNK> 1966 <UNK> physical comedy at a very early age an association with <UNK> <UNK> led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic silent feature length films all from <UNK> to <UNK> writer director star <UNK> buster could do it all and his <UNK> genius gave him almost <UNK> knowledge as to the <UNK> of film making and of what it took to please an audience more akin to fairbanks than chaplin <UNK> films were full of splendid adventure exciting <UNK> do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable his theme of a little man against the world who <UNK> through bravery <UNK> <UNK> his films through every <UNK> disaster buster remained the great stone face a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad br br in the late <UNK> buster was betrayed by his manager brother in law and his contract was sold to mgm which <UNK> to nearly destroy his career teamed initially with jimmy <UNK> and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent finally before lung cancer took him at age 70 he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being <UNK> now well past his <UNK> buster keaton is <UNK> recognized appreciated as one of <UNK> true authentic geniuses and he knew how to make people laugh
<START> good idea shame about the actual movie would of liked it to be a bit more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was if she was torturing those kids why were they helping her kill and not helping others kill her its a bit of a come down from malcolm in the middle br br i think it would of <UNK> from being slightly longer and going into more detail with the characters although after about an hour i was wondering when it would end br br would of been better too if the actual characters that killed them were not in reality it sort of made them crap looking and what happened to the frankie character he fell into a bed of wild <UNK> so should of been safe however the computer game showed him as game over ie dead next thing he appears with that irritating blonde <UNK> to rescue the guy afraid of fire who i noticed had no <UNK> about flipping the lighter when demon lady was after him br br too many inconsistencies in this movie to really enjoy it however might make you think twice about playing that new computer game
<START> pearl harbor buddy this movie is brilliant sure it doesn't exactly flow like an multi million dollar comedy does but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are unbelievable i'm one that goes for silliness much like dumb and dumber airplane and wet hot american summer and i have to say this easily ranks up there movies just aren't written with this kind of <UNK> comedy anymore too many jokes in this are such a surprise to the viewer that it's honestly amazing that more don't know about and praise this slapstick masterpiece when watching this you will easily find over 20 quotes from it that you will find yourself <UNK> after <UNK> and after to watch it again you'll find even more
<START> this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such <UNK> i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a <UNK> and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the <UNK> never changed although <UNK> earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need me us now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity <UNK> <UNK> courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a <UNK> movie any <UNK> of 2001 a space odyssey will find the movie <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> movie <UNK> is more story <UNK> than 2001
<START> if you are going to watch this film because michael caine or michael are in it then don't bother it's not their typical role although i found fantastic instead watch it for dylan <UNK> i am a fan of everything i have seen him in and this is no exception i didn't even realise he could act but even the characters which he has to pass himself off as i found completely believable which is impressive considering the audience knows they are fake br br the plot is genius and although it is not constant laughs all the way through it has plenty of other charms a great film for people with a sense of humour

<START> any movie that has a line of dialogue that goes something like this <UNK> getting ready for her date has to be good i found this on dvd <UNK> <UNK> and was pleasantly surprised a lot of hard work was put into making this movie i actually enjoyed this more that a lot of 80s movies i have seen great addition to my movie collection br br the <UNK> was great sets up the scares for the rest of the movie loved the gore and the t a i never thought <UNK> being <UNK> out would look like popping <UNK> the color of the eye splatter was gross i keep thinking that looked like tiger woods but more black anyone agree
<START> worst movie ever made ever i have no words to say about it other then it truly had no point no plot no anything sheer crap i don't know how everyone in the movie didn't shoot them shelves after watching it i love vampire flicks and mysteries and alternate abstract outside the box films and this was non of those i mean what the crap i cant even tell you what the film was about <UNK> i still don't know and i just wasted an hour and of my life watching it bottom line i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs thats the only thing i got from this film please don't watch this i mean for a <UNK> sensual vampire flick there wasn't even the to be expected nudity you'd get from a <UNK> flick anyway back to my point this movie blows go set yourself on fire instead
<START> at first i didn't think that the performance by lauren <UNK> was anything but <UNK> but as her character developed the portrayal made more sense amy <UNK> seemed too <UNK> for her role and didn't really tie her daughter's characters together even though it was apparent that her character was <UNK> with the character played by lauren <UNK> br br christopher lloyd is a hit as usual and carried off his role to encourage the story line his character development left the audience wondering why he was <UNK> by the younger characters and could have been accomplished more directly with br br the overwhelming <UNK> to this somewhat vague story line was play by taylor roberts her <UNK> delivery of a simplistic character held the movie together in this pivotal role taylor was able to encourage a realistic family relationship between the characters while acting as the antagonist for all of the other relationships in the film
<START> an interesting period showing us what was amazing in 1938 gosh ma a fake accident ring <UNK> for 25 000 i guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money the acting would amount to pure 21st century ham nice to see the president as a hard working newcomer
<START> i haven't laughed this much in a long time or seen a film so <UNK> made talk about so bad it made me laugh br br firstly i <UNK> that for about 40 percent of the film's length i couldn't tell what was happening or indeed even what i was seeing i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets <UNK> there are whole segments minutes long where all you can see are <UNK> flashes and <UNK> of cave wall people and various other <UNK> stuff i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening but they couldn't follow it any better than me br br then there are the black moments when in an effort to scare us everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black and i don't just mean for a few seconds i think the longest lasted almost two minutes i guess blank film is one way to keep costs down br br i suspect the director had recently read a book on all the must <UNK> to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all in about 20 times each br br there are three good things about this film 1 it's short at 90 minutes though still an hour and a half too long 2 all the characters die after all it's impossible to care about any of them 3 there was one genuinely good scene when the group are looking up the <UNK> they came down after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom saw that coming a large <UNK> is pushed across the opening <UNK> them in i wasn't expecting that and it was genuinely chilling br br and what's with the early <UNK> scenes with the shot after shot after shot <UNK> from behind the camp lights i swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes br br and i'm positive that after the first kill the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds br br all in all a crap piece of film making i'll watch almost anything but this is close to where i'd draw the line
<START> talk about your wild life barely a b movie but what the <UNK> corny sci fi and lesbian sex from the mind of writer and director cody <UNK> a cheesy slice of fun a chemical company is <UNK> waste that is causing mutants in a fish farm the hot <UNK> russell stars as dr barbara michaels an agent sent to investigate this <UNK> dilemma she just happens to enter a lesbian relationship with bartender <UNK> <UNK> and their love scenes are about as good as this film gets a man size frog <UNK> chaos causing a car crash <UNK> the chemical company <UNK> daughter <UNK> a girl under the <UNK> at a football game stiff arm <UNK> a runner in the football game <UNK> a nun all before being shot twice in the chest after an <UNK> was found all ready the special effects well not special a guy in a rubber frog costume without the <UNK> to prove himself tough do you still want to watch it go ahead but <UNK> any witness to <UNK>
<START> i loved this movie so worth the long running time i need help with the ending though br br spoiler br br the final shot of marie at the end is this to suggest that she is still searching for or possibly that she was the one who wanted to <UNK> the 13 she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to colin in the first place i don't quite understand it but i know i really liked it so if anyone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it please elaborate on the ending br br thanks
<START> i love sarah and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the <UNK> version of <UNK> the <UNK> which although beautiful to look at was let down by <UNK> not being able to sing and <UNK> <UNK> not being able to act is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours br br i <UNK> have worried the adaptation was excellent very little cut out and went along at a cracking pace although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book would you miss things it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book br br the acting was stellar sally <UNK> acting her heart out as sue <UNK> and <UNK> cassidy a slow <UNK> who by the end of the story was <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the love the passion the <UNK> of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform were written on their faces it was a joy to watch br br i hope <UNK> <UNK> was watching that's how you play a sarah waters character
<START> like the blair witch project before it <UNK> has garnered its own fair share of publicity from the bottom on up as an avid reader of <UNK> magazine the full page ads are hard to miss even after its <UNK> theatrical run the film is bound to <UNK> solely on the hype surrounding it and will probably turn into a cult item at some point with a <UNK> <UNK> and a mighty if <UNK> <UNK> promise of <UNK> so called old school american horror <UNK> will draw a lot of curiosity <UNK> with its dvd release where that claim is <UNK> on the disc itself perhaps it was the large print <UNK> from ain't it cool news on the ads that caused me to approach the film with some <UNK> it seems that harry <UNK> and his <UNK> will <UNK> of any film for <UNK> passes and free food but <UNK> makes me question what writer director adam <UNK> idea of old school american horror really is based on the evidence here it means the insipid late '80s rip offs of friday the 13th and deliverance the characters are obnoxious stereotypes black chris tucker type <UNK> chick topless <UNK> requisite old couple asian tour guide whose interactions are marred by painful trying to be hip dialogues and mostly obvious stabs at humor not quite as bad as cabin fever but still the script has too much padding the <UNK> bush scene for example and <UNK> winds up as typical as any <UNK> slasher of the last decade with its only <UNK> <UNK> an expertly <UNK> hype machine i'll give it some faint praise for the gore if you can <UNK> through the padding in between kills the red is definitely a thing of wonder and the only real reason to watch this
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen and what disappoints me the most is that this is <UNK> raj film so at first when you see the <UNK> you think yes thats definitely another <UNK> raj hit but when you see the film your eyes will water with disappoint the storyline is stupid and dumb we've seen it many times boy is soon to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah if you do see this pathetic film don't go with you family there is too much exposure and kiss scene i don even see why you would go to see it on your own overall this is a <UNK> disgusting and anything else which is bad and starts with a d film don't go to see it you'll end up hating <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> raj films
<START> this is one of those films you can have on for a couple of hours on a sunday morning able to do other things with no real complications in losing any understanding of the proceedings and gaining some fascination in wondering why such <UNK> acquired the <UNK> and financial resources to be produced in the first place br br of course with all the cable channels as well as <UNK> need to fill its time <UNK> with 100 or so hours worth of movies per week along with <UNK> golden girls reruns this type of fare is now a t v <UNK> also it seems these flicks provide <UNK> to the canadian locales where most are made as well as the host of canadian actors appearing in them br br <UNK> spelling like the <UNK> face paris hilton is somebody who if not for family connections and resources would likely be working at the gap but at least <UNK> has become say a c level <UNK> appearing in occasional <UNK> appropriate to this level br br this story is one which has been seen on lifetime and similar <UNK> god knows how many times <UNK> woman a total <UNK> trying to screw up everyone else's lives operating during the initial parts of the story with more <UNK> than a cia <UNK> could <UNK> committing murder when necessary and out to wreck the life of the <UNK> heroine br br as usual the male lead is a completely clueless <UNK> and in these types of films one finds say characters about whom one can really care about 10 of the time this one is in the other 90
<START> i loved this movie it's the finest parody of russian cinema to date who else but <UNK> could lampoon <UNK> so brilliantly you thought stalker was slow well step up to the plate <UNK> i makes stalker look like <UNK> of the lost <UNK> by no means should you miss this film there's no excuse even if you live a busy life you can still enjoy this film to its <UNK> by holding down the fast forward button on your vcr <UNK> has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes br br i suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all 45 minutes of a black silent screen wasn't this already explored in in the soup br br apparently the filmmaker and fans have forgotten that motion is the first word of motion picture br br major spoilers ahead br br want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved here's a step by step guide br br 1 find a talented photographer br br 2 find some subjects and a suitably <UNK> landscape think <UNK> if you need inspiration watch some luxury car or <UNK> commercials br br 3 shoot about 3 rolls of film br br 4 <UNK> the results to play around with <UNK> <UNK> aspect ratio br br 5 now just get out your movie camera film 40 of the best pictures and have your actors <UNK> their lines off screen don't worry about writing it ahead of time just let the actors say whatever they want lines like do you want a drink and let's get something to eat are really all you need to fill up 8 minutes or so if you can't think of enough dialog no problem just have them repeat what they say a few times if that still isn't enough just let the camera run anyway br br <UNK> another masterpiece as a bonus if you want to <UNK> it over the internet no problem the static images will <UNK> down to nothing with standard a 73 minute movie would probably be about 2 3 even at the highest quality levels
<START> one of the best and most exciting of all conspiracy thrillers there were a number of such film in the 1970's this one is about an accident at a <UNK> and of the attempts to cover it up jack lemmon is the employee who realizes just how dangerous the plant is and jane fonda is the <UNK> television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best br br the events portrayed in the film are of course terrifying and not in the least bit far fetched much of what happens here happened in real life at three mile island and although it now looks like something a period piece it nevertheless highlights just how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves expect a number of similar films about the effects of global warming any time soon and not rubbish like the day after tomorrow either
<START> female convict <UNK> beast stable the third in the series is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze closer in tone and subject to a violent than other <UNK> entries it is stunningly photographed directed with lurid enthusiasm and populated with a <UNK> gallery of villains and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the director of the first installment returns for this surreal fable which begins with <UNK> cutting the arm off a cop she is <UNK> to and fleeing into the tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her <UNK> she takes <UNK> in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute who is first seen seen having incestuous <UNK> with her brother who ends up <UNK> her <UNK> desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose she is beaten sexually <UNK> and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the <UNK> <UNK> i loved everything about this hypnotic <UNK> and emotionally touching movie it is the superior of the three first <UNK> films and features one great scene after another i can't recommend it highly enough
<START> all i can say about this movie is it is absolutely boring the intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film i have ever seen i mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a <UNK> pan isn't at all frightening which is what i assume the director was aiming for but in fact it was mildly funny br br the acting in this picture was beyond pathetic a note to directors if your making a horror film please hire some good actors not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act br br the death scenes in this movie were beyond boring no gore and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore or good suspense are just cheesy i mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of tokyo and not one person sees it happen they just <UNK> her as missing wow thats awesome br br in conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie make sure u bring some sleeping <UNK> because i guarantee you won't make it to the end me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end br br cheers
<START> or if you've seen the evil dead trilogy and or <UNK> ho <UNK> then you should know that his movies are total <UNK> with man with the screaming brain he goes all out again in this case he plays smarmy american businessman william cole visiting <UNK> when do we ever get to see that country when a woman kills him so strange scientist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> half of <UNK> brain with the brain of a former <UNK> agent leaving him acting sort of like steve martin in all of me br br yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense much of the real humor comes from evil dead director sam <UNK> brother ted as nearly brain dead assistant the two men have a relationship more like laurel and hardy or <UNK> and the <UNK> br br so just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you won't be a bit disappointed i liked it anyway
<START> if you haven't seen this film do it its a as i've never seen another some very surreal scenes some hilarious funny stuff a film noir <UNK> musical numbers with a swing sex scenes the 2nd best played <UNK> on film <UNK> only by sally a pitch of orson welles <UNK> together into a work of art as an work of art it hasn't to be logical at the end at least not logical for everybody i owned an tv copy on vhs but <UNK> it to an ex girlfriend and now i can't get it back but the film should be out on dvd in <UNK> on 10 <UNK> <UNK> and be sure i will buy it
<START> i'm an opera buff and operas are full of sex blood and death it may help to know the of the operas the <UNK> are from to really appreciate this film my <UNK> is very different than <UNK> 3 i am a classical music lover and i liked this film br br i loved ken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> segment and would actually like to see him produce <UNK> because opera is supposed to be overwhelming truly multi media experience but then i loved i love <UNK> and knowing the <UNK> so well may be why i don't find this segment the travesty that <UNK> 3 did br br the buck henry <UNK> segment is probably the most <UNK> for the average viewer they are likely to recognize the tunes and its a classic bedroom farce i like bedroom <UNK> so the silliness didn't upset me br br the segment is so outstanding that i recommend people watch this for that piece alone la <UNK> was for me beautifully spiritual and the caruso recording of la aka i with john hurt as the clown was wonderful but people just wanting naked women may feel there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex
<START> one unfortunate reality of post soviet russia was that the people's <UNK> didn't change much from soviet times as we see in window to paris most people are still as depressed as ever while they are encouraged to go after money br br then everything changes for music teacher <UNK> <UNK> after he finds a window that leads to paris he and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find this movie has one of the funniest discussions of elvis <UNK> and edith <UNK> that i've ever heard so watch this movie you're sure to love it it's sort of a <UNK> to being john <UNK>
<START> wow i saw this movie and up on the same day within an hour of each other at different theaters i saw mr bug first and was then totally disappointed in up 's follow up what a beautiful and touching film movies of the 1930s and 40s to us nowadays can be with their melodramatic acting and dialog but as animation the same melodrama and <UNK> humor can be wonderful and the soft <UNK> lines of 30s drawing and the music just puts you in a nice comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flies <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and more each with all their own cute little but not overbearing <UNK> the interaction with the human world from nemesis <UNK> <UNK> high <UNK> <UNK> innocent kick the can playing kids to the kind hearted and to the unknown <UNK> is realistic and fascinating you care for the bugs and dick and mary the protagonist is not some perfect superman who comes to set things right but a <UNK> eyed <UNK> who leads everyone down the garden path literally and every time you think it's going to end happily in 1930s style along comes another <UNK> i was on the edge of my seat much more than with up i walked out of the movie theater <UNK> and <UNK> something that hasn't happened in a long long long long time
<START> ok just what the hell is all this supposed to mean halloween 6 let's just call it that ok is without a doubt the most confusing film in the series and from what i've heard seeing the original producers cut doesn't sound like it makes things any less <UNK> than the official release what a mess br br this isn't a really bad film as some have said it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments it just doesn't make any sense don't tell me that michael was <UNK> from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy and blah blah blah it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee <UNK> brother just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film this is too much br br it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be too smart by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all bad move guys we're not looking for an explanation of why michael kills so please don't try and feed us this crap show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people show me dr <UNK> trying to track him down and as always coming up just short don't waste what turned out to be the last performance of donald <UNK> by telling me in the most confusing way possible that michael was created by some cult from hell and that his seed will be passed on to another and oh brother br br halloween 6 has its moments don't get me wrong and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this <UNK> anyone so get what you can out of it the scene toward the end of the film with michael <UNK> down a deep red <UNK> is particularly effective and try to ignore the screwball plot hopefully one day we can all see the <UNK> cut and maybe get the chance to make a bit more sense out of all of this till then this will have to do br br
<START> it's just stories some we wish happen to us some we wish never happen to us all about <UNK> desire the locations and nude bodies are beautiful but after the second story all i could think was <UNK> takes more than just beauty to create a real <UNK> then of course the film unfolds the stories are moving except sophie fails to communicate her story in this film <UNK> plays the story for both of them though the <UNK> fails to link the stories but helps <UNK> to <UNK> some thought br br i'd say it is worth seeing and the best of antonioni i have seen given his age remarkable
<START> the first time i watched this show it was ok there were some funny moments and i laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse <UNK> and <UNK> web show is not the least bit funny they play a stupid video from the internet scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes and then the laugh track goes off one problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny <UNK> is not funny miranda acting is lackluster at best her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from drake and josh her friend sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of <UNK> i mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck her mom <UNK> an old tv with a bat and then there's the jokes about sam failing in school getting <UNK> all the time and running from cops none of that is funny at all then there's freddy who is a computer geek he isn't too funny unless his mom is treating him like a baby the show's only somewhat funny full time character is brother spencer he makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises knocking over a girl cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him his material is the only thing worth laughing at aside from the characters other things make the show bad too like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to tokyo another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled <UNK> and a green screen and an <UNK> camera this sounds like it was written by a 10 year old the worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content there are a couple of times when <UNK> remember a 13 year old girl appears on her internet web show in a bikini top wtf then i saw an episode where freddy tells <UNK> and sam that he slept in just his <UNK> the night before i mean wtf then there's an episode where rival <UNK> her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss creepy and i just saw an episode where <UNK> meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and <UNK> stands there <UNK> over him i can't believe nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and i can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for drake and josh this show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable is just another addition to the long list of awful nick programming
