<START> for those curious this episode is based in theme upon play six characters in search of an author and jean paul <UNK> play no exit as <UNK> most obviously by its title but of course with a sterling twist br br five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their <UNK> a bell <UNK> rings perhaps also a <UNK> <UNK> increasing the agony of their <UNK> the newcomer to the group a major is determined to escape while the others are <UNK> to their fate br br unlike these characters don't even have a story they have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness and no one to author their nonexistent story so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in piece unlike both and <UNK> there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them though the theme of personal responsibility versus <UNK> is prominent in this story br br though this <UNK> significantly from the storyline of the authors <UNK> to in the title themes of <UNK> and and many other authors of the <UNK> century come through with absolute clarity this is very obviously a piece which <UNK> post <UNK> perspective in the context of the cold war era there is also an emphasis upon issues of personal <UNK> br br this is easily one of the best episodes i've seen and still exceptionally relevant to current experience as are <UNK> and exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic
<START> twenty years later this movie still remains as entertaining as when you first watched it in a movie market <UNK> by toilet humor graphic violence and foul language it's refreshing to be fully entertained for two hours by such a clean movie
<START> the subject of children being <UNK> ill is difficult and <UNK> but 'the <UNK> successfully portrays the idea that it doesn't have to be all doom and <UNK> and if anything children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end it is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood br br the film sees <UNK> a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother moving into a new area where their next door <UNK> is eleven year old <UNK> who <UNK> aids through a blood <UNK> after his initial fears and ignorance over aids are <UNK> befriends <UNK> and their almost <UNK> friendship sees them <UNK> on a journey down the <UNK> to where they have heard about a new orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease br br the talent from the two young leads of brad and joseph who play <UNK> and <UNK> respectively is exceptional brad was able to portray <UNK> harder edge without <UNK> the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to <UNK> character but <UNK> the right amount of <UNK> enthusiasm and <UNK> to highlight that his illness doesn't mean he still isn't a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven year old boy the <UNK> interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well <UNK> <UNK> also delivers a touching performance as <UNK> mother linda who <UNK> her son and <UNK> in seeing him <UNK> with this new friendship to <UNK> and eventually becomes a surrogate mother figure to the other boy br br set against an excellent soundtrack 'the <UNK> is a very bittersweet film that manages to <UNK> <UNK> the story of <UNK> friendship that survives <UNK> in the midst of prejudice and <UNK> illness without <UNK> to <UNK> or unnecessary <UNK> sweet scenes a very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with <UNK> aids status whereas the children even the come to accept him as they would any other what is also very touching is how despite <UNK> <UNK> nature he is the more naive one in his determination to cure <UNK> while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend's enthusiasm for a cure br br i highly recommend 'the <UNK> for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting
<START> apart from the fact that this film was made i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular the one thing that puzzled me about guest house <UNK> was what happened to the lighting there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever and i watched it on network tv so it <UNK> t a case of watching a dodgy tape in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on but if the dialogue was anything to go by that s maybe not a bad thing
<START> over the past century there have been many advances in gender <UNK> but not so much in the world of movies i'm not talking about what goes on behind the camera i'm referring to the tastes of the audience the idea of a chick flick is alive and well today while there are still plenty of action and horror films which appeal primarily to males sure there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside of their typical <UNK> but there aren't many movies which have appeals across the board <UNK> the latest will smith vehicle attempts to change that trend by being a chick flick which throws in a dose of male perspective br br smith stars in <UNK> as the title character alex <UNK> <UNK> a date doctor who trains men on how to approach a woman and have a successful date <UNK> enjoys his job and loves to see men successfully accomplish their goals of going out with the woman of their dreams but due to a bad experience in college <UNK> himself is somewhat <UNK> on the idea of love as the story unfolds the film introduces two seemingly separate story lines <UNK> latest case is albert kevin james an <UNK> who is very attracted to one of his <UNK> the beautiful <UNK> cole <UNK> <UNK> has his doubts about <UNK> chances but if his <UNK> desires seem sincere <UNK> supports them br br in the mean time <UNK> meets <UNK> <UNK> sara eva <UNK> and is instantly attracted to this strong woman however the date doctor can't seem to follow his own advice in pursuing sara things get even more complicated when <UNK> job leads her to investigate the relationship between the <UNK> and the <UNK> will <UNK> be able to balance his private life and his job and more importantly can <UNK> believe in love again if you are a true movie fan then there's been at least one time in your life when you've complained about the <UNK> of the hollywood movie factory and cried out for something new and original well <UNK> ain't that movie but most movie fans will also admit that occasionally a formulaic movie can work solely on an entertainment level <UNK> does qualify as that film
<START> the problem with this movie is that it isn't funny it isn't scary it isn't dramatic it isn't intriguing it isn't stimulating it isn't it isn't exciting it isn't even the slightest bit interesting i saw this film recently on tape and i was glad i didn't spent any money to rent it it's basically a poor attempt at film making i won't even bother to tell you the story story what story
<START> a very delightful bit of <UNK> that should have had wider distribution ian <UNK> is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets <UNK> because he won't go along with the program and sets out to let the world know what they're missing the supporting cast is great as well and the music is the soul of the film i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library
<START> first of all i hardly ever watch swedish movies and this is actually the second time in my life i watch a swedish movie on cinema <UNK> i believe it's one of the best swedish movies ever the combination of thrill and humour is outstanding and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh the plot is about this man a writer who wants to go to germany after world war ii and help the germans to start over on the way to germany he is trying to help his friends on the train which is however a bad idea what a clumsy jerk and poor robert the wounded soldier always get in the way <UNK> but he still got his great mood a positive guy robert have done some less great movies the last years or so and this is really a relief he is great in this movie after all this is one of the best swedish movies ever and peter <UNK> has made an excellent job <UNK>
<START> what a nasty cynical film apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst <UNK> through the <UNK> of sydney <UNK> is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market made by some industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into <UNK> <UNK> people deservedly failed miserably at the australian box office it is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or <UNK> to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting <UNK> people might have been interesting or even informative if not <UNK> by its <UNK> view of <UNK> teens want to see in a <UNK> the character played by ben is particularly offensive and <UNK> <UNK> is again wasted by poor material and <UNK> film makers it is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less well the were very wrong a mini budget film made in 1983 called going down got this topic right and is an excellent <UNK> to this poison
<START> scarecrow gone wild starts as high school teenager mike david <UNK> his mates decide to to give a to <UNK> <UNK> sam <UNK> as an <UNK> of some sort mike his mate decide to take sam to a corn field tie him to a cross next to a freaky looking scarecrow leave him there all night sounds like fun right well things <UNK> when sam goes into a <UNK> coma after suffering from a <UNK> the vengeful spirit of sam passes into the scarecrow which comes to life starts to hunt down the kids responsible for <UNK> unfortunate life threatening <UNK> can <UNK> best mate jack matthew his girlfriend beth samantha <UNK> save the day <UNK> life br br written directed by brian scarecrow gone wild is the third straight to video entry in the scarecrow series while i haven't seen either of the previous two after seeing scarecrow gone wild i'm certainly in no hurry to change that situation that's for sure the script actually has an almost decent premise as the <UNK> soul of sam seeks revenge his friends have to keep the real sam alive somehow but the way it is told is poor i suppose that basically it's just an <UNK> to the fact that this is a film about a killer scarecrow running around killing people in not very gory or imaginative ways having said that there are one or two scenes here which save it from a one star rating the fart gag in the corn field is funny something a lot of immature <UNK> might do like me the bit when two guys bury their mate in the sand then stand over him pee on him is also rather funny in a <UNK> juvenile way a cool bit when some guy starts singing an awful song so the scarecrow throws a pole which <UNK> him however these ok bits are few far between as a whole it's a silly boring poorly written teen slasher film with highly annoying character's who <UNK> <UNK> also very predictable has a stupid twist ending which doesn't really feature the scarecrow at all which is a problem as when you watch a film called scarecrow gone wild you expect to see a scarecrow go wild i have to admit he looks quite cool as horror character's go br br director does a reasonable job here actually although what on earth is up with that hospital at the end all that <UNK> lighting everywhere the fact there is only one patient there two members of staff the cinematography is much better than the usual straight to video low budget horror film of late there's some nice if totally unrealistic lighting the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical <UNK> used throughout is a bit <UNK> to say the least i say that as an <UNK> <UNK> myself there's not much gore here there's a couple of scenes where some actor has some fake guts placed on their stomach to represent them being <UNK> but it looks pretty fake there's also a burned face a couple of but little else there's a fair amount of naked female breasts on show if that's your thing br br technically scarecrow gone wild is pretty good considering some of the low budget <UNK> i've sat through recently unfortunately it's still a poor film overall the least said about the acting the better br br scarecrow gone wild isn't as bad as some of the straight to video horror crap that's been turning up recently but having said that it's not that much better it's still a bad film when all said done not recommended the two previous entries are scarecrow 2002 scarecrow <UNK> 2003 both of which also went straight to video
<START> i was turned on to this movie by my flight <UNK> and now i wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before i finally discovered it if you have any love of flying at all especially an <UNK> to the planes of wwii this is an absolute must see vastly superior to the pathetic pearl harbor and up there in rivalry with the famed battle of britain filmed more than thirty years ago there are moments when you feel as if you are flying literally <UNK> the shell <UNK> of your leader as you roll in on a me <UNK> or he <UNK> br br as an <UNK> this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by <UNK> of thousands of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> who in 1939 1940 <UNK> their <UNK> made it to england fought with <UNK> bravery for the survival of western civilization and then were so <UNK> abandoned by us after the war when they were arrested by the <UNK> upon their return to their native lands i have stood <UNK> <UNK> in italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the polish troops that <UNK> that mountain that british and americans could not take i have traveled as well to <UNK> the most beautiful of cities and studied their history their story of <UNK> i believe should be a lesson to us even today about <UNK> to <UNK> allies br br but back to the film if you love flying see this if you are interested in the aircraft of wwii most definitely see it without doubt the most brutal direct and <UNK> swift air combat scenes ever <UNK> for film and yes if you even are seeking a touching romance there is that as well in heartbreaking detail br br bill professor of history co owner of a wwii <UNK> p <UNK> <UNK> gloria ann
<START> i didn't know much about this movie going in my roommate kind of dragged me into it i was so pleasantly surprised the plot really grabbed my attention and held it and the characters are well drawn and realistic the screenplay is very clever and funny and the cast does great things with it and the best part is that it managed to be entertaining without any explicit sex or violence if this movie comes anywhere into your area you really should go see it stand up for this little film it is worth it
<START> this movie might be o k if not for all the language in it i think that the storyline itself isn't bad but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually that's true but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the <UNK> of entertainment br br i used to quite like robert <UNK> he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them if we had an award for over use of the f word he would have to be a <UNK> unfortunately i think he's now lost me as a fan when i see his name on movies in future i will be thinking twice about picking up that title br br look i'm no <UNK> i use language sometimes too in extreme circumstances but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t something which we hope will bring us some joy and <UNK> i do not want to be reminded of what's happening out on the streets in any big city these days and it's a <UNK> to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watch br br i like matt <UNK> too but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this he probably did an o k job in the movie but i turned off about 1 4 of the way through after having had my ears <UNK> once too often by others in the cast why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this <UNK> language once enough actors especially the big names kick up a fuss about it the writers will stop putting it in the movies br br i'm sorry but i cannot recommend this picture it's a pity too because i think it would probably have been alright if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch thank god i only wasted 2 00 on it
<START> <UNK> flower was a delightful 1969 comedy based on a neil simon play about a dentist walter matthau having an affair with a young free spirited woman goldie hawn totally unaware that his devoted nurse assistant ingrid bergman is in love with him matthau can play this kind of role in his sleep and he doesn't disappoint as the <UNK> dentist dr julian winston who is dating one woman but really has no clue that he's in love with another goldie hawn won an oscar for her <UNK> performance as toni simmons the aging flower child who slowly comes to realize she is trapped in a dead end affair and is not as dim as she appears on the surface but the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary ingrid bergman as stephanie dickinson dr <UNK> completely devoted assistant who is willing to to bury and sacrifice her own happiness as long as dr winston is happy with tony bergman is <UNK> in this film looking absolutely beautiful though the camera has always loved her and showing an <UNK> knack for light comedy yes the dialogue and the settings are slightly dated but the story is timeless and the performances by the stars make it <UNK> watchable
<START> the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times it had a corny <UNK> adventure feel to it of course kathy is gorgeous but that voice did she realize this was a <UNK> one word voice coach great film for <UNK> insomnia along with a bottle of <UNK>
<START> don't get me wrong i assumed this movie would be stupid i honestly did i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going different story for a different time as i began watching i noticed something this film was terrible now there are two types of terrible there's freddy vs jason terrible where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is and then there is a movie like this the cat in the hat failed to create even a <UNK> interest in me as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless but i felt as though i had in some way been <UNK> by the <UNK> of said movie mike myers is usually brilliant i love the majority of his work but something in this movie didn't click one of the things that the director producers writers <UNK> changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book red black white on any character but the cat <UNK> or not they also refused to capture any of the original and i hate to use this word but it fits <UNK> of the original the book was like an ice cream sunday colorful and delicious and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as <UNK> br br avoid this like a <UNK> prostitute
<START> usually alan <UNK> plays characters that are too soft and overly verbal it's probably how he really lives this time he fits the character though he overacts when the verdict is being delivered br br the 1971 prison riot and the state of new <UNK> response is remembered by many of us as a terrifying event only a few <UNK> have told the true story this film provides a quick look at the horrors and <UNK> associated with the riot revolt had a major impact on this country maybe the movie will <UNK> someone to research the history br br i can't remember a feature movie made from the perspective of the prisoners though there is a great <UNK> piece with the actual survivors participants the perspective of the guards held hostage is explored in against the wall with kyle <UNK> samuel l jackson clarence williams iii and <UNK> forrest br br back in the day we <UNK> it was nice to hear it in the movie brought back memories br br the worst part of the movie are the natural <UNK> morris <UNK> and the other african americans must wear it would have been easy for these people to grow a <UNK>
<START> great film a very worthy 7 10 br br tom hanks was at his usual best the heavy drinking <UNK> who saved afghanistan from its communist <UNK> based upon a true story tells us how the west throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away well it did go away albeit <UNK> look who we the british amongst others are now fighting the very same people who the us gave arms training and money to in the 80s br br this film was always going to <UNK> political thoughts by the people who watch it but it does portray a very nice story however once the main objective is achieved i e <UNK> the <UNK> from afghanistan it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about br br this film was good it was a well deserved 7 10 it told the story of the communist invasion of afghanistan and the subsequent <UNK> operation by the us to some detail and was <UNK> well although being a good film i will recommend it to people but some people will not enjoy it particularly is a serious film about good us v evil russia isn't your thing
<START> yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie my knowledge of the plot was limited to about 60 seconds of the trailer but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase br br as i saw the movie those <UNK> pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing with some apparently inexplicable details but in the end everything is <UNK> as a simple succession of events of bad luck <UNK> <UNK> in portuguese above everything i felt that the story made sense and everything fits in it's place <UNK> of a good script br br i must also mention the soundtrack which helps the creation of an amazing environment br br and if you think of the resources <UNK> <UNK> used to make this film i believe it will make many hollywood producers <UNK>
<START> it didn't take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity as early as 1983 the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by <UNK> the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the <UNK> boy of horror cinema by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a <UNK> direction which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in <UNK> most of them were <UNK> produced and taken as a whole they were <UNK> unappealing with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the <UNK> scott <UNK> intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and <UNK> william <UNK> maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and <UNK> proved to be the last <UNK> <UNK> of life in the <UNK> category br br it was the <UNK> release of schlock like <UNK> blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity it finally took the big budgeted <UNK> of wes craven's scream to provide the necessary <UNK> having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits <UNK> beside <UNK> and camping del <UNK> as another welcome addition to the native american influenced <UNK> br br a truck pulls up on a <UNK> road and out step two laughably <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace next we meet a <UNK> of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun target practice on some of the local <UNK> the area is owned by neil <UNK> and has been passed down through three generations of his family his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was <UNK> to have left a curse on the property according to legend every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest <UNK> revenge on those he <UNK> responsible for the <UNK> of the <UNK> home it wouldn't be much fun if those <UNK> were a <UNK> so regular as clockwork a <UNK> assassin turns up with a taste for blood will the kids be able to stop this phantom br br demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted but still woefully cheap re <UNK> of fred <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a sequence to confirm my <UNK> things start <UNK> with some crisp friday the 13th style first person cinematography and a couple of shock <UNK> that were composed with <UNK> by director frank <UNK> thomas did a good job with the photography and the <UNK> drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late eighties <UNK> rubbish <UNK> of suspense are <UNK> with a couple of credible directorial <UNK> and there are even a few attempts at humour the killer looked successfully creepy in demon <UNK> and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a <UNK> touch from the director br br fred <UNK> <UNK> notorious slasher was notable for its stark and <UNK> unsettling atmosphere unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately <UNK> <UNK> has it that the majority of the actors were <UNK> from the texas university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature so of course it goes without saying that the <UNK> are appropriately abysmal i especially enjoyed the hilarious john  an native american don't ask that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him warrior started with some credible glimpses of <UNK> from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher <UNK> unfortunately the <UNK> cocktail of <UNK> acting and an ending <UNK> directly from seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating it's a shame that the <UNK> were so <UNK> from the bottom of the <UNK> barrel because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential br br all in all movie is a mixed bag of ideas  some of them were good but mostly they were <UNK> mediocre because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the happy censors there's really no gore worth mentioning even the sequence is relatively tame compared to <UNK> <UNK> graphic depiction demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility but not often enough to warrant a purchase not as bad as the aforementioned <UNK> blood lake et al but not really that good
<START> few people realize it but there was world literature in the ancient world before the <UNK> came on the scene besides the literary remains that are in the old testament of the jews there were considerable works from <UNK> and egypt the <UNK> of the former were the religious poetry and the epic of <UNK> the <UNK> produced many <UNK> but there main addition was a tale of adventure of a <UNK> and <UNK> called the story of it is from this work actually a <UNK> that we don't know the ending of that the novel the egyptian came from br br the story is unique as is the movie the egyptian was a best <UNK> in the early 1950s and <UNK> <UNK> decided to take a chance making it yes he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend <UNK> as as well as the rest of the cast victor mature edmund <UNK> peter ustinov michael <UNK> and gene tierney but he was aware that these films rarely made large box office one can <UNK> up this as an example of <UNK> trying something different br br the number of movies that deal with ancient egypt are very small land of the the egyptian the ten <UNK> both de <UNK> versions <UNK> holy <UNK> <UNK> the mummy all versions the <UNK> king if there are 20 films about ancient egypt it's is tremendous but the egyptian is unique while the second ten <UNK> <UNK> the great <UNK> ii <UNK> <UNK> and his father <UNK> i cedric <UNK> and the films on <UNK> deal with her few other names of ancient egypt crop up in film greatest <UNK> was iii who <UNK> most of the known middle east of the era of b c e or so no film about him has appeared nor of his <UNK> predecessor <UNK> first great female <UNK> but the only known <UNK> who attempted a religious revolution that approached what the jews and later the christians attempted a type of <UNK> is the subject of the egyptian this is <UNK> br br in reality was practicing a personal form of <UNK> that was not meant for public <UNK> but it <UNK> the <UNK> class who <UNK> rather than due to our uncertain historic records although official records the tel el letters are quite complete as far as they survive we do not know if the <UNK> was killed in a palace coup or not however he died he was succeeded by a young brother or son of his whose name is better <UNK> than any other <UNK> except br br this film is actually quite good as far as it goes <UNK> makes a good natured who is too weak to be as effective as a religious <UNK> is supposed to be mature is good as the ambitious and outside the film ultimately successful future <UNK> tierney and <UNK> do well in their lead parts and ustinov is good as friend also good is ms in a large supporting part in a wonderful cameo is john <UNK> as a philosophical grave <UNK> the film is certainly worthy of viewing as one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient egypt
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness based on the mega best <UNK> from author the film provides us a peak at the <UNK> of post russia <UNK> afghanistan and the terror of the <UNK> director marc foster adds a gem to his resume which already includes <UNK> ball finding <UNK> and stranger than fiction br br the story of young friends <UNK> and <UNK> and the unknown bond they share into the next generation this is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual coming of age tale some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of truly amazing scenes as <UNK> returns as an adult to find <UNK> imprisoned son br br this is tight compelling story telling with a message the acting is solid throughout with no one actor stealing the screen although not a pleasant story to watch unfold it is certainly meaningful and heart felt plus a quick shot of midnight oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift
<START> i really liked get <UNK> but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel first of all travolta does not in any way resemble the <UNK> <UNK> from get <UNK> he merely half <UNK> this performance as he has done in all of his more recent movies he totally isn't smooth or have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie it just seems like travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good to go for acting in this movie the plot just wasn't exciting or clever there really aren't any highlights that happen the only thing that <UNK> entertainment was watching christina perform and the rock was funny but anyways long story short this movie was trash and i had to force myself just to get through it
<START> this movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and <UNK> patriotic sense of pride in america the nazi <UNK> of the 40's are replaced by the middle east terrorists of today the intent is the same to <UNK> <UNK> lives destroy property and kill americans we see a wrongly accused barry bob <UNK> on the <UNK> trying to <UNK> the real nazi terrorists plot meeting the beautiful pat <UNK> lane and together they travel to new york chasing the <UNK> and evil <UNK> <UNK> played expertly by norman lloyd along the way they encounter the also very sinister otto <UNK> playing the leader of the nazi <UNK> ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen where barry seeking <UNK> <UNK> takes him into his confidence only to handed over to the local law <UNK> he escapes meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece enter <UNK> lane from there barry and pat travel to <UNK> city cal run into the west coast <UNK> gang heading east they trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely new york <UNK> the going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap pat from barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon the movie climax is the famous statue of liberty scene which is <UNK> in many <UNK> this is a true blue patriotic flag waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that see this movie if you don't see another hitchcock film you will be swept up in the patriotic and the love interest between <UNK> and lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies she is the beautiful ideal girl next door often underrated her talent shows through in this film see it and go bless america
<START> as a kid i loved the song never smile at a crocodile and if i found myself in this state of affairs which is actually inspired by true events smiling would be the last thing on my mind from the opening set up i've never been so <UNK> caught up and finally exhausted like i was when watching this limited budget independent australian horror film about three people in northern territory trapped in a swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them what really brought the film alive was how realistic it managed to be in <UNK> the fear and <UNK> of the characters' situation to the audience semi documentary camera work with a eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone what we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody all out creature feature <UNK> think of open water 2003 where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay low key but this minimal <UNK> enhanced the experience br br the slow <UNK> story might be black and white but it never seemed to become <UNK> or <UNK> to formulaic <UNK> well not largely and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare straight forward script although you can say less is more with the actions and expressions <UNK> the lingering thoughts <UNK> their minds the ordeal is utterly terrifying because the threat is very alive and never seems to <UNK> up this is what drives the film's chaotic <UNK> and in which it lasts even when its kept buried through to the very end br br writers directors andrew and david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits in certain <UNK> the notch goes up with pressure induced suspense and startling images the way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and <UNK> the menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh meat in a <UNK> suspenseful approach sure some moments felt unlikely but never does it get in the way or distract sound fx is the key and at times the lack of any just eats away at you <UNK> musical score is <UNK> and doesn't really enter the mixture much but when it does it builds an <UNK> sounding quality the cinematography of john is beautifully <UNK> and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes it was always on the move and claustrophobic but none of this jerky movements the editing was <UNK> handled and the effects were <UNK> <UNK> by superbly <UNK> live crocodile footage br br something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it diana glenn andy and especially are <UNK> good a lot of the responsibility falls on and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film rogue 2007 but the two couldn't be any different in what they want to be and how they end up if i had to pick though i'm <UNK> more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you br br a remarkable effort on all <UNK> with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for
<START> i liked this show from the first episode i saw which was the <UNK> in blue episode for those that don't know what that is the <UNK> going insane and becoming 10 <UNK> best visuals and special effects i've seen on a television series nothing like it anywhere
<START> the only <UNK> in this film was how it ever got made the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get money <UNK> bbc to keep in their life style they have been <UNK> to with doing nothing for it br br the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt gangsters or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> types the story script was just <UNK> weak to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the <UNK> theme i just expected it the whole film was a happy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rip off br br the priceless <UNK> i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street <UNK> wouldn't carry around in my breast pocket every where to the beach and fights etc saying that <UNK> jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film poor bloke br br when derek <UNK> walked into the water at the end because he was dickens oh my god what a load of crap and i am being positive here
<START> written by science fiction veterans <UNK> and sylvia anderson this space fantasy is <UNK> directed by robert <UNK> experienced american astronaut colonel glenn ross roy <UNK> agrees to a <UNK> flight to the far side of the sun the mission is to be controlled by jason <UNK> patrick and his euro <UNK> space agency scientist john kane ian <UNK> will <UNK> ross the two will explore a newly discovered planet that is in the same identical <UNK> as earth except it is always hidden on the other side of the sun ross is the only one to make it back to earth and has a very incredible story to tell special effects may be better than the story line nonetheless fun to watch the cast also includes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> von george <UNK> and herbert <UNK>
<START> this is one of the very best films i've seen in ages it's right up there with the likes of <UNK> and pulp fiction it just <UNK> teenage culture today the soundtrack is absolutely amazing <UNK> by pete <UNK> it's a must see
<START> with batman returns tim burton <UNK> to an important <UNK> in american cinema giving a sequel to a blockbuster three years after the most successful movie of the year batman 1989 here comes the hero of <UNK> city again for the pleasure of many <UNK> like its predecessor batman returns enjoyed an enormous commercial success tim burton made batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the joker did little to improve the image of <UNK> city indeed violence and corruption still exist and here the second word is <UNK> by max christopher walken and the penguin danny de <UNK> these two crooks who are eager to take control of <UNK> city are going to make life difficult for batman his task will be more difficult with the <UNK> of <UNK> br br tim burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie it means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better <UNK> than in the first batman but he didn't neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that if in the movie of 1989 burton had focused on bruce wayne <UNK> psychology here it's the penguin that obviously interested him the director attempted to make of him very well acted by de <UNK> an ambiguous character on one hand he's full of bad intentions previously <UNK> but on the other hand he's searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man br br batman returns also appears as <UNK> than its predecessor especially with the cast i think of <UNK> pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as <UNK> besides at the time when i'm writing this review it makes me remember that a new version of <UNK> is currently at the cinema but given the bad reviews 3 out of 10 on imdb it is sure that her performer <UNK> <UNK> must pale into <UNK> beside pfeiffer br br ultimately this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and it <UNK> to develop tim <UNK> peculiar style we also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic concerning <UNK> other adaptations for the screen you can skip them batman forever 1995 and batman and robin 1997 are no good i heard that christopher nolan was shooting the beginning of the batman story and it was to be released next year will it match tim <UNK> works
<START> this is a classic that will be able to hold up with <UNK> to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70's style and it's a story about the 70's it is funny action filled entertaining and sad at the same time it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions 4 stars
<START> it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah <UNK> cinematography and adam film editing and above all no sense of what goes on in mexico city the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city but it is unable to do it it is a shame a lot of film wasted an american woman tries to find her brother who has been the first account of the story is powerful and interesting very realistic but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us <UNK> <UNK> in mexico city when dealing with an issue like this one compare as an example with frantic 1988 which deals with a similar issue something similar can be said of the role of local authorities compare as an example with <UNK> el <UNK> 1999 the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself paying little or no attention to the rather weak plot and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief who is going to believe that a mexican <UNK> from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico us border and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city only the producers of this movie it is worth mentioning that unlike <UNK> and other movies about mexico at least in these one <UNK> talk spanish
<START> i saw the short titled the reader recently and found that the movie was well planned and executed i really felt for both characters that morgan and elizabeth <UNK> portray in this film elizabeth was able to show great range with her blind character and left me feeling emotionally connected morgan was able to sell to me that she was totally committed in keeping sissy or <UNK> <UNK> from the grief of losing her sister who had been living in <UNK> the great thing about the film was in the short running time and budget of only ten thousand dollars <UNK> <UNK> was able to make a very well made film that kept the interest of the viewer <UNK> has a great insight into the actor's ability and transition great camera angles to showcase their talent i always feel if a director can make a great film with a small budget then what can he or she do with a much larger one great job <UNK>
<START> this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid movie i wanted a <UNK> this was a bad series to the puppet master and i'm sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible to some it was great but to others it was a ticket to <UNK> and boy are they right the puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people it <UNK> be seen by people so i'm warning you not to see it you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money nobody even got kill but one or two very pointless br br 1 10
<START> spoilers spoilers here on earth 2000 1 2 out of four br br mark here on earth holds the record for a movie containing the most recycled material in <UNK> minutes literally every <UNK> cliché and familiar plot element are somewhere in here there is simply nothing unique original or fresh about it god what an <UNK> motion picture to sit through i wish i saw the film during its theatrical release last year so it could have earned on my year's worst list this is the kind of movie where the story makes itself instantly obvious and goes downhill from the opening credits and worst of all takes itself seriously here on earth is clearly one of the most horrible painful movies to come down the <UNK> in some time br br here on earth is a teen <UNK> film so it must contain some of hollywood's most <UNK> young men who are attractive and inexperienced enough to accept a role in a movie as bad as this chris <UNK> and josh <UNK> fit that <UNK> description and take the lead roles by storm <UNK> plays <UNK> an arrogant and <UNK> student with a wealthy father cliché number one he is to graduate as the <UNK> and attend <UNK> league college following in the footsteps of his father stuart wilson this sets up the i don't want your life cliché in which the father tries to control his son's life while the son <UNK> <UNK> throw in deceased mother who committed suicide a while back when his father brings home another woman he brutally questions his intentions the no one can replace mom cliché counts as number two br br josh <UNK> plays <UNK> a character on the opposite side of society to <UNK> his family owns a local diner enter his long time love interest samantha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a waitress at the diner who covers for her sister who has no purpose whatsoever rather than controlling the following scene when <UNK> and <UNK> act like childish morons by racing their cars and oh no crashing into the diner causing it to <UNK> into flames conflicts between the rich and poor will count as cliché number three br br the <UNK> car chase sets both <UNK> and <UNK> up for a contrived and plausible conflict they get in trouble with the law but because this movie feels the need to exist the local judge orders them an alternative to serving time they must work together to help <UNK> the diner br br the two boys work hard during the summer growing strong and getting a nice <UNK> <UNK> eye catches <UNK> and romantic sparks fly <UNK> is jealous but wants what is best for his true love cliché number four her parents <UNK> o'toole and bruce <UNK> <UNK> of her little romantic triangle cliché number five but she continues two timing <UNK> without a second thought her father also happens to be the local sheriff how surprising lets count that melodramatic <UNK> cliché number six br br the contrived romantic feelings between <UNK> and samantha count as cliché number seven but <UNK> relationship with <UNK> is never defined so how can there any romantic tension if the film is going to <UNK> involvement in <UNK> choice between the two young men then we need to see both characters from both sides the movie depicts <UNK> as a distraction to her <UNK> love <UNK> it's clear <UNK> truly loves her but it is also clear she does not love him back this absolutely <UNK> the romantic tension early in the story br br <UNK> <UNK> does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a two timing character like samantha john <UNK> is also right for the role of <UNK> but the movie gives him nothing to do except <UNK> with <UNK> chris <UNK> gets to make a hunk name for himself here he spends much of the movie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> unfortunately he does not show off his acting ability maybe because he has very little the supporting cast is much more talented bruce <UNK> supplies the best performance in the film but does not have near enough screen time to save anything but a few brief moments i also enjoyed the performance by stuart wilson who perfectly fits the role of a rich controlling father of high social status br br then we lean about <UNK> <UNK> problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie another spoiler ahead what is this she has a serious <UNK> illness yet another <UNK> into the picture approximately number eight her <UNK> disease brings the two competing young men together as friends well at least i think that is what the movie intended to show that the loss of one loved by two <UNK> can bring both together cliché number nine br br <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> speech to demonstrate his character is more than a shallow stereotype but we have seen this so many times before i would prefer a rich character rather than a deeply sentimental who hides actual feelings cliché number um was it ten the conflicts between <UNK> and <UNK> are desperate and inane a your mom comment <UNK> a fist fight while they <UNK> the establishment there is a <UNK> from <UNK> as samantha and <UNK> <UNK> out in an open field horny as hell as he slowly moves his fingers around her body <UNK> areas after us cities why not call that number eleven the movie uses alcohol as a means to increase the romantic tension an <UNK> <UNK> makes a fool of himself after getting in a fight with <UNK> date <UNK> but the following day he <UNK> desires only to dance cliché number oh no i am losing count
<START> during the brief period between clint eastwood's string of spaghetti westerns and his dirty harry films he and director don <UNK> teamed up to make this unusual picture eastwood plays an injured union army <UNK> during the civil war who is taken in by a southern school for girls until he <UNK> from his wounds it has been a while since the young women most of which seem to be teenagers have had a man on the premises so they are reluctant to turn him in to the local rebel soldiers the resulting situations are often humorous shocking erotic or even downright grotesque as eastwood slowly <UNK> his strength and begins to <UNK> over the establishment br br the basic storyline almost sounds like the <UNK> of a porno film we have a <UNK> male suddenly surrounded by young <UNK> women most of them are sexually attracted to him and he is more than willing to spread the love amongst them the material never really slips down to the level of tasteless however eastwood <UNK> and cinematographer bruce <UNK> are such skilled filmmakers that the film always <UNK> its dignity br br eastwood's john is like no other character he has ever played is an amoral conniving and <UNK> <UNK> he knows that most of the women even the youngest want his <UNK> and he lets more than one of them have a shot at him often uses <UNK> to <UNK> the women up then uses his rugged good looks to reel them in he is like a drunken player at a cocktail party often hitting on different women even in the same scene eventually his <UNK> ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you must see for yourselves this author would not dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions but there is little doubt he has them coming br br eastwood gives a typically great performance he seems to be having a blast with the role until things turn really ugly then he turns mean and ugly <UNK> page is a treat as the <UNK> b <UNK> who runs the school we know she wants as much as the other girls but with her <UNK> past shown to us in flashbacks we find out that isn't all she's after mae <UNK> as a slave <UNK> to the school gives a great performance too she obviously knows is a <UNK> from the beginning and she never lets his phony charm bring her guard down this is a character you will want to know more about after the film is over she seems to have a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film br br the <UNK> did poorly in its theatrical release nobody was quite sure what to make of it and some of its content no doubt raised a few <UNK> in 1971 for example in an early scene we see eastwood <UNK> kiss a 12 <UNK> old girl is he just trying to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close or is he really enjoying it probably both a fantasy sequence later on even shows clint getting it on with not only page but her young assistant truly some interesting goings on in this one it's a good thing eastwood became the star he did or this one might have been long forgotten br br highly recommended 9 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> the creature yeah it and the movie it stars in hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to the shadowy world from which it came other than having major logic and <UNK> problems plus the fact it appears to be unfinished this disaster is terribly acted written edited by j r and directed and the make up fx are almost nonexistent it's also significantly shorter than it claims at only 80 minutes but i'm not complaining it's the worst movie i've seen from executive producer charles <UNK> full moon productions and boy is that bad br br to note i almost didn't bother with a review but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order proceed with caution
<START> best thing i can say about this porno horror film is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br beyond that this film is made by some <UNK> indian guy with some background in porn films or such br br plot talk show host and girlfriend are stalked by a psychopath who is angry over the plight of the homeless and takes it out on you guessed it beautiful real estate agent ladies films like these are why the slasher films of the 80's got a <UNK> for <UNK> br br this film is not really a slasher but has the same sort of <UNK> and stereotypes the dumb ass cops the villain is an old white male and the women are <UNK> babes br br if you like porno horror this is your movie otherwise stay away <UNK> fans will get to see her <UNK> breasts for a second or two
<START> although its plot is taken from the history of ancient rome is not made in the style of sword and <UNK> epics like or that style of movie making was out of favour in the late seventies rather it more closely resembles a cross between a soft core porn movie and a video nasty at least the <UNK> 150 minute version does i have never seen the full <UNK> minute version but to judge from the <UNK> of it on this page it would seem closer to a cross between a hard core porn movie and a video nasty br br as one would expect from a film produced by the <UNK> of there is much naked flesh to be seen and the film lovingly <UNK> <UNK> sexual <UNK> including his incestuous affair with his sister <UNK> what is perhaps unexpected from the <UNK> of a magazine so closely associated with the <UNK> male lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as female on display and distinctly <UNK> overtones to many scenes the obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence as though bob gore <UNK> and <UNK> were trying to kill two <UNK> with one stone it is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a <UNK> film should be called and the scriptwriter of such a gory one should be called <UNK> characters are put to death or <UNK> in a variety of sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape br br the emperor <UNK> and his predecessor were certainly known for their <UNK> <UNK> so the film's concentration on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate i do however question whether such a concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in roman history both 'the fall of the roman <UNK> and were set during the reign of <UNK> an emperor quite as cruel and <UNK> as <UNK> in neither case did the filmmakers find it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of ' <UNK> and 'the texas chainsaw <UNK> and both those films are artistically far better than br br the acting in the film is not particularly bad with a few exceptions such as the horribly wooden <UNK> ann as <UNK> malcolm mcdowell makes a suitably insane <UNK> suitable that is in the context of this film the real <UNK> was <UNK> both cruel and eccentric but historians have <UNK> whether he was actually mentally ill the great mystery is exactly why so many distinguished british actors should have agreed to take part in such a trashy production in the case of helen <UNK> the only dame of the british empire with a past as a porn star it was probably connected to her rather <UNK> tendency to alternate between the <UNK> and the sleazy but heaven alone knows what peter o'toole and john gielgud thought they were doing unlike some other famous stage actors such as laurence olivier and richard burton gielgud did not always look completely at home in the cinema but here he gives a <UNK> interpretation of the role of a decent and <UNK> senator of the old school unfortunately in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is as out of place as a pearl on a br br clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of <UNK> whether <UNK> and <UNK> had quite the same ambition for the film is open to question the film does not however succeed upon any other level either as art cinema or as a study of the politics of <UNK> even seen as <UNK> it is second rate 4 10
<START> what game over <UNK> and the machine does best is to delve into <UNK> psyche during the 1997 competition against deep blue you see him becoming more and more paranoid and increasingly <UNK> all because in the second game deep blue made a move that seemed too human for his <UNK> notion of chess computers <UNK> thought then and still does that <UNK> cheated br br game over tries to seem <UNK> but it is clear that the director thinks that <UNK> cheated however they give no real evidence to support the cheating claim only that security surrounding the computer room was because <UNK> really had <UNK> hidden in there <UNK> the computer on certain key occasions and <UNK> that the computer didn't play like a computer usually does at one point in game two in game two <UNK> played a game that was designed to trick the computer attempting to sacrifice a <UNK> in a situation where previous computer chess programs would have taken the <UNK> leading to the eventual loss deep blue didn't take the bait and <UNK> was so <UNK> because the computer seemed to play like a human that he didn't even see that he could have played deep blue to a draw and ended up <UNK> that game <UNK> him out so much that he was unable to recover and after playing games 3 4 and 5 to draws lost game 6 horribly br br the question of whether <UNK> cheated all comes down to that single move in game two where the deep blue made the move that any human would make but that had up to that point <UNK> up computers joel benjamin a chess <UNK> on programming team explained in the documentary that they knew that chess computers always got <UNK> up in that situation and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming deep blue so that it wouldn't make the mistake that other computers do if you believe <UNK> <UNK> then the case is clear <UNK> did not cheat unfortunately the director quickly moved on and never mentioned explanation for the rest of the movie <UNK> to cut between shots of the chess playing <UNK> of the 19th century the and shots of deep blue <UNK> that deep blue was really controlled by a human as well as someone who has an understanding of programming the explanation by <UNK> makes perfect sense if you knew what you were doing it would not be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that if thus and so conditions are reached then do thus and so in other words tell the computer what to do if a situation like the one that <UNK> created in game 2 ever happened this isn't cheating it's doing a good job of programming a chess computer br br in the end it's <UNK> clear that the director thinks that <UNK> cheated and the repeated comments about stock rising 15 the day that deep blue won suggest the idea that <UNK> cheated to <UNK> its stock price <UNK> even <UNK> <UNK> and deep blue to <UNK> however there is plenty of outside opinion within both the chess and computer science <UNK> that deep blue won fair and square and that <UNK> lost because he simply couldn't get past his view of computers as dumb machines and got <UNK> out by a machine that didn't seem so dumb after all i just wish that the director had let us see the alternative opinion br br
<START> a young woman <UNK> t n t for being virtual dynamite in a fight and a <UNK> in terms of looks to boot goes to the most <UNK> part of hong kong in search of her missing brother <UNK> jackson when she learns he has been murdered she decides she will bring the killer to justice in a fashion only she can br br sounds good doesn't it well there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as a starting base for a martial arts <UNK> action thriller which is what this aims to be the leads actually prove pretty good too with <UNK> bell fitting nicely into the role of t n t and stan shaw doing well as the ambitious power hungry charlie where this fails miserably is in terms of the fighting action it offers up the fight scenes are totally and completely unconvincing and or sometimes so completely over the top it reaches the point of <UNK> which doesn't at all help when the basic focus of your movie is a kung fu action heroine also the poor lighting actors sporting accents making them hard to understand the confusing camera work and the sometimes poor sound doesn't help this obvious low budget effort out either any this does deliver in one area which may delight some fans it does offer up plenty of the t in t a in fact practically every fight scene in the film is <UNK> by some type of nude scene and <UNK> bell actually does have one extended fight scene in which she is completely topless br br in the end this fails to be something you want to <UNK> because the fight scenes are so <UNK> <UNK> bad
<START> for those of you who have a few kind words for this film i suspect you didn't see it when it was released as parts the horror br br it was a dreadfully boring movie it missed the mark in at least three ways it wasn't good enough to be scary it wasn't bad enough to be funny although mst3k took care of that and even in 1979 the plot was unoriginal br br earlier <UNK> are the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> 1971 it's the same idea <UNK> as spare parts the movie is entertaining and it had a fine cast another is sleeper 1973 yes the woody allen movie remember the <UNK> nose and <UNK> 1973 the last two plots aren't as similar to as the first one but they <UNK> br br they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea although often the word clone isn't used
<START> stanley stupid tom arnold and his wife joan like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the <UNK> they have two equally challenged children buster and <UNK> one day mr stupid notices their garbage is gone again there must be someone stealing it from the <UNK> he goes off in roller <UNK> after the garbage truck when he finally gets to the dump he is <UNK> to learn not only that other folks garbage has been stolen too but that there is a secret organization meeting at the <UNK> he is determined to defeat the garbage of the world it seems meanwhile <UNK> and buster visit the police station and a chinese restaurant in search of their parents for joan comes up missing too will they <UNK> their way through their problems this is just a stupid stupid movie with the <UNK> being the terrible script the books by and marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from the books ends up in this film arnold is actually quite nice as mr stupid and the other cast members try very very hard to make the film work the production values are very high with the dog and cat <UNK> to the adding a little <UNK> to the film but it is all for <UNK> as the plot is wandering and weak perhaps someday someone will take another stab at <UNK> the very funny books to the big screen therefore if you love to laugh rent something else while you <UNK> a new production and by all means go get the books too but stay away from being stupid yourself as anyone who watches this movie to the end could hardly be called intelligent
<START> as i stated earlier this year in my review of <UNK> which was scripted by this films writer director producer skip woods this is a good film it ranks very high up there in my crime flick list among lock stock two smoking <UNK> pulp fiction and snatch basically i think this film is for me what <UNK> dogs was for many people a cult classic although i prefer to compare it with pulp fiction i mean i never liked <UNK> first effort a lot but i sure as hell liked this one as much as i like pulp fiction for it simply has everything a classic needs a great story and good actors ok the budget might be not as big as in for instance godzilla the <UNK> of mission to mars but it sure as hell beats the living crap out of those films and numerous others br br the story of this film is about a man named <UNK> thomas jane who has settled down with his wife in <UNK> unexpectedly an old friend of his comes by <UNK> his life revealing his secrets and basically making his day a living hell and a bloody one too br br the film is very original and quite bloody sexually <UNK> so based on that first and that last quality i can assure you that if you like this film you'll also like <UNK> which of course has a much bigger budget and more famous faces than this one but is just as good though not as bloody and not quite as sexually <UNK> i saw this film for the second time last night and i really enjoyed it again i mean all the characters and actors are good although i must give very big credits to thomas jane and who were the best actors and had the best characters in the film also i'd have to thank skip woods for being so imaginative and original brutal sexual offensive maybe but sure as heck enjoyable and a thrill ride to the end br br 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> to watch this trash and pay for it with hard earned cash <UNK> no hint of laughter god knows how it won a <UNK> br br we've now been subjected to <UNK> for twenty years when oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is crass <UNK> this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in <UNK> and never has done br br the <UNK> i know the real ones are kind courageous <UNK> and loyal and one of their greatest attributes is humour it was the <UNK> who went through the worst of the london <UNK> and still stuck two fingers up to hitler and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week including an <UNK> nothing but a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> dead from the neck up <UNK> who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day <UNK> at each other what a great <UNK> for britain that is do the writers actually believe this garbage they're <UNK> out obviously the <UNK> minded section of the public does but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be <UNK> into believing anything
<START> it's a bit difficult to believe that this came from the same director that gave us <UNK> where's the style the foreboding and the charm i mean <UNK> is not a great horror film but at least it had something is like a large ball of bad ideas poorly executed from the opening there is a problem with subtlety the monsters are shown in the first shot the opening dream sequence shows too much for too long our hero doesn't display professional acting skills but no one expected that from this bastard genre there are killings that one wishes were more interesting then we have david <UNK> the man was never really meant to be an actor he fills the role of the creepy psychiatrist adequately but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster then we come to a creepy fake graveyard with an over creepy fake gate this thing is not a huge improvement over the cemetery in plan 9 from outer space it gets worse when we meet the creatures in it there is nothing really wrong with the character design and make up effects here well except for the guy with no <UNK> the guy with a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes the problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue that is given them <UNK> photography of the <UNK> city is tired and this part of the story could have been made much better some might call what follows spoilers after our hero dies and becomes we wait around to see what he'll turn into there's talk of things that fly and werewolves but when the time comes for him to change they <UNK> thought their hero too pretty to give a decent creature design with the turn in <UNK> character the story just gets less interesting until the battle of freaks vs <UNK> which is just bad <UNK> mythology failed him here there is no genius and little originality behind any of the picture could have used a larger budget a serious script and character design that doesn't leave you saying oh oh how lame what a waste not scary not cool not even very dark just weak
<START> when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work i love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones but this takes the cake the plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring i don't mean to keep <UNK> the script and plot because believe me that is not the worst part i have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors and i was impressed with taylor locke this being one of his first movies the worst part of the movie was the special effects they <UNK> of low budget and really ruined the viewers entertainment even if he had been remotely interested in the plot i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors
<START> for years i <UNK> watching this movie now i know why not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but there's also just nothing to laugh at about the movie it was even worse than i'd expected i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie i have used imdb for some time but felt <UNK> to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this stinker really a waste of time and money i must say that the plot line is awful
<START> bronson and ireland in their last film together make a likable pair he is more restrained than usual and she has become a winning actress but as a thriller the film is totally worthless its premise is downright silly and its pace is much too rushed
<START> a ridiculous comedy given an arms <UNK> direction i love one of the comments here couldn't be made today well neither could the philadelphia story without a car chase or two nonetheless does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old fashioned i don't think susan slept here was good for any generation and it should <UNK> <UNK> in the memories of debbie reynolds buffs there is no <UNK> in this story of a screenwriter who <UNK> onto a much younger girl for dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him reynolds is <UNK> produced by one harriet parsons who gives her famous mother <UNK> a number of inane <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> this film would be a great piece of history if in fact it was a real film of the kennedy assassination the are far too many mistakes in this film for me to point out it is a film of the kennedy assassination but many of the important facts have been altered there are missing scenes and many of the scenes after the <UNK> <UNK> passes the sign don't fit in both <UNK> move <UNK> slower then the other four people in front of them next time you watch this film look for things that don't add up such as the texas <UNK> and his along with the ss men in the front <UNK> forward but you can see that the <UNK> is not stopping or <UNK> down in fact is is <UNK> this film is clearly an attempt at a cover up
<START> this is one of the best looking films of the past few years the fact that it was done on a virtual <UNK> 1 8 million or so they say on the dvd they <UNK> that they ended up with even less <UNK> makes it all the more impressive not simply the photography but the design and particularly the locations eastern montana which are at once <UNK> american and <UNK> br br too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it an extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of <UNK> out a rural town in 1955 before it will be <UNK> for a <UNK> is washed away with pretentious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to angels and a dying child and what is presented as the real world is hopelessly arch note to the polish brothers the <UNK> brothers are funny you are not br br no doubt many <UNK> will find <UNK> 's <UNK> symbolism and as marks of some sort of <UNK> the sort that sophisticated types <UNK> the night away with in while the <UNK> masses watch charlie's angels or something sigh if you insist br br in the meantime recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and <UNK> beauty
<START> first i rated this movie 10 10 to me it's simply one of the best i saw since i was born i'm 23 but i saw numerous films the story is cruel but reality is too not it went deep into me and <UNK> my <UNK> i saw it about 5 or 6 years ago and it still shakes me and i still remember it br br second there is no <UNK> this expression is a direct translation from the french for this movie i mean it's not because it is a french movie that i put it so high it has really caught me when i saw it furthermore i don't know well marcel <UNK> filmography so i don't know if it is or not his best movie but i know it is not his most famous hotel du <UNK> <UNK> des <UNK> and les <UNK> du <UNK> are the most famous br br third the movie's in b w but it deals with inter <UNK> problems of youth not <UNK> like love friends and studies in a modern way it could even be remade frame by frame with actual young actors a <UNK> <UNK> sound and special effects a car crash it would still be a great film br br problem maybe is it a film to be seen by young adults from 16 to 25 years old and above of course for its message to be well understood did i say it was a great movie
<START> i can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that i walked out the <UNK> and the island were both so bad that i thought about it but i even stayed to the end in those this movie was incomprehensible not funny and just went on and on and on like some other <UNK> i wondered if parts were just french humor that i didn't get or if the characters were serious i finally just gave up and tried <UNK> because i didn't want to <UNK> my husband if he was enjoying it but he noticed and let me know that it was okay if i wanted to leave and out the door we went he would like to know how it ended if lived or died etc i don't even care
<START> there are moments when you don't want those deep drama series when you don't want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series with lots of action and cool characters for those moments you have <UNK> br br i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie's angels critics said it was to superficial and silly but the thing is that's the point people who can't relax and expected a serious movie hated it it's exactly the same with <UNK> it is superficial it has silly and unrealistic characters and that's why i like it it isn't like any other series br br the first season wasn't very good the character <UNK> was irritating and a little too much the story was a little lame and you didn't get to know the characters very much but hey they only had 20 minutes in every episode br br in the last 5 6 episodes of <UNK> they finally gave the series full 40 minutes length and it was here i started to love it the series finally started to grow into a very <UNK> series too bad they had to <UNK> the series because the last episodes of <UNK> actually was very good i will never forget <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> unique characters that only the creators of <UNK> could have created
<START> the according to this <UNK> is a mysterious br br creature that has been killing and eating hispanic <UNK> in latin br br america and mexico for years one has crossed the border into br br southern texas and a cute <UNK> no i did not br br make up that word go to an isolated ranch to find one her uncle br br was killed by the creature and some grainy video footage of the br br monster exists she takes a <UNK> black guy with a gun and two br br <UNK> for easy to edit coverage and they go for br br ten minutes into the film they find it br br the rest of the film has the team of <UNK> getting br br attacked by the <UNK> monster and stilted dialogue at one br br point the team runs into a couple of <UNK> witches who lead them br br to the nest for 100 if only the fbi knew about how br br cheaply <UNK> witches could be bought as <UNK> whole br br decades of mythical beast reports could be <UNK> up with a br br blank check br br in the end after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give a br br <UNK> <UNK> about a is captured killed and br br <UNK> the only point of the <UNK> scene is to highlight the br br makeup <UNK> efforts in such a cheap film br br the film is shot on video just like <UNK> yet the cameraman br br characters never <UNK> their tapes or their camera br br <UNK> the lead actress here is awful the beauty of the br br average <UNK> was its use of <UNK> during the production br br here all the lines are written and are delivered like a poorly br br <UNK> christmas <UNK> br br the film is <UNK> with racism as well the only african american br br here is a <UNK> gun nut at one point as the crew breaks br br into an abandoned house they find a trio of illegal immigrants who br br <UNK> ask them if they are from the ins <UNK> <UNK> br br the monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit and nothing more for br br such a <UNK> and awkward beast he is able to sneak up on br br the cast pretty quietly whether they have <UNK> locked br br themselves in a giant cage as bait or cannot seem to get their br br only vehicle started br br the gore is gruesome but when surrounded by this kind of br br stupidity it loses all of its <UNK> i do not know if this was br br shot before or after <UNK> but i can honestly say this is the worst br br film ever made in southern texas about a mythical beast pray br br there are not any sequels i will start a letter writing campaign to br br troma br br this is rated r for strong physical violence gun violence strong br br gore and profanity br br
<START> every saturday morning at 11 a m i watched <UNK> all the biggest events happened on this show at the time challenge which aired sunday <UNK> was decent too but all the big stuff happened on this show <UNK> would do all their interviews with mean gene on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own to the screen in front of a background that promoted them the matches were usually but sometimes you would see 2 mid square off in the main event there were also interview shows that usually resulted in violence thus setting up a <UNK> these segments <UNK> from <UNK> pit the body shop the flower shop the snake pit the brother love show the funeral <UNK> and the <UNK> shop i don't recall any titles changing hands on this show that usually happened at pay per views and saturday nights main event
<START> as muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best it features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great <UNK> songs and <UNK> them together in a <UNK> of the best display of <UNK> talent the story is basic and the jokes are many <UNK> in order to <UNK> both the adults and the kids to which this was <UNK> without exposing them to <UNK> their parents may not find <UNK> br br this is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic br br it rates an 8 9 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i was actually satisfied when i played this game the graphics were something new the missions were great but yet i felt i wanted more out of this game for a james bond game its pretty good but not as good as his other games it would be great if they could make a for it it would be much better then this may just be <UNK> i'm into games as resident evil dead rising and those kind of games so it could be better but it was ok to play one thing i absolutely hated about this game was she was irritating dying all the time and she couldn't run either i recommend this game for those who like <UNK> games more than i do 7 10 stars
<START> an american werewolf in paris wasn't really that good compared to the original the original didn't use computer effects for the werewolf and they looked more realistic the werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonish most of all the movie did not have enough for me for a horror film to enjoy
<START> this 1931 comedy gets better with every viewing because of the comedic talents of marion davies and a terrific performance by c <UNK> smith smith plays a gruff old man who <UNK> his grown children from his younger days as a <UNK> in his <UNK> years one is american davies one english ray <UNK> who looks about 18 and one italian nina there are some surprises as the plot moves along with ralph forbes was has no appeal at all falling for davies br br davies and smith are just wonderful together and very touching davies also gets to do a few dances and make a few big <UNK> and of course davies is just gorgeous br br <UNK> doris lloyd elizabeth murray <UNK> williams edgar norton and david <UNK> co star had they given out supporting oscar awards in 1931 smith might well have been nominated he's just excellent in this this gem
<START> wow don't watch this thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus evening it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through circus has never been more colourful more exciting and more breathtaking the whole concept is <UNK> amazing you're taken into the world of du <UNK> and are left with a thousand thoughts when you leave there's only one thing left to do get the cd and or dvd and live through it again and again and again get addicted it's well worth it must be next to the most beautiful thing on earth and one of du best <UNK>
<START> yes it's true that it was jessica alba who leads me to this movie because without her i should have never pick it br br but i find it long dull and above all unoriginal all along i thought that the story was full of clichés and the directing very boring so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person i take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies br br it's a pity because all good things were at hand <UNK> is a beautiful jungle it was the british empire and the cast is wonderful jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time she has found an appropriate movie for this bob <UNK> shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role br br the only positive thing is that it makes me open a world map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south asia you don't know where exactly ah the little plane flight with red lines in the indiana jones movie
<START> this was the third time i tried to watch this film the previous two times i found the beginning so <UNK> sweet and <UNK> that i just stopped watching however now that i am a little older and more <UNK> i forced myself to watch all the film and i was very surprised to see that i actually liked it quite a bit so i look at the movie much the same way i would look at swimming in the ocean when the water <UNK> is 70 degrees that's about 21 22 degrees for all those <UNK> lovers out there sure the water is terribly cold and shocking at first but if you force yourself to stay in the water you'll get used to it so resist that urge to jump out right away br br the film begins with a lengthy exchange between flynn and his daughter played by a <UNK> brady some may find there conversations very cute and endearing though others may find them a bit hard to take since these moments are so gosh darn sweet in a way it was some amazing acting by flynn because it's hard to imagine him in real life having kids or acting domestic especially that he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film now that's acting never say goodbye concerns the divorced couple flynn and parker and their mutual desire to <UNK> since they both love each other as well as their kid it seems like a <UNK> conclusion that they will once again tie the <UNK> however there are some serious problems standing in their way lucille watson who plays her usual over bearing and controlling mother in law character <UNK> girlfriend after all he is errol flynn and he is divorced so you gotta expect him to have a girl somewhere and a marine played by forrest tucker br br not unexpectedly all this does get worked out by the end and everyone lives happily ever after however despite it being formulaic and predictable the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch flynn despite his reputation as an action adventure hero is very good with comedy romance and it's just a lot of fun to watch him also the film has the ever scene chewing <UNK> he's just so gosh darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this type of film and despite the <UNK> the film is pretty well written the bottom line is the film is fun br br so my recommendation is that you do watch this film and force yourself not to <UNK> at the <UNK> sweet aspects of the film once you've gotten over this the rest of the film is a picture that is well worth your time
<START> this movie starts off <UNK> enough but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its <UNK> charm the set designs costumes and music were wonderful as close to perfect as one can get but the more i got into the movie the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment not the audience although i loved looking at it except for a few brief musical scenes i can't say i enjoyed it the director shows enormous imagination but if he had fun with this film he failed to share that with the audience or at least with me i didn't get a sense of <UNK> and i didn't get sucked into this universe br br a big cause of this was surprisingly zhang <UNK> you can tell she's trying very hard but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish she's a capable actress but she has her limitations i've noticed in her acting that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co stars a flaw that creates a void of chemistry the language <UNK> in this film seems to have only <UNK> matters she and <UNK> act as if they're on separate planets she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that <UNK> was ok but doesn't make much of an impression br br i didn't even care for the characters <UNK> there really is a sore lack of characterization the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good looking <UNK> without the compelling love story at the center of the film though it's hard to care what happens the film also takes <UNK> into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting i had to <UNK> because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized br br mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like the music and dance choreography are really great the supporting performances are uniformly excellent fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland
<START> so many of these types of movies out these days this zombie flick falls into the major cheese category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead and day of the dead in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them but they were also good movies a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time br br this movie had so so special effects and a very un even plot line the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to <UNK> into zombies in this one it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie yet with the ease this <UNK> <UNK> you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for <UNK> and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood br br the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were <UNK> by zombies when they were even <UNK> and were able to come out of it without a problem our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in i was laughing out load at that point <UNK> having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch ok sure br br also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military they should have watched a movie like <UNK> down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations br br one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private lol that was a good one another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors even putting his weapon down at one point these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie <UNK> special forces lol br br then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie it made no sense at all br br the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an <UNK> location giving the orders that was the best part of the movie for me
<START> the trailer to this film focused so much on the chain of course because it's so sensational that it missed most of the movie which is about a developing although rather simply drawn relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> as they attempt to recover from their past pains with each other br br of course with the premise of a <UNK> in chains it's no surprise that there's plenty of implied sex involved however at it's core black snake <UNK> is a basic tale of redemption and the healing power of helping another person along maybe it's just me though but i think poor <UNK> should've had his story focused on more he's a hurting man after his wife leaves him but we never fully see how helping <UNK> resolve her past pains <UNK> him too it's just implied that it does in essence he plays the wizard that helps the young <UNK> overcome her curse through a big ol' chain and some blues br br i like the story but i wish it were a bit more even and didn't have to rely on the sensational the side characters were fairly decent if simple and i liked the music the acting was good enough although i can't be certain if the <UNK> character is fully believable but that might just be my <UNK> br br all in all i liked the film but i wasn't compelled by it maybe it's that i'm too critical but the story seems a little too convenient to be fully believable and so while it all seemed very cool i could never truly buy it the chain thing was a little too far fetched for me still this can provide some entertainment for those looking for dramatic redemption stories with a shot of the blues 7 10
<START> extremely slow movie there are fine performances from all actors which is why above 5 score <UNK> and are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we are shown this till it gets to a point you start asking is there a story then one day discovers <UNK> diary to find his failed college love story the college love story is totally unconvincing as <UNK> is an arrogant senior who is always picking on <UNK> beats up her friend yells at her in public and despite being terrified of him she falls in love for him even after that he continues to dominate her using crude language i certainly could not appreciate the meek character played by <UNK> i don't think any self <UNK> woman will fall for such <UNK> in real life so decides to bring them together and what happens after that is the climax the story is extremely weak in its characters a extremely arrogant <UNK> to <UNK> is the exact opposite with and there is no reason given for the sudden change in character again a extremely meek <UNK> becomes a big <UNK> when she returns wonder if she had turned so super confident why didn't she try to find her love as she no longer feared anyone
<START> and with those words one of the great movie publicity <UNK> came to a conclusion <UNK> and she spoke those words in her first sound film an adaption of the eugene <UNK> play anna christie br br unlike with some other players and some other studios mgm took great care in finding the proper vehicle for greta garbo many players who were fine in the universal medium of silent film would lose their careers because of <UNK> their heavy native accents would get in the way some didn't know any english br br it was no accident that anna christie was chosen for garbo first of all it being <UNK> by one of america's leading <UNK> it was the kind of literary property that would have <UNK> to her secondly since the title role was someone who was swedish the accent could be explained finally a lot of the <UNK> from early <UNK> had been worked out even though anna christie still made use of title cards br br like most of work it's short on action but long and deep on characterization the story takes place on the new york <UNK> where garbo as anna has come to live with her father george marion marion ran away to sea years ago when anna was a baby and marion abandoned his wife anna has had to do what she could to survive in the adult world and that includes prostitution br br marion of course is glad to see her he even kicks out marie <UNK> the old <UNK> <UNK> he's been living with for years to make room for his flesh and blood of course both marion and garbo have their problems <UNK> to each other not made easy when they give shelter to a sailor played by charles <UNK> who takes a fancy to garbo br br marion is repeating his role from the original broadway production the role of anna on stage was done by pauline lord anna christie ran for <UNK> performances in the <UNK> 22 season on broadway it's one of best known works and one that's <UNK> frequently br br of course <UNK> performance with perfect <UNK> even with a swedish accent was acclaimed and her future in sound films was assured greta garbo received an oscar nomination for best actress and the film also got nominations for clarence brown as best director and william daniels for cinematography daniels should especially get a lot of kudos for the way he photographed the <UNK> scenes and brown created the mood around the <UNK> where the film is set br br eugene work is timeless so anna christie even with a lot of the <UNK> of early sound films does not date the way many films of that era do garbo also shows she <UNK> the subtlety needed to work in the sound medium anna christie is a classic all the way around
<START> the main character has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre film past he deals with with by just <UNK> down emotionally too long a movie too much time spent on <UNK> face too much road time one of the of tv filling time with moving cars trains etc long scenes of him doing trivial sometimes totally inexplicable trivial actions with neither reason or emotion his best friends joseph and domino are not much more their relationship based on sex this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase gratuitous sex domino and mother are the two characters who display some emotion but not much it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie is it indifferent acting indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting characters in this film talk very little to anyone it's little wonder their emotionally isolated which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other
<START> you gotta be a fan of the little man but i found <UNK> on carmen dull unimaginative and totally not funny br br chaplin is retelling the story of carmen and plays a big role himself as don jose it's a story about men and the women they love although it's unclear why one would love such a woman as carmen as she is playing the men against each other br br as i said i didn't think much of it chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the br br oh and i'm curious what the difference is between this movie and the <UNK> version or is it just an imdb mistake br br on the whole 3 10
<START> not since harold and <UNK> has suicide been so successfully used as the theme for a love story the acting by a top notch cast is terrific with a well structured script things progress at an enjoyable pace there are moments of black comedy but i would <UNK> my <UNK> sweetheart as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor the relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and engaging the movie actually makes you question what is a normal relationship i highly recommend my <UNK> sweetheart seek it out on dvd under the title crazy for love you will not be disappointed <UNK>
<START> perhaps the <UNK> in alfred hitchcock's career is this straight out comedy vehicle by the director pairing carole lombard with robert <UNK> as a couple who discover a mistake has their marriage where do they really stand with each other br br contrary to what others say there is an element of suspense here the idea that these two miserable people might escape each other free to <UNK> their awfulness on some other <UNK> mate br br it's funny reading comments here about how miserable <UNK> ann smith plays out in this film because <UNK> role is as much of a <UNK> he <UNK> ann <UNK> at witnesses short <UNK> just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name ann is overbearing too of course the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty <UNK> bringing up things like what he did in paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet i <UNK> you that she says as if it was big of her br br for david a <UNK> marriage is an opportunity to have a little <UNK> pleasure with his mistress before <UNK> the <UNK> for good for ann it's an attempt at <UNK> sex that must be <UNK> with a bottle of <UNK> to the head followed by <UNK> from their apartment and her life br br the <UNK> doesn't seem to fall far from the tree as <UNK> mother is into <UNK> when she learns what david tried to pull oh my poor baby thank heaven your father is dead br br that's a rare good line in this <UNK> unlikeable comedy br br you can call this an example of the <UNK> comedy in which the bonds of <UNK> are challenged in order to be you can also call this an example of what roger ebert calls the idiot plot in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight american morality but can't really do much more with it than a scene where an older couple is by the sound of loud <UNK> br br lombard died within a year of this film's release it was the last film of hers she lived to see what a shame it couldn't have been something better she was overbearing in my man <UNK> too but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her you wanted to here she plays for laughs that aren't there while <UNK> breaking david's chops again and again <UNK> rolls his eyes a lot like <UNK> a study in br br the only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is gene raymond as david's law partner jeff <UNK> who makes a play for ann and acts with honor and decency raymond <UNK> his many reaction shots and even a drunk scene all to good effect br br spoiler so decent a guy is jeff that ann ends up <UNK> him for not fighting david after she him into a confrontation calling <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> jeff <UNK> the scene leaving ann and david together for their future murder suicide here's one <UNK> that managed to escape a massacre spoiler end
<START> this has got to be one of absolute worst movies i've ever seen in my life the writing and acting are just pathetic it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made however when i see crap like this able to make it to video it really <UNK> me to pursue my wild dreams of making films because i know i could do a better job than what the makers of killers did
<START> great news there is a bbc dvd release <UNK> for <UNK> july 2006 uk there is also a <UNK> release in states don't know the date can't wait br br below is my original comment br br i agree with all the other reviewers it is simply <UNK> that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd br br the story line is gripping the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling br br over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular <UNK> br br it's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production i'm going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens who did the production was it bbc <UNK>
<START> like classic hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse a must see for those interested in french music hall including a song by <UNK> and for the wonderful 10 plus minute <UNK> finale the dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for <UNK> br br some might object to the technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets br br consider it jean <UNK> love letter to the paris he grew up in certainly the jean <UNK> film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his hollywood productions br br
<START> this movie is somehow showing 6 2 stars it seems <UNK> that the director has that many relations i am at a loss to explain this br br avoid this movie at all costs you have only a certain number of hours on the earth don't waste 1 1 2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of <UNK> br br there is no story as apparently the director wrote and i'm guessing with a blunt orange <UNK> the next day's script at the <UNK> of the day's shooting the story has been called whimsical no it is <UNK> there is maybe enough story to fill a commercial don't you hate ads br br now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as <UNK> by his next work toy love br br so to <UNK> even if you get this movie for free even if you're paid to watch it avoid it br br to <UNK> monty <UNK> search for the holy grail run flee
<START> man i really enjoyed this if only for fred <UNK> commentary at the dog show there are some dead spots and some gags that don't work but overall the film works very well when i was younger my parents <UNK> dogs and the people that i met at those shows were not significantly less bizarre that the freaks at this show i can assure you br br i enjoyed this film for its artistry and for its commentary about how we tend to take <UNK> things far too seriously i enjoyed the acting for its accuracy most of the accents were flawless and its subtlety i loved the way each person walked their dogs br br rent this film if you have any appreciation for the <UNK> of human existence
<START> yes that's true that movie is a horrible piece of you know what almost all fans of books in <UNK> think the same the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films it's a shame when you compare and conan the barbarian for example i hope no one outside <UNK> will ever see this nightmare
<START> this late 50s french study of <UNK> youth in their early <UNK> actually grown up but not yet settled down into the adult world probably missed the mark by a mile in terms of being an accurate depiction of 1958 french youth don't virtually all youth films made by adults do this the ones that don't <UNK> edge comes to mind are rare indeed but director writer marcel <UNK> of les <UNK> du <UNK> fame is too accurate an <UNK> of humanity to not provide an insightful view of the essence of these characters in a sense the details are not important you could change the details and set this film today and it would work just as well but the loneliness and <UNK> and superficial passion and self righteous anger of the characters is captured well the young pierre <UNK> and jean paul <UNK> are in supporting roles but leads jacques <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> play the roles with subtlety and depth there is also a fine jazz score which you can get on the cd jazz in paris jazz cinema <UNK> 2 unlike some who have commented on the film i don't really see director writer <UNK> as sitting in judgment on these characters he seems as though he is an objective <UNK> to me of course these middle class characters may seem like people who are spoiled and have nothing to <UNK> about to some working class viewers of the film and i think <UNK> is certainly aware of this for this american viewer i watched a dubbed fairly literally i'd say version of this titled the <UNK> the film provides an interesting window into the france of the 1950s it also is self <UNK> poetic the scene on the <UNK> saving the cat is but one example of this and has intellectual aspirations in that charming way that only french films can get away with i can imagine the heavy handed melodramatic shallow way this kind of material would have been handled by an american studio production and the <UNK> <UNK> suggestive way this kind of material would have been handled by american drive in exploitation filmmakers i feel that marcel <UNK> has captured the essence of that period between say high school <UNK> and when by one's early 30s people have largely settled into a routine whatever that routine may be those willing to watch the film with an open mind and not fire away at the many easy targets it offers should find a serious and valuable study of people in their early <UNK> and even if you don't want to do that you can go in the other room while the film is playing and simply enjoy the fine soundtrack with great 50s jazz and <UNK> pop including the wonderful original score by an american jazz at the <UNK> group including coleman <UNK> <UNK> stan <UNK> spelled in the credits roy and ray brown
<START> walter matthau and jack lemmon both of whom are sadly missed proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen this film is just another example of this br br this time out they play two brothers in law who land on a ship as dance <UNK> on board br br of course their boss is a <UNK> and miserable person named <UNK> <UNK> who just enjoys <UNK> these boys it's hilarious how lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to matthau and how the latter dances a <UNK> with the <UNK> owner <UNK> br br too bad that fellow dance <UNK> hal <UNK> and donald <UNK> are given so little to do but their parts call for that matthau falls for <UNK> cannon on board with her fellow gold digging mother the usual outrageous <UNK> unknown to them matthau has no money either the widower lemmon falls for gloria de <UNK> looking <UNK> than ever br br the film belongs to matthau and lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their <UNK> careers
<START> i saw this on sci fi and in retrospect i'm not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through this is utter trash it's not a b movie it's a d movie at best br br basically this grim <UNK> looking thing on a horse and sometimes not on one goes killing everything in it's path somewhere in the mid west of america a load of people are missing <UNK> murdered and a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> soldier types go looking for them the best part of this movie i'll tell it now is there's some really cute girls let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off <UNK> apart or hit so hard with a <UNK> weapon that the head explodes off that's no spoiler the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque it serves no real purpose either br br here's what's good the sets look ok the actors sometimes act ok the outfits and props some of them are decent br br everything else that you can think of sucks a lot of the badness is in the editing some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and <UNK> scene sometimes the characters do non understandable things and they're always splitting up but not even in a way that the viewer can follow looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible most of it is incoherent and confusing and i don't really get how this immortal <UNK> bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end and frankly i don't care too much stupid hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i don't really care to list it all here and they're all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when it's almost laughably bad just awful br br this movie is a complete waste of time there's no excuse for watching this unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and you're bound to a chair in front of the tv but if you're not bound you're better off doing a <UNK> throwing a <UNK> or even just thinking there's lots of much better b movies that you can watch br br my senior year in high school my friend and i in visual communication and <UNK> class made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie there was no full movie just a really long trailer and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere it was better work than this movie that really says something about this and i'm puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can show br br the only movie that i've ever endured that was worse than this is <UNK> island another brilliant scifi work though it had <UNK> and more <UNK> flow than this movie but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies i've ever seen
<START> i'm usually quite <UNK> of movies and very easily entertained however this movie was dreadfully disappointing br br i watched this movie after seeing on the cover that william was in it the karate kid bad boy and during this movie i could see that this would be the only reason br br this film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent the music and sound is dreadfully tacky i couldn't believe this of a movie made in the 90's br br i wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors
<START> for everyone who has read this book <UNK> price ends up <UNK> into her own woman a beautiful woman with a brain le looks like she is on <UNK> terrible acting she just ruins it henry is a little tall for his character he is also too <UNK> mary crawford is brilliant <UNK> is a little too old mrs norris is hysterical ok this casting decision works <UNK> is also perfect <UNK> looks too <UNK> also but le is simply horrid this is not a good character for her poor <UNK> i would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete <UNK> account of the language austen uses in the novel the 1999 version is much more fun but terribly <UNK> if they could <UNK> this version with a better suited actress for <UNK> it would be fabulous
<START> more entertaining than all the gay <UNK> in 300 combined more heartbreaking than a <UNK> tragedy more poetic than even the most melodramatic <UNK> about lost love and blah blah blah and on top of all that the greatest trash ever made br br a black comedy testing the limits of the human senses john cult movie pink <UNK> is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in <UNK> death and of course the eating of dog <UNK> yeah by the way that is not actually the <UNK> part no no this is not about the impossible love there are no or on these 90 or so minutes this movie is about the battle for <UNK> if you could call it that the battle for the title <UNK> person alive br br on one side we have divine played by the cross dressing waters regular <UNK> divine a caring daughter good mother cannibal murderer <UNK> and current owner of said title she loves her son <UNK> a bit way too much <UNK> himself sports a sexual attraction to both <UNK> and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in <UNK> family friend and loyal <UNK> <UNK> gets her satisfaction from watching <UNK> during some of his acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction last but not least mother and grandmother to <UNK> edie a 400 hundred pound woman sleeping eating and basically living in a baby cradle she is addicted to eggs and loves the egg man the man who brings the eggs lol br br the four of them live <UNK> in a <UNK> outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the <UNK> <UNK> very evil people actually their main source of <UNK> comes from the kidnapping and <UNK> of young women for the <UNK> part they use their trusted and loyal cross dressing butler to provide the <UNK> after that they sale the child to the highest <UNK> br br it was the envy towards divine and her title that will lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families an epic battle of filth <UNK> and violence br br pink <UNK> is an <UNK> masterpiece in the trash movie genre loaded with <UNK> and strange acts john movie is <UNK> and hated by critics and the average movie going audience but for the few that remain by these <UNK> the <UNK> is an unforgettable experience funny and sick violent and poetic it truly is an exercise in poor taste
<START> i first remember <UNK> into this <UNK> from the <UNK> brothers and jim <UNK> back in the early days at comedy central back in those days the 90's their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k complete with <UNK> host br br capt frank played by the stone faced dead pan leslie <UNK> is a process created first from the <UNK> of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think <UNK> meets <UNK> <UNK> the show boiled in a <UNK> full of well known police television show plots and scenarios this is <UNK> 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made forget about simon pegg in hot <UNK> for now save it for later frank is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he is a master of the police <UNK> <UNK> a k a ask johnny the old shoe shine boy this does not make him a bad cop cops get lucky also capt notice he's a captain here has <UNK> it along with his partner and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes br br the show is a treasure <UNK> of hilarious dialog and <UNK> quote most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly the magic never came from the sight gags however at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the <UNK> with crazy things occurring in the background the movies can best be described as 90 minute <UNK> of the best gags from this series think of monty <UNK> and now for something completely different br br if you liked airplane 1 2 naked gun 1 2 3 or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br i always liked the series better than the movies even though i saw the movies first why 2 words no o j
<START> so you've got a number of models on an island and one by one they're picked off agatha christie style we get somebody lost at sea pushed off a cliff <UNK> by a <UNK> driven off a cliff blown up etc nothing terribly graphic br br before any of that starts one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask br br the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age br br in the end it's all about business or something br br there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot most of the bathing suits being one pieces surprisingly a couple are fairly <UNK> there's camera <UNK> during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or <UNK> within the picture the photographer is rather bad at framing
<START> while escaping from a heist of a bank the outlaw vance shaw randolph scott helps edward dean jagger the chief engineer of the western union that is <UNK> the wild west and had had an accident with a horse in <UNK> vance and is hired to work for the western union with the team that is <UNK> the <UNK> and cable from <UNK> to salt lake city vance and the engineer from <UNK> richard blake robert young <UNK> with the gorgeous <UNK> sister sue virginia <UNK> and she chooses vance however his past <UNK> him when the outlaw jack <UNK> barton steals the western union cattle disguised of indians br br western union is a good but predictable western directed by fritz lang the story shows the difficulties of the brave and idealistic men responsible for <UNK> the <UNK> through the west facing thieves and indians the entertaining story has action drama romance and funny situations but with the exception of the identity of jack <UNK> there is no surprise in the story randolph scott gives another magnificent performance with a great cast my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> the
<START> after viewing this movie lets say around 8 times the story line has never bored me each character has their own distinct personality and their own views of love this movie has timeless almost realistic love lessons filled with <UNK> on love a <UNK> soundtrack and great actors is why i would call it a classic
<START> some movies you watch and you say well that made no sense and you don't really mean it you're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical br br bread and circus makes no sense at all and i mean it and that's not because it's surreal from the start it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects there's no script there's no plot there's no story of any kind one event does not lead to the next that's how fundamental the bad writing is here br br so what i mean there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category they want to show you gore they give you gore why even talk about it br br because in this case bread and circus gave me hope okay there are some surreal elements <UNK> in the ground people <UNK> out of them the earth in space two legs on either side these sorts of images are wonderful fun odd crazy but the movie doesn't do anything with them br br stuff happens the movie ends and it's all very unsatisfying i suspect the script was made up on the fly too bad if there had been a story of any kind at all it would have made for a much more entertaining film br br the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own then you lift up the hood and there's no engine just a small man a <UNK> br br
<START> i had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in sydney although it was a pleasure to see it pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits roll br br 2 <UNK> is a film that <UNK> not just one <UNK> felt by young individuals but all of them chief of which is isolation it is not just to place the films final scene on a <UNK> above the others but rather it is important to see it as the <UNK> and from that it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly <UNK> by it br br 2 <UNK> is not a soft picture but the manner in which mr handles it's subject matter with a profound dignity and it's no holds <UNK> approach acts as credit to it's message br br i do not believe films such as 2 <UNK> should be <UNK> by votes of favour rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing br br a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost and a master stroke for a as of yet talent br br not to be missed
<START> this nifty little movie demonstrates the rock solid virtues of a time place and kind of <UNK> strength that we no longer have or even <UNK> to have the saint is a with only the best motives to say nothing of a polished <UNK> and <UNK> no need to turn up the volume or read the dialog george sanders is so charming and yes low key that all that talent <UNK> physical presence and above all <UNK> seem well almost normal some normal george clooney can not begin to master the scene as mr sanders does and does without mr <UNK> <UNK> he could play a witness the ghost and mrs <UNK> and rebecca but when he was good he was very very good truly a man for all reasons and seasons
<START> this is a movie that i watched when i was a young girl and never forgot it is certainly not the best movie ever made but there is something very special about it that i can't quite put my finger on i love it i am the kind of person who likes everything explained to me though and for that reason alone this movie drives me crazy br br exactly what who is that mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with tom why and how did he become a water baby why was he raised on the earth it is questions like these that are just eating at me i thought if i read the book i would get answers but i just read an article that the book from which this story is based is a lot different so i guess i'll never know what the writer was thinking br br i still love this movie though and i recently watched it with my two year old niece she loves it too although she insists on calling it baby water for reasons unknown to me she loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares i'm all clean you have to understand that my niece is the <UNK> 2 year old in the world we watched that scene over and over br br i am so glad that we can enjoy this film together there should be more films like this but what is up with the gay
<START> it was only the second year of the academy but already they were voting politically <UNK> brilliant performance in this <UNK> early <UNK> had to make do with an oscar <UNK> and the <UNK> went to the worst performance ever to win mary <UNK> in <UNK> the only existing print was a work print without music or final editing but wherever it's shown <UNK> and <UNK> with her <UNK> powerful performance she is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know she is lying through her teeth we did after all see her kill the man we in the audience find ourselves like the <UNK> believing in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves that is great acting the film needs to be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this terrific performance again one silent of exists in archive print man woman and sin and her only other <UNK> jealousy is lost so this is the only document we have of her run to see it when it first came out of the <UNK> to be shown in nyc in the early 70s the village voice <UNK> a full page review <UNK> the performance
<START> when i first watched i was amazed it had all the necessary features of a good movie the cast was superb the plot was superb and in the case of thrillers there was genuine thrills throughout br br <UNK> sutherland offered a marvelous performance as the male lead in the piece portraying a scientist who believes he can find the answers to life and death by killing himself and then coming back to life essentially stealing <UNK> secrets away kevin bacon offers an excellent performance as the more morally decent counterpart to <UNK> while julia roberts offers her most convincing role william baldwin portrays a student who excels in class and apparently <UNK> and oliver <UNK> in another outstanding performance portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent br br the story is relatively simple yet original and the acting is refreshing definitely a stand out film for the genre and one that has set the standard for <UNK> other thrillers for me br br 8 10
<START> <UNK> was a real life poet and rogue who lived in paris in the <UNK> century however most of what is portrayed in this historical film is actually fiction from a play created at the beginning of the 20th century whereas in the film he met and became friends with louis <UNK> in reality he died in his 30s and was never involved in all the <UNK> like he was in this film in reality he wrote some lovely <UNK> and was frequently on the wrong side of the law not the combination of a <UNK> and robin hood like character like he is in the film provided you know that the film is nearly 100 fiction then it's well worth seeing just don't assume it's a good history lesson br br in the beloved rogue is played with wild abandon by john barrymore i was also pretty excited to see that his three friends were all played by very familiar faces <UNK> <UNK> who was the <UNK> dwarf played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career slim <UNK> was a character actor known for adding a touch of comedy to films mack <UNK> is best known as the silent film foil in many of <UNK> short films and played his partner in the gold rush all four of these men did a nice job and have no complaints even with <UNK> rather over the top treatment that was rather reminiscent of a douglas fairbanks performance however the performance i had a serious problem with was conrad <UNK> as king louis <UNK> to call this <UNK> would be a gross understatement he played the role like a high <UNK> who thought he was supposed to be the stereotypical richard iii <UNK> about and acting like a caricature while <UNK> was wonderful in many many films both silent and sound but here he is just ridiculous br br as for the story it's full of <UNK> adventure and action like a <UNK> film minus the <UNK> ships the sets worked out well for all this as they'd been used the previous year for the <UNK> of <UNK> dame both films were set around the same time period br br overall it's one of the last great silent films there's a lot to like and the film is a lovely combination of romance comedy and action well worth seeing though it loses a couple of points for <UNK> overacting as well as the way the film plays fast and loose with history br br by the way this film was also made twice as if i were king <UNK> and 1938 and apparently these two films are closest to the original play however in total six films have been about and tell more or less variations on the same tale
<START> one of my all time favourite movies nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time if i could go back in time and <UNK> my memory or suffer from <UNK> <UNK> i would so i could enjoy this movie as much as i did that very first time it's still enjoyable second and third times round but i found myself <UNK> the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected if you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then i highly recommend this film its chilling shocking full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too if you watch this film and don't love it i truly question your sanity
<START> i liked this movie br br no one i know likes it but i do br br i didn't like it as much as the first one but it was still good the script and plot may not have changed at all but the story was better than <UNK> 1 br br the only reason i didn't like <UNK> 2 is br br no rodney <UNK> br br i think the movie would be better if rodney <UNK> had jackie <UNK> part although i did like jackie mason in the movie it would be alot better if they kept rodney <UNK> br br another flaw in the movie that i didn't hate as much was dan <UNK> the movie was done 8 years after the first one bill murray carl could've quit his job as an assistant and joined the military you know if warner bros had thought of that it could've made the movie better also br br this was my comment for <UNK> ii br br i give it 8 2 out of 10 br br it could've been better but good nonetheless br br if you've seen <UNK> 1 and are <UNK> on whether or not to see <UNK> 2 i say give it a try
<START> barry is a radio phone in talk show host in dallas whose no holds <UNK> ideas on a <UNK> of social issues <UNK> and offend many of his <UNK> and <UNK> is barry a media <UNK> in search of truth or a social <UNK> out to assault his audience br br this is an intense provocative character piece about a man with almost no redeeming features who at the same time seems to be onto some really profound philosophy though co written and directed by stone this is really piece all the way and he gives an astonishingly hard edged and <UNK> performance from which there is no escape barry is at times one of the most <UNK> characters imaginable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at everyone around him particularly those who care about him but at the same time he is also strangely <UNK> hypnotic <UNK> even lovable features burn into the frame with his green eyes constantly <UNK> around as if <UNK> seeking an answer to some <UNK> the movie is essentially an angry self righteous rant against all the <UNK> injustice and <UNK> in the world culminating in a wild three and a half minute <UNK> single shot of barry delivering the ultimate i hate everything speech but boy does it pack a punch the support cast are great particularly greene as the ex wife and baldwin as the boss robert <UNK> keen photography manages to keep the single radio studio set looking interesting and there's a tense score by stewart <UNK> with a moving <UNK> featuring that endearing phone music piece <UNK> and rubber band by the penguin <UNK> orchestra if you're unfamiliar with <UNK> check out his amazing talent in this flick like his <UNK> bill <UNK> and denis <UNK> he's someone who rarely appears in the mainstream media purely because his writing is so out there i find <UNK> movies <UNK> i don't much care for his big <UNK> but when he is more ordered and objective as with this or <UNK> and <UNK> he is much more <UNK> and <UNK> a great primal scream of a picture based on a play by <UNK> inspired by the true story of alan <UNK> a denver radio talk show host who was murdered by neo nazis in 1984
<START> and i do peter falk has created a role that will live on forever in tv land and i'm grateful for that this isn't one of his finest hours though columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he <UNK> a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is what all us fans know is that columbo needs a worthy <UNK> without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the <UNK> coat still it's better than no columbo and i'll wait and watch the next one as well
<START> i am sorry folks but i have to say i really cannot understand the overwhelming feelings everybody gets by seeing this movie br br when i saw it i looked at my watch to know how much more time i had to spend with this <UNK> nonsense br br so why this verdict br br first of all the movie tells a story that doesn't deliver any excitement it is not even the <UNK> distorted reality of a quentin tarantino we used to know this story could have come out of every little kid's head it doesn't have anything intelligent in it neither anything inventive and it goes on for hours the story has appropriate content for about 30 min the rest is just awfully enhanced scenes that are supposed to leave a somewhat cool image doesn't work even the previously seen <UNK> that tarantino often uses just confuse and are not in any way cool br br second some guys go to germany and kill nazis ah really do they the only nazis they killed were a handful of guys one of them being man enough to rather die than <UNK> his companions is this the ugly face tarantino wanted to give the nazis a brave soldier that is more <UNK> than any of the <UNK> certainly not fail and what happens to the terrible nazi killing <UNK> well they all get killed by nazis except two who are taken <UNK> wow what terrible monsters they are br br third any characters yes one the only role and the only <UNK> of hope for the entire movie is <UNK> who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here great acting brad pitt really sucks and is completely out acted by <UNK> never seen a such a weak performance by pitt and the rest well some germans you've never seen before and will never see after when the movie started and i saw the group of the seven <UNK> i hoped to see something like the magnificent seven a group of extraordinary guys each one with a distinct character making their way to their destiny <UNK> and knowing i was then very disappointed when i saw the <UNK> no details at all no characters no real men just some random guys you won't remember who were not given any chance to <UNK> themselves but in fact you don't even need to <UNK> cause the <UNK> except pitt hardly play any role in this movie br br so i was really disappointed and seeing this movie on place 40 of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this that leaves me with my mouth opened
<START> zero stars out of br br endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values whether it's the ridiculously bad acting the laughably awful special effects the incompetent direction the stupid script or the <UNK> annoying musical score it's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being <UNK> by a studio in the first place br br i don't think i'm going to delve into the plot other than to say it's about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fake looking creatures br br let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick first of all the acting is simply horrendous jack <UNK> is ten times worse than <UNK> stallone a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is the supporting performances aren't really any better and what is with actor luis <UNK> the guy who plays the cook francisco he has a high pitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy not a sci fi horror film br br the special effects are even worse the creatures range from weird looking <UNK> to giant <UNK> and the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie and i don't believe i need to delve further in this issue br br director j p simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films he's made i'm sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way but i don't even think it's that good everything he does is shoddy especially the <UNK> the man cannot direct a movie that's all there is to it br br this was the last of four films that took place underwater and it sure does make <UNK> and deep star six both bad films in their own right start to look masterful in comparison either way just stick with the <UNK>
<START> i'm a huge lover of really bad b movies and i especially love alien scifi movies i say the cheaper <UNK> and <UNK> the better a low budget and a hokey idea are fun enough for most bad b movies but this movie is so bad that i really felt embarrassed for the people who made the movie and for the <UNK> ad <UNK> actors first off there's no real plot it's all sort of situation comedy if it can be called that the comedy in this movie is more about characters saying in essence look at me i'm in this crazy situation isn't this funny but it's only pathetic because nothing anyone's doing is that funny there's no comedic acting skill nor any <UNK> plot to carry all the very un imaginative scenarios through this dreary turd br br the bad comedy and lack of anything remotely comical is only <UNK> by the bad ad <UNK> acting actors saying really stupid things over and over again perhaps trying to ape for catch phrases perhaps just b c everyone in this is so bad really unattractive women being played off as hot chicks and people <UNK> and passing out in <UNK> br br there was one middle aged actor toward the end of the movie who i could tell had some acting chops and was <UNK> convincing in his role he was as out of place as a solid in a weekend <UNK> <UNK> bathroom corey <UNK> was filmed for about 3 minutes in total thankfully we didn't have to put up with him any longer and he was filmed off site probably outside his apartment on the way out somewhere he said a few really un funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of his appearance br br if you value your life and the 90 minutes and years of pain in remembering you'll lose by watching this garbage avoid it if you do a lot of drugs like adam <UNK> comedy <UNK> and thus have no standards whatsoever and are considered mentally slow you might like this movie br br p s i think the people who <UNK> about this must work for troma or something b c i can't believe people can be so lame as to actually enjoy this movie do drugs really ruin your judgment that much
<START> if you know anything about the manhattan project you will find fat man and little boy at least an interesting depiction of the events surrounding that story the film is in all ways a very realistic portrayal of these events and in many ways it is almost too real such as some scenes involving radiation <UNK> paul newman as usual is brilliant in his role and always manages to come off like a real person on the screen the supporting cast such as john cusack laura dern bonnie <UNK> and natasha richardson is fairly good as well this film is not however one of the best examples of turning a true story into a movie great films are able to take a true story and use just enough artistic license to keep its audience engaged for the entire movie this one however tends to drag a bit throughout and some scenes such as john cusack and natasha <UNK> love story could have been eliminated entirely without causing the film to lose much nevertheless there are enough interesting facts and tiny humorous bits to at least keep the audience interested enough to see the entire film it does not always entertain but as far as great depictions go this is very accurate fascinating and will leave the audience with something to think about br br out of
<START> for those with access to the bbc or the cbc this has proved to be spectacular like battlestar <UNK> this is a show <UNK> from the ground up but in the case of dr who they saved the best parts i can't believe i am saying this but this is by far the best dr who this has none of the cheap production values and sometimes slow plodding of the old show the acting is quite good and there is a real sense of continuity and history the new doctor is easily the equal of the great tom baker and the writer former lead seems to have made even the minor characters come alive br br i know i'm <UNK> but this should be on everyone sci fi <UNK> list i just don't know why it hasn't made its way here whatever you do if you ever loved dr who or sci fi see this
<START> the affair is a very bad tv movie from the 1970s starring the then husband wife team of robert wagner and natalie wood as <UNK> lovers she has and leads a <UNK> existence as a pop song writer he's an ambitious lawyer who is very <UNK> and absolutely smitten with her their affair such as it is is doomed from the start and she knows it but goes along with it anyway two things to watch for if you are trapped into watching this <UNK> jane fonda <UNK> that is never <UNK> no matter what and a tune she sings early in this dreadful flick she sings it for four or five or six minutes so you know it's classic padding between commercials it also is one of the worst songs ever written and the woman doing <UNK> singing voice should have been shot and put out of her misery also keep an eye out for all the <UNK> tops and dresses by comparison wagner looks relatively timeless with close <UNK> hair and sporting a series of classic suits
<START> <UNK> should stick to singing this whole movie was a big bore i can't understand the <UNK> of the boys and the romance between miles and <UNK> the sex scenes were uninspired too the ending was awful <UNK> there needs to be reason to murder and the whole <UNK> of the boy was weird the mother always <UNK> with the boy don't you think he would get some rather <UNK> with her and why didn't someone teach <UNK> how to speak with <UNK> instead of <UNK> br br glad i only paid 1 00 to rent this br br
<START> i hope this group of film makers never re <UNK>
<START> what can i say after i say the one line summary sandra does a credible job but what with the bad direction and story line it can't save it way too much pre <UNK> with guns how can the hollywood types rant about the need for gun control in our society and spend so much time and film footage focused on guns it's just worse than expected
<START> the movie that would be included if mystery science theater 3000 had a home game version the source material for tacky comments in this movie are endless i found the video of terror in the jungle at a garage sale what a find
<START> <UNK> been able to see this great movie at the <UNK> in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down g <UNK> really seen lots of movies and there are just a few <UNK> call perfect like fight club or <UNK> <UNK> cruelty is now one of them half of the people watching it in berlin went out of the room and i can understand this absolutely because it can be a real shock for someone living in his her perfect world day by day dreaming his her dreams not thinking bout the horror on our planet in our life i <UNK> think i have to describe the story of the film for you because of the people having already written on this page it´s a movie that shows everything and more gets 10 points from 10 <UNK> be cool if you people who have also seen it loving it would write me an e mail so far i <UNK> met anyone as impressed and pleased by it as i am finally sorry for my bad english <UNK> not a studied person <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gut so
<START> i'm almost embarrassed to admit to seeing <UNK> twice the problems with the production are almost too numerous to mention the script is sub standard it's easy to see why <UNK> tried to <UNK> it the direction is worse most of the movie consists of long shots inter cut with close ups interspersed with cross cuts of mostly un erotic porn more prevalent obviously in the uncut version the cinematography is especially sub par giving the whole production a cheap washed out look that <UNK> some of the elaborate set designs the movie should've looked a whole lot better the overall concept of placing name actors in what would've easily been an x rated movie called it wears thin after the first hour after peter o'toole and john <UNK> exit bob obviously <UNK> a lot of bucks on this but it all seems like a big waste if you want a far better understanding of the roman empire in the 1st century watch the mid bbc production of i <UNK> instead and if you want porn louise look somewhere else
<START> to be honest the movie was so horrible that i loved it never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i was in shock i mean i don't even know what to say br br the characters couldn't even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an and his friend had an <UNK> then in the next scene they switched guns don't ask trust me i know my guns and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam to an arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in california that is what i took from it br br why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic <UNK> at you how is that frightening i wanted to swallow <UNK> halfway through the movie i love how the <UNK> man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day but hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a <UNK> of fire ants br br good day
<START> i haven't seen this film since it came out in the mid 70s but i do recall it as being a very realistic portrayal of the music business right up there with paul <UNK> one trick <UNK> another vastly underrated film imo br br harvey keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial tripe the record company suits want him to work with br br since i spent my entire career in the music business as a composer <UNK> producer i can really <UNK> for the <UNK> this film possesses br br if it should ever come out on dvd uncut i'd buy it
<START> this movie sucks did anyone notice that the entire movie was shot in like 2 rooms there are never any outside shots and if there are its obviously film taken from somewhere else this movie blows hard painful to sit through too stay far away
<START> how many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime well i'll go out on a <UNK> and say one this movie is better watched late at night with a 12 pack of beer the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue br br on a pacific island a young man is sentenced to death for with the evil americans seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the can be king well he <UNK> to come back and <UNK> revenge br br before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the american <UNK> <UNK> screaming come br br it seems the young corpse has done just that as the walking tree monster yes his revenge is terrible and so is this movie it seems that these natives cannot run from a <UNK> tree so he <UNK> them in <UNK> rolls them down hills etc pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw br br general problems with this movie are numerous the comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a cockney accent like this movie needs comedy you want her to die upon her first appearance the leading lady is whiny the leading man is a <UNK> the acting is wooden pun intended the dialogue is stiff and <UNK> the natives have brooklyn accents the monster suit is pure <UNK> br br while this is a bad movie it still is fun to watch it gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasn't mobile
<START> three is a seriously dumb <UNK> movie <UNK> as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the <UNK> superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole <UNK> <UNK> parents attempting to re define their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> psycho killer it provided sharp increasingly suspense a scary feeling of <UNK> in open <UNK> as the cat and mouse game of life and death <UNK> br br three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some <UNK> hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an <UNK> mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing <UNK> and <UNK> with barely controlled sexual violence here he is <UNK> <UNK> slimy and <UNK> and where does he get his seemingly <UNK> supply of dry <UNK> and <UNK> and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms <UNK> is very <UNK> stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over <UNK> by some sort of life raft <UNK> they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the <UNK> sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoo <UNK> the third <UNK> of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a <UNK> of <UNK> no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way <UNK> represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun br br plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible br br i'm guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and <UNK> dvd the reason for this is it's not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema
<START> christian propaganda lots of fear <UNK> br br this is not scifi this is christian fiction the movie started out ok but took a sharp christian right turn from then on it was all about god <UNK> the holy bible and the devil the <UNK> are really just demonic deception to fool people in to believing that there is other intelligent life in the universe <UNK> idea is to trick you in to thinking that there could be more to life than what is in the bible br br the <UNK> could be used to explain away the rapture the people left behind would believe it was a mass alien <UNK> instead of god taking all the christians to heaven no reason to <UNK> if its aliens the deeper message in the movie is that if you don't believe in god and have <UNK> in your life than you believe in nothing and your life has no purpose
<START> is there anything else on earth to be more <UNK> than to learn what expects our <UNK> bodies after um death spanish director <UNK> a soul mate of his german colleague <UNK> <UNK> provides blow by blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of <UNK> tables <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> human <UNK> and <UNK> minds br br welcome to the <UNK> room br br i don't know which <UNK> of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to <UNK> <UNK> high rating br br <UNK> it's fairly simple and straightforward a day in the life actually half an hour of a troubled <UNK> or perhaps assistant <UNK> or whoever he is that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and <UNK> his psychological tension in a non traditional fashion right at his <UNK> i'm <UNK> of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one note plot i suspect it may be somehow inspired by <UNK> character's quirky demeanor in andy <UNK> frankenstein br br artistic values of the film are also questionable it's hard to <UNK> the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word their emotions are <UNK> behind the medical masks there's also not enough room for great camera work basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls br br authenticity effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medical <UNK> experts can judge how truthful and <UNK> correct the <UNK> is carried out here if anyone cares honestly i used to think that the <UNK> is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to <UNK> the cause of death now i know that dead bodies are severed raped and <UNK> intestines are ripped apart brains are <UNK> from the head stuffed into <UNK> and mixed with guts then the body is <UNK> back and washed nothing personal and what are these poor <UNK> expected to write in their <UNK> <UNK> reports afterward br br shock and disgust factor it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video <UNK> on <UNK> this obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to <UNK> this film they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see br br is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy <UNK> 'the <UNK> amazing black and white short and 30 minute visually stunning and moody piece with an off beat and interesting concept and i'm pretty sure that one day he will <UNK> the hearts of <UNK> with his new more mainstream oriented material and sooner or later would become a <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> of his early warm up works br br but in the meantime i'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or <UNK> that study mental <UNK> and sexual <UNK>
<START> the 33 percent of the nations <UNK> that still support w bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of <UNK> as strikingly similar to the post 9 11 <UNK> political landscape maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a they deserve it's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again they've clearly shown they have no sense of character br br what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly <UNK> as <UNK> a haunted empty man who simplistic <UNK> ideology can't help him <UNK> the boundaries between safety and <UNK> execution and murder self defense and <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the hopeless situation he's helped create sound like any <UNK> retarded <UNK> <UNK> you know of br br blows the <UNK> off the screen as sympathetic as plight is it's <UNK> to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the <UNK>
<START> this movie is one of the best and moving i have ever seen because of the terrible good performance of the main actress jennifer <UNK> as jamie harris who really makes you feel with her also the music by mark snow is wonderful
<START> totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way what it is about <UNK> i believe probably up to the viewer but i found that this movie tries to say something about the <UNK> and <UNK> behind all the designer furniture and perfect <UNK> don't know if i'm right but this movie really got to me see it i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style and i forgot the casting here i superb with being perfect in the role as the <UNK> man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why the <UNK> of not understanding the purpose of life in the city is what makes him <UNK> all the others do as they are told and pretend to be happy this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006
<START> so much for judge and jury which lives up to its nonsense title what good is there the lighting is terribly <UNK> another horror movie you ask well that's perfectly <UNK> david keith actually does pretty good at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> while being the killer who escaped death row but overall despite some new twists it's reasonably stupid has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently and this one only means so much we the jury find this film guilty for its <UNK> exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time
<START> i thought this movie was awesome and the two guys nick and aaron are <UNK> i wish i could watch it over and over i loved the plot and whole concept of the movie it is great and i wish i had taped it last night nick i love you
<START> if you wish to see shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety i suggest you find this bbc version indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but performance as hamlet and patrick stewart's as <UNK> are well worth the effort br br it never <UNK> to <UNK> me how clear hamlet is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the <UNK> every film version of hamlet has <UNK> with its structure olivier concentrated on <UNK> <UNK> gibson on his passions <UNK> is able to pull all of these aspects of <UNK> character together with the aid of shakespeare's full script br br why does hamlet not kill <UNK> immediately hamlet says i am very proud ambitious hamlet is extremely upset not only for his father's death and suspected murder or his mother's marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because <UNK> has <UNK> the throne <UNK> to hamlet he is furious at his mother for marrying <UNK> <UNK> between royal <UNK> is not unknown done for political reasons but that her marriage <UNK> <UNK> claim to the throne before he could return from to claim it for himself he is therefore <UNK> to do anything about it and this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so he must out the king's secret and here is the tragedy at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying <UNK> guilt in public he has opportunity to kill him and does not why he wants it all he wants revenge the throne and the <UNK> of <UNK> soul in hell hamlet himself in classic tragic form his own <UNK> is his <UNK> he kills <UNK> thinking it is <UNK> and the rest of the play <UNK> down to the final deaths of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hamlet himself
<START> i suspect there's some <UNK> history going on here but one definitely comes away with the feeling that <UNK> was a trouble maker who <UNK> his people to violence from the moment the <UNK> <UNK> independence his inability to control his people and his decision to bring in soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the united states involved and led to his assassination however by replacing him with the united states didn't solve anything they made the situation just as bad well acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score definitely worth seeing
<START> i must admit i didn't expect this to be as good as it was i also didn't expect samuel l jackson to play slide and sing blue either br br of <UNK> county <UNK> does this frequently they <UNK> movies in the <UNK> get you all excited about seeing it and then disappoint you by not showing it br br i expected that with such a great cast of jackson and <UNK> and even a former <UNK> timberlake that this movie would at least have shown for a week but <UNK> at that time if i remember correctly was showing on 3 screens that or some other type of supposed blockbuster br br like blues brothers and <UNK> this movie <UNK> the <UNK> and legend of what blues music is all about passion and hard times religion and sex hell <UNK> of the past redemption i mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work br br this was just a good all around story of course not many people will see it cause it doesn't have pirates or swinging <UNK> but it does have samuel l jackson br br think of what happens to <UNK> character from pulp fiction after he walks the earth and <UNK> down and that essentially describes him to a t br br great and underrated but aren't all the good ones like that anyway
<START> i really enjoyed watching hell to pay i've been a fan of westerns for as long as i can remember and this one reminded me of a lot of the westerns from the 1960s even though i was too young to have seen them in their first run the one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music it was distracting at times one thing i did notice and i wonder how many other fans of <UNK> noticed was the name of buck <UNK> character it was a play on doc <UNK> name from <UNK> instead of adams buck taylor used adam <UNK> i wonder if that was his choice or chris <UNK> anyway i would recommend this movie to fans of westerns don't expect anything too deep just plain old entertainment
<START> after seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for <UNK> foreign films i thought it looked very entertaining before watching the movie i went on to imdb to see what ratings and comments it received i was worried when i noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings despite the hype i watched to movie and to my surprise i found it unbelievable br br the story was great just pay attention and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing i haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time i really felt for both characters and <UNK> a strong bond as reading previous <UNK> about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts i could not disagree more this film is what it is its not braveheart and its not enter the dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action br br while sword in the moon isn't perfect what movie is it still is wonderful and moving just wait until the ending scene with the music and cinematography together its breathtaking i only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting
<START> i first saw this <UNK> in the uk in the 1980's and found myself intrigued and then <UNK> at how such good intentions could go so wrong previous <UNK> who are australian have explained the unfolding <UNK> detail better than i ever could but i would like to make an observation about what may lie behind the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all modern laws as i understand them need an <UNK> or philosophical root to exist in the first place and to become a law at all that being the case and if say the mess had been possibly set up just how many <UNK> had been served by presumably without complaint then the <UNK> government could have been victims of which would surely have had to have been by the <UNK> general as or until he could see that the budget <UNK> was a genuine result of and not elaborate <UNK> <UNK> by or person's <UNK> if its the case that kerr in effect didn't have to refer to the law because <UNK> circumstances <UNK> everything then <UNK> borders onto the <UNK> in any <UNK> country is that rules literally and that any person or <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> to break any other rule physical or mental so long as they have the control over the purse strings ultimately
<START> this is a great concert which featured the best songs of the <UNK> 30 year career lee and were animated and fun on stage and delivered a great show that being said i think the audio recording was <UNK> at the mixing <UNK> and or through the process this is not the fault of the boys however they even mentioned that the show was setup last minute so the band and their crew obviously did their best they just shouldn't have put the show out for public <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sounds distant and bass has good <UNK> content but no bottom end at all they should have held out on this concert and waited for a better occasion only buy this dvd if you are a hardcore the quality is lacking in the audio department
<START> this film is so awful it is funny not quite to <UNK> 2 levels of hilarity but funny nonetheless the acting is awful the music is atrocious and the story does not make a blind bit of sense the story revolves around a man dressed in an awful <UNK> costume killing a bunch of people at a party the death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious one girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest but does not scream try or defend or self or run away she also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious no thought seems to have been put into the plot the <UNK> seems to magically move from one area to another e g be hiding under leaves in a <UNK> just where the victim just happens to stand appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people i would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like <UNK> 2 the <UNK> or blood <UNK> but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie you will be disappointed
<START> i first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend it was a fun romp with some cool music <UNK> was on the playboy cover and the <UNK> as i recall she's really cute and <UNK> and has lots of charm the movie made me want to see more of her and so i kept a look out for her in other stuff she's in steven spielberg's i wanna hold your hand and barbara <UNK> the main event and bill <UNK> <UNK> plus lots of tv shows like night court and tv movies me and my friends really enjoy her but her starring role in alice in wonderland puts the focus right where it ought to be right on <UNK> as the center of attention probably the <UNK> <UNK> girl i've ever seen in movies
<START> i found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch and i'm surprised it's rated so <UNK> actually i can see why it is i imagine it's the fans of eric roberts and <UNK> <UNK> that have been giving most of the <UNK> and <UNK> because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie and <UNK> for about 5 scenes in the second half and in those she says little and wears less although never nude if that's what you're looking for stick with embrace of the vampire although they're always a pleasure it's a pity she or eric don't get much screen time yet i still give this an 8 br br
<START> i thought it was an excellent movie gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who <UNK> his death <UNK> over all i thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line it's sad to say but i think lots of men might feel this way i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he <UNK> his death i thought it was neat that <UNK> real life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie i think what the guy did was <UNK> extreme but the movie was great nonetheless definitely recommend it
<START> considering the appalling track record of mick since going out on his own i had rather low expectations of <UNK> even the <UNK> posters for the movie had me nervous in fact if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview i would have <UNK> the pressure from the <UNK> who thinks <UNK> a hunk there's a worry to pay money for it br br the first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of tired get angry at insignificant things routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing the rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical mick and <UNK> lucy humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the <UNK> it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting and it was br br there's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one liners and other jokes i never felt it <UNK> on any element too long or too short mick must have worked hard on <UNK> his script there were a one or two late show in jokes and one or two jokes that only would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience br br something that i found disappointing was the relative of john clarke he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy but that doesn't detract from the movie too much br br over all i enjoyed this comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie i left the cinema with a decent sized grin a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books 7 5 10 br br
<START> this movie has all the qualities to be good stan singing dancing falling is very funny i think he handled his character in the best way possible it's a parody and very well done maybe times can change there's another audience but if you want to laugh come on see it
<START> is a long excruciating journey from bad to worse in the life of protagonist after whom the movie is named young gas <UNK> first world war lieutenant of very delicate health who previously was a doctor in an <UNK> for children with some mental goes in a search of their new location and finds much more than he ever intended to and quite of a different nature <UNK> atmosphere of ultimate despair where the insane ones are much less horrible than the sane where the madness is a kind of poetry will hold you <UNK> from the very first frames of this film to the last and all the beauty beauty of the winter and mountains beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods i don't even know how all the sorrow and sadness of last days of war could be made so beautiful
<START> at first i thought <UNK> man' might be one of those <UNK> new <UNK> films as someone noted earlier the movie does not look poorly made it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot better angles better sound equipment good looking actors and <UNK> locations br br however the <UNK> are all purely superficial if it weren't for all the polish and expensive <UNK> <UNK> man' would feel just like your typical second rate local movie <UNK> drama predictable plot twists yeah right moments crying screaming and characters you could care less about all shoved down your throat br br a couple of things annoyed me about this movie first of all since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family that not blood related argument does not make an ounce of difference second would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped simply because the father told her to keep it secret and where the hell were the lights in this movie i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic but i was simply forced to turn up the <UNK> feature on my tv set
<START> i am no ebert what i am is a compassionate and i have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than i felt for <UNK> p fitzgerald sorry if i do not offer a critique but i see nothing but perfection in this film i am sure that many who watch this film will never see the same things i do but if you look hard enough maybe you will see something you weren't expecting i've read that the character of <UNK> was flawed it seems to me that who wrote this was not able to see past the question this movie presents i feel sorry for anyone who doesn't see the answers this movie delivers open your heart more than your mind and you may be able to let this <UNK> p fitzgerald show you a world that truly has a meaning story with extraordinary acting ryan <UNK> deserves to be talked about
<START> this 3 hour made for tv miniseries came home with us from <UNK> this weekend the production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets <UNK> bridget fonda especially and special effects including a great jim <UNK> talking polar bear <UNK> they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script the story line was so loose that it really never came together one can overlook irish <UNK> germans but not <UNK> jerky storytelling with senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the devil this one is certainly not destined to be a christmas classic a shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads
<START> my dinner with <UNK> is a glimpse at howard <UNK> and <UNK> ride to fame with his 60's folk rock band the <UNK> the <UNK> were kind of a <UNK> act during the sixties but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat drink and party with the <UNK> of hippie culture and not only that they had the musical chops to back it up many of the stellar acts of the era are seen as they interact with the band at work and at play this provides my only complaint about the film almost from the beginning of the movie one sees that it is nearly impossible to find actors who can convincingly <UNK> such recognizable stars too often during the film i felt that i was watching an engaging <UNK> of phony <UNK> and <UNK> but if you are a fan of the music of the <UNK> or the swinging 60's in general this might be the film for you and don't forget to view the extras there is a very funny and informative bit by band members mark and howard about their disastrous experiences with <UNK> and agents
<START> it's a puzzle to me how this turd of a film ever got distribution br br sure it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity but by god the production value is the lowest i've ever seen the equipment used is worse than standard home equipment everything is <UNK> giving everything an amateurish look bringing your thought to america's worst home <UNK> or whatever that show was called br br please people is it too much to ask that you actually do an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of peoples lives watching this you really should have done some short projects first cause it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs 1 10
<START> you can't take it realistically sheets br br zombie bloodbath 2 is a world all of its own i've really never seen anything like it the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs forgive the don't simply mean that it's incoherent and absurd though occasionally it is i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to <UNK> you and when it's over you find that it's all happened while you were sitting on the couch br br it is worth noting that it's extremely low budget as a <UNK> to those who after seeing shaun of the dead consider themselves fans of underground zombie films also of note is that it is much more brutal than you'd expect children get <UNK> and someone <UNK> a teenage girl before shooting her in the <UNK> her corpse is subsequently raped these are certainly not flaws and indeed i feel it is to the film's credit but if it doesn't sound like your kind of movie don't waste your time br br i don't mean to over hype it regarding brutality don't go in expecting inside or something i hesitate to give away any of the plot because it's really full of surprises even the opening scene which has nothing to do with zombies is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original br br man i'm three <UNK> in and i've hardly said anything at all here's why i thought the movie was awesome 1 it's big and it keeps moving at one point you expect it to turn into another <UNK> clone a board up the windows movie where everyone stays in a <UNK> and <UNK> with one another by the end of the film however the <UNK> scenes will seem like a distant dream there are also a number of <UNK> urban scenes these are rare in low budget zombie films br br 2 the makeup gore is much better than <UNK> more convincing and more creative something kind of funny the early zombies look really lame then halfway through they suddenly look really good with <UNK> and everything some of them look like fulci zombies some are reminiscent of mr tongue from day of the dead and it's got big scenes of dozens of zombies <UNK> around never gets old br br 3 there's something oddly emotional about it one character <UNK> that heaven exists and that our dead undead protagonists are now in heaven in the context of the film we believe it to be true though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity they genuinely seem to care about each other and <UNK> i found myself caring about them br br 4 the pacing is great there's hardly a dull moment br br my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i've ever heard i personally feel it adds to the experience but i don't think he does it on purpose so i can't fairly give the film a perfect rating example when a car breaks down the owner yells at the passengers then he says something to the effect of sorry i <UNK> at you guys you don't know what it's like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you're five years old wtf at the very end it gets to be more than i can handle involves a montage with bill <UNK> and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor really by this point i was firmly re living my drug experiences br br highly recommended 7 10
<START> i couldn't help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in 1996 apparently email is an <UNK> discussion similar to a chat with lame voice <UNK> reading every comment out loud and some of the other tech aspects are also laugh out loud funny i'd swear the high tech <UNK> centre she has actually has a few <UNK> 64 <UNK> in it almost like watching the movie <UNK> nowadays i guess br br despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can't ignore i mean why include something so stupid br br anyway to sum up the plot is pretty predictable the acting bad the killer quite but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre 3000 kind of way i guess
<START> g m started a the odd couple <UNK> in man about the house and went on to amusing the nation in their own sitcom br br what was the typical small scale personal charm of the couples chemistry on the small screen g <UNK> to the big screen was as appalling as and wise and countless fine tv shows br br unfunny unsatisfying and featuring an ill <UNK> <UNK> who died before the film was released
<START> one night at 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br according to <UNK> the director of one night at this film is a dark comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can all perceive different realities it's the same story told from three different points of view and each time we tell the story we try to reveal a little bit more about what actually happened which nobody really knows br br one night at marks the feature film directorial debut of an award winning commercial and music video director who began making short films when he was eight years old i always get nervous when a director of commercials and music videos turns to filmmaking we have seen so many examples of how these guys think they are making another <UNK> or music video for tv with their productions <UNK> that tendency he captures a specific humorous truth in one night at from an inventive complex screenplay by the late stan even if it is often somewhat <UNK> br br one night at features three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman in some ways this movie is the comedy version of american beauty but in others it is a world apart br br it all started one night at explains each of the three men to their various <UNK> there is randy matt dillon a tender at the local bar and his cousin a lawyer named carl paul reiser who stays until the place <UNK> detective john goodman arrives when the saloon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female fatal appropriately named jewel <UNK> tyler randy is the first to see her as an individual treats her <UNK> he stands up for her and before you can say sexy they are having <UNK> sex and she moves in with him at first randy is reluctant the sex and the violence all in one night  it's a little much but who could turn a jewel like jewel away br br jewel changes the lives of each of the three men for detective she pulls him out of a hole of grief since his wife died for carl she makes him forget his loving family and nice little suburban household for randy she lights a few fires both positive and negative the later <UNK> him to contact a <UNK> playing hit man named michael douglas to put an end to her <UNK> ways br br it is interesting how the movie <UNK> the three different chronicles even the <UNK> of jewel is relative to the man telling the story sees jewel as a beautiful mesmerizing gift from god carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of <UNK> randy is unsure what to make of her an awakening to his otherwise boring road to nowhere life the most intriguing element of this movie is jewel herself however deliciously played by the always delightful <UNK> tyler <UNK> she is not really interested in the men but what they can offer her her motives are all too simple not <UNK> diabolical or evil she is simply a young lady who has learned at an early age that she can get what she wants out of life through her beauty br br the film has a lot of fun with its material from the <UNK> entertaining cast to its violently hilarious showdown one night at takes advantage of most of its humorous ideas what makes the movie even funnier is how the three men's points of view <UNK> the actors have a lot of fun with their characters too goodman is curiously whimsical reiser fits his kinky <UNK> part quite well douglas is sly and mysterious in one of the movie's funniest performances dillon gives his character arrogant personality even though randy is a lackluster nobody <UNK> tyler is dazzling she <UNK> jewel with the perfect amount of <UNK> charisma and <UNK> wit she reminds us of <UNK> intimate performance in american beauty br br one night at is the first film to come from michael <UNK> new production company films it is a creative genuine and sexy production along the way we often become caught up in the <UNK> structure but that is a natural response to a movie that intentionally <UNK> several angles to a single story the movie ends on a note that is both black and comedic this is another one of those comedies in which serious events take place in a humorous way i e the black comedy many films of this genre come across as either too black or too <UNK> one night at is one of the few that actually work br br
<START> of the korean movies i've seen only three had really stuck with me the first is the excellent horror a tale of two sisters the second and third and now fourth too have all been park chan movies namely <UNK> sympathy for lady vengeance and now <UNK> br br park kinda reminds me of quentin tarantino with his <UNK> towards convention all his movies are shocking but not in a gratuitous sense it's more like he shows us what we don't expect to see typically situations that go <UNK> against <UNK> morals like incest or a <UNK> blood sucking yet <UNK> priest he's also quite artistically inclined with regards to cinematography and his movies are among the more gorgeous that i've seen br br <UNK> is all that being about said priest and the repressed conscience less woman he falls for and more it's horror drama and even comedy as park <UNK> his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations as such this might be his best work for me yet since his other two movies that i've seen were lacking the humor element that would've made them more <UNK> for repeat viewings
<START> i saw <UNK> queen in 2005 over a decade after it was made amidst <UNK> controversy in india the language the stark treatment and the natural acting by a relatively unknown cast for that time might have been even more shocking at that time for an indian <UNK> more familiar with fantasy cinema the film the cast and <UNK> kapoor deserve <UNK> for the breakthrough effort br br the plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama made in various forms in india in fact there have been several fictional accounts of this particular story itself the reason why this stands out is that it's supposed to be a first person account of someone who actually went through all this and a lot else that doesn't find place on the screen and survived to tell the tale survived long enough to see her story made into a movie at least <UNK> didn't live very long after being released from prison in 1994 br br the film scores on several counts the cinematography is brilliant the music is apt the cast many of whom became more familiar names later is very good but the screenplay is <UNK> things move too fast and in <UNK> at times it's understandable though because there are just too many <UNK> that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive or maybe i felt that because i have read <UNK> <UNK> book which is a more detailed and better though obviously not as shocking as the visual account of <UNK> and which is <UNK> to be one of the main sources for the film br br there are some factual <UNK> too according to <UNK> she wasn't present when the massacre took place and despite claiming to be the <UNK> account of herself she is shown to participate and in fact <UNK> the massacre then the final scene where <UNK> shows her touching the feet of the chief minister while in reality she had <UNK> to a portrait of <UNK> gandhi symbolic value only but shows that didn't want to show <UNK> to a living ordinary person it would have been nice to show the chief minister to have some resemblance to <UNK> <UNK> who many remember was the <UNK> of then br br but these are small <UNK> in this <UNK> well made movie a rare gem to come out from the mainstream indian film industry made by a man who before this was known best for the ultimate <UNK> movie of the late 80s mr india
<START> mgm <UNK> of jimmy <UNK> throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood no major stars show up we get the three stooges laurel hardy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i didn't recognize anyone else they were probably <UNK> for good reason the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel <UNK> battle with <UNK> <UNK> and a wonderful color disney cartoon called the hot chocolate soldier it's a beautiful very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost otherwise the movie is a <UNK> bore there's no director credited what does that tell you
<START> now don't get me wrong i love a good film and after watching the thin red line and loving it i was eager to track down <UNK> two earlier films and having just watched days of heaven my enthusiasm to see <UNK> has virtually disappeared br br i have noted much rave about the beautiful photography but i saw this film on a terribly old vhs tape which made it look pretty awful all i can say is i hope the photography was superb because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film not since the replacement killers have i fallen asleep during a film this film felt so long and it wasn't the editing was choppy and disjointed the storyline non existent the voice over was an incoherent <UNK> the characters <UNK> developed and the whole thing was <UNK> i know that <UNK> was uncertain of how to do the film he consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together this is very apparent on screen everything looks chopped up every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum or some character development it would <UNK> cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things it was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people <UNK> the few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest i would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly over rated something must be said br br maybe a farmer would like it
<START> it's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film most early german films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early german <UNK> like e t a hoffman and others in fritz <UNK> der <UNK> also from <UNK> death <UNK> takes a young man away from his sweetheart but in <UNK> film the characters' destiny cannot be <UNK> by behavior neither of the young lovers deserves to die but they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death br br in victor however <UNK> is always an option destiny can be altered and death <UNK> through the characters' choices although scenes of the phantom <UNK> collecting souls are genuinely eerie these horrific images of death as the great <UNK> are <UNK> by <UNK> offer of redemption to the real monster of this tale david <UNK> a brutal drunk who because of a perverse hatred of humanity <UNK> <UNK> and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with br br one new year's eve <UNK> is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight <UNK> must become the driver of the phantom <UNK> and collect souls during the new year the phantom <UNK> driven by an old <UNK> who had started <UNK> on his road to ruin comes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery along the way <UNK> sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him br br perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the <UNK> novel on which the film is based but i would have preferred to see david <UNK> unable to escape his destiny and to see his <UNK> come too late to prevent his wife from <UNK> his two children and herself and to see <UNK> suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls it would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others in the film however the nature of destiny isn't the message redemption is the driver of the <UNK> allows <UNK> spirit to return to his body and he <UNK> his family in the nick of time his <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in a christmas carol br br if the trite and sentimental ending does not offend you there is still much to admire in the film's images the special effects are astonishing when <UNK> by the standards of the day and still hold up which is more <UNK> when you consider that these double <UNK> were created inside a hand <UNK> camera also the restored film on new dvd looks fabulous
<START> ah batman returns is it possible to have a sequel to be almost as good as the original with batman returns it came pretty close we have terrific actors and a great plot with the dark knight and two new villains <UNK> and the penguin we have michael keaton back as batman and he's still awesome than ever michelle <UNK> the perfect choice for <UNK> and was perfectly cast into place as much as i love and is such an incredible actress <UNK> <UNK> she couldn't have been <UNK> she doesn't really have the look danny <UNK> who could have imagined him as the penguin he was just great and terrifying br br batman returns with a more loving community of <UNK> city they are celebrating christmas time with max shrek played by a creepy christopher walken the perfect villain who <UNK> his lovely secretary <UNK> who happens to hear too much at his office causing him to push her out the window in hopes that she dies and will never reveal the information of knowing the penguin and the attempt to make him loved in <UNK> when she survives and is <UNK> by cats she wants revenge and is ready to go at it with her cats but there is also another active villain the penguin who is in search of his parents that abandoned him and now he is looking to be the new mayor of <UNK> city can batman be able to stop both super villains from creating their acts and stop the mayor from destroying the city as well br br you'll have to see batman returns is just as good as the original batman despite the first one remaining the true classic this one still takes you for a ride and come on i mean we've got michelle in leather her classic moment of just meeting batman and the penguin <UNK> is classic there are memorable characters lines and sets you'll have a blast trust me br br 9 10
<START> another lame attempt to make a movie gritty and thought provoking whatever the hell that means they have al pacino say a lot of words like television killed football yeah whatever this is another movie that showcases oliver <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something why does he insist on <UNK> the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs he even throws cameron diaz into the <UNK> for purely aesthetic reasons it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad br br ever since <UNK> of woman writers and directors have used pacino to <UNK> their pathetic lines his characters are nothing more than <UNK> their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite he needs to <UNK> himself showing how he can act without yelling he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like organized football is messed up and act out a good story
<START> <UNK> <UNK> masterful rendering of this epic of the heart deserves a much wider audience it is a worthy <UNK> to the classics such as <UNK> and <UNK> as well as <UNK> the 19th century is indeed a <UNK> source for italian filmmakers the period settings and <UNK> are beautifully realized here but the story is timeless and could occur in any period what is so intriguing in this story is that the hero becomes trapped in a claustrophobic situation in which he finds himself the <UNK> pursued object of desire and he is quite <UNK> to <UNK> himself from the <UNK> circumstances handsome and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is frustrated by his inability to visit his charming but light minded married mistress and falls prey to the dangerous passion of <UNK> the ugly and <UNK> daughter of his stern commander <UNK> the resulting anguish and ensuing tragedy this unlikely pair <UNK> make them both understandable pitiful and immensely sympathetic to viewers bernard stellar performance will <UNK> and leave a lasting impression not to be missed
<START> yet another recent comedy that shows that hollywood can't even do the <UNK> when it comes to film making that it used to do in its sleep for decades if the writer director had any brains they would have based the film around <UNK> character of <UNK> boss jack taylor when he's in the film early on it's nothing special but it is mildly promising and occasionally amusing once he <UNK> for the majority of the film and <UNK> has his <UNK> adventures house sitting with guest after boring guest dropping in the film totally <UNK> br br as a result what should have been a passable turns into an inept stinker
<START> peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun ho <UNK> making me hate him <UNK> he used the n word i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out just think peter boyle was a monk once now a supporting actor in everybody loves raymond susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water i noticed a large ann doll creator john was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs free love and <UNK> dreams then enjoy the excellent direction of john g rocky and the karate kid i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others
<START> this is a film that left me breathless wanting to learn more of the <UNK> history and traditions with todays evil <UNK> <UNK> reality it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs br br casting was impeccable the scenery simply marvelous the acting was first rate and the fact that the academy overlooked this except it's music is unforgivable br br the script is wonderful and such and emotional journey provoking an ugly cry from this watcher br br a film worth watching a second and third time
<START> there is no reason to watch this film br br why many reasons first up the acting is awful there is hardly a line that isn't but that is hardly surprising given the <UNK> stupidity and <UNK> of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth it is awfully written one of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line br br repeat br br yes they repeat it for the whole movie br br the whole movie br br yes the whole movie br br etc br br in movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after all the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys setting up a good with x in my grasp i will rule the universe villain is the first stop in any <UNK> sf plot but in this turkey you tell me br br as i understand it our <UNK> are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a dirty dozen type mission they are sent by a <UNK> <UNK> state to stop some other mass murderers from <UNK> the course of history the new history would not include the rise of <UNK> and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on screen situation reports just before the action starts telling you who is who and what is what it's an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen just to save the audience from <UNK> their brains too much by doing a lot of reading so just who are we supposed to be rooting for here i guess we are asked to believe our hero <UNK> some sort of journey from <UNK> to love peace and understanding while shooting loads of people but that doesn't work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent ish human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station br br i guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an <UNK> mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap sf movies br br the opening credits were nice
<START> a dark yet humorous tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings most of the film contained questionable acting plot props and filming the fight scenes were as hokey as a middle <UNK> rendition of a wwii battle the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there the props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount the majority of the film appeared to be shot in <UNK> basement in some scenes you could see the <UNK> <UNK> in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement the plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions i felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series it is similar to the movie blade in that he is an african american vampire hunter however that is where all similarities end and the movie looks closer to a saturday night live spoof
<START> in the final days of the year 1999 most everyone in <UNK> has died a strange plague has <UNK> the island supposedly spread by <UNK> the disease sends its victims into a <UNK> where they act like the insects eventually they die the hole takes place in a <UNK> apartment building which is especially well created kudos to the set designer its two protagonists live right above and below each other the woman is on the lower floor and the <UNK> above her apartment are <UNK> <UNK> threatening to destroy her food supply not to mention her sanity she calls a <UNK> to go check it out and he accidentally <UNK> a hole through the floor of the man's apartment the two have never met before and they come into contact through the hole br br the script is quite brilliant few films are simultaneously this funny while remaining completely human deeply exploring the human condition especially feelings of loneliness and despair <UNK> direction is simply beautiful like a lot of other <UNK> directors he uses a lot of long takes but unlike say <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't <UNK> them in fact i don't know if i've ever seen them used better they're always effective and never tedious br br it would be wrong to review this film without mentioning the musical numbers yes the hole is also a musical and a great one at that in the film's best scenes which is saying something considering how good all the other scenes are the man <UNK> that the woman is a singer almost a <UNK> singer these numbers are fully choreographed often with <UNK> dancers and singers in a stroke of genius <UNK> has these <UNK> produced numbers take place in the <UNK> building the signs of apocalypse and <UNK> this provides both a sense of pathos and absurdity br br the hole is a film that begs to be seen it ought to be a cult classic if nothing else before i went to see this i was told that it was a decent film but probably <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> least good one well if that is true i just cannot wait to see another one 10 10
<START> 2006 shown in the u s as the golden door was written and directed by <UNK> this film is different and i think better than most movies about <UNK> people who leave europe and come to the united states br br the film begins with scenes in a poor rural region of <UNK> we always hear that <UNK> is a rocky island but you won't really understand the <UNK> of that phrase until you see the first half hour of the golden door br br the middle section of the film is devoted to the long voyage to the u s most <UNK> films show us ten minutes of people in the third class section becoming <UNK> and then show us the statue of liberty not this movie we get a sense for life below <UNK> and it isn't charming we never actually see the statue of liberty either br br finally the typical movie will give us another ten minutes of <UNK> island and then the immigrants are walking through new <UNK> lower east side not here the <UNK> island experience <UNK> about one third of the footage br br vincenzo <UNK> is outstanding as <UNK> <UNK> who is bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world charlotte <UNK> is equally good as lucy reed a mysterious <UNK> who also speaks <UNK> italian br br there are some strange touches in the movie especially the sound track with songs by nina <UNK> there must be some symbolism there but i couldn't make sense of it br br another reviewer has already pointed out that this film will do better viewed in a theater rather than on dvd still large screen or small screen it's worth seeking out
<START> though some would prefer to comment on the value of bond movies in the connection of learning <UNK> and while most of the <UNK> that tends to limit bond to a <UNK> <UNK> following has been exploited beyond all reasonable <UNK> there are several redeeming that <UNK> the credibility of sean connery in this <UNK> role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by jessica <UNK> in driving miss daisy while connery had been less visible in the latter his woman <UNK> qualities had maybe not cast a <UNK> on the face of <UNK> <UNK> as it would in this latest rendition which to most involved approached the <UNK> theme with kind <UNK> albeit while the general flavor had been altered great for those who interest others while <UNK> to be who you're not
<START> i am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie br br i watched the film 9 years ago and i still remember how angry i felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess i am a big fan of john <UNK> work i really like his movies so i went to beyond with big expectations but i felt like watching a dumb cheap chuck norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out even the soundtrack was very annoying br br i can't believe that john <UNK> was the director because this movie was so badly done i think the <UNK> people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle
<START> when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie i was wrong all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others some are actually funny such as the first scary movie this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull br br i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they <UNK> fun at to many movies such as <UNK> blues friday night lights stick it etc and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one even the adult humor in this movie was dry do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don't rent this movie
<START> this film has recently been <UNK> by turner classic movies it may have been considered <UNK> in its time and may have made money but even the most die hard jane russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck br br there are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can <UNK> the test of time even though dated by current standards but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot the french line however fails at all of these aspects br br it doesn't matter that russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material the entire cast is dragged down by a boring trite plot and dialogue br br it's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers they're crummy
<START> i never intended to see <UNK> but i caught it on cable it does have good elements the <UNK> swamp atmosphere for one something we will unfortunately not see so much of in movies because of <UNK> <UNK> it is based on an interesting concept a regular man <UNK> with the spirits of evil his confrontation with his son could have been interesting as could much of the movie but as tends to happen in hollywood an interesting idea goes down a familiar direction br br kill off all the characters save the good girl starting with the black guys i'm a fan of <UNK> <UNK> but the other characters the <UNK> <UNK> mentioned son who must become a voodoo <UNK> are more interesting and for the love of god just once i would like to see the virgin get killed we all like the easy girl why can't she live in this case it was <UNK> phillips and we love her br br the ending made no sense considering what had been established about the <UNK> <UNK> all the carnage and atmosphere and it leads to nothing
<START> it is said that there are some people out there who actually admire movies well and why not <UNK> studios lived on a kind of cost plus basis cost plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of <UNK> every once in a while sure they're cheap but let's face it they're coarse fast <UNK> vulgar but <UNK> they have no <UNK> at all they're designed to <UNK> the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill so what if john wayne <UNK> through the wild west along a road <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> this isn't art it's entertainment br br take this movie flight to mars at the beginning when we're first meeting the characters a man might introduce his female companion abruptly avoiding any tedious subtlety professor this is my fiancée and assistant who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman she loves me but is growing <UNK> with me because i'm always wrapped up in my scientific work perhaps you could steal her from me marry her give her the babies and the <UNK> <UNK> home she <UNK> for if necessary i will die on this journey to see her dreams realized also she likes it a little rough it saves a lot of writing and shooting time doesn't it that's what people mean when they say a narrative is fast this one was shot in five days why should we have to hint about these things i mean what the hell is this a cheap sci fi movie or henry james actually this is a particularly well <UNK> example of a <UNK> movie it's in color for one thing to be exact you can tell it's not any other color you'd recognize and look at the cast the female lead is as is usual with <UNK> but the male leads are definitely up there on the b list cameron mitchell as the reporter yet to hit his <UNK> as a male lead which come to think of it he never really did and arthur <UNK> as the <UNK> smoking head scientist the pride of <UNK> new jersey and for science fiction fans how about this pair of <UNK> both morris and john <UNK> there's not really much point in describing the plot in detail the five crew members crash land on mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by <UNK> whose evolution was with <UNK> right down to their having five <UNK> and <UNK> babes in short <UNK> and they picked up english from listening to our <UNK> american <UNK> that is judging from their speech they're led by a sinister <UNK> who try to <UNK> the space ship build many <UNK> of it and <UNK> earth they do not succeed br br the special effects aren't very special the men walk around a couple of spare sets wearing black costumes with stylized lightning <UNK> <UNK> on their <UNK> and scarlet <UNK> <UNK> behind them their names consist exclusively of english the martian who falls for arthur <UNK> is named <UNK> with an <UNK> european <UNK> <UNK> and she already knows what kissing is br br overall i found it as snappy as it was intended to be but dull too the story is that of any buck rogers 1930s serial once the <UNK> and the martians meet and it's established that they have a common language and that the martians have a sinister agenda that's it in two hours even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of nazi spies in world war ii the plot is done by the numbers the dialog has no <UNK> the acting is pedestrian br br however dedicated <UNK> of <UNK> productions should enjoy it after all jean luc <UNK> the french <UNK> dedicated a bout de <UNK> to <UNK> so they can't have been all that bad
<START> the stars and the planets must've all been in just the proper <UNK> the day that thriller was conceived michael jackson's album was <UNK> the <UNK> john <UNK> still had a lot of good will built up from his genre <UNK> an american werewolf in london not to mention his classic comedies animal house and the blues brothers and choreographer michael peters was creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos of that period br br not before or since has one single piece of film <UNK> exploited or <UNK> <UNK> incredible talent or the more <UNK> aspects of his persona quite like thriller the world's most successful if not officially the first long form video and the most <UNK> remembered also the most expensive at the time but every penny and every bit of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen and how would it not be complete without the rap from the original song provided by the late great vincent price to add even more <UNK> to the chills already there br br the glory days of one of the world's greatest performers have long since passed but no one can ever take away the man's <UNK> achievements of which this is probably the most memorable if you don't think so now remember halloween is coming i won't be one bit surprised when like other before it going back decades this appears on some saturday night creature feature special br br as it will next year and the year after that
<START> i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful aside from the <UNK> quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point i'm only commenting b c of another comment i saw here that said it was great wow maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available br br the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing br br i guess if you were very into the whole area <UNK> and understood some of the nuances other comments reference it may be good but for me the average joe i don't get it
<START> although it isn't mentioned very often don't look in the basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch the story follows a young nurse charlotte <UNK> who is hired at <UNK> <UNK> to replace dr <UNK> after he is murdered by a patient many patients begin to torment miss <UNK> and her boss dr <UNK> masters acts as if she's hiding something br br this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesn't happen very often in horror films the musical score is great and is reminiscent of dark shadows the performance from <UNK> <UNK> mcadams and bill are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending this movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film i have ever seen has been able to capture many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic don't look in the basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive in films
<START> the movie night crossing captures the feelings experienced by the vast majority of east germans during the period <UNK> <UNK> i lived in west berlin during most of 1967 and <UNK> through the wall into east berlin on a weekly basis why excitement crossing a border into a soviet <UNK> country experiencing the <UNK> and the feel of east germany which is why night crossing is excellent it captures that very feeling and it is exciting i was arrested by the in <UNK> charlie and <UNK> by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses i am led to believe was <UNK> when i watch the movie i can smell cheap <UNK> and cooking oil i can see the outdated vehicles the drab clothing the public wore and the <UNK> produce in shop windows it brings back memories of <UNK> just how lucky i was to live in a free country in 1988 i <UNK> the <UNK> from east to west north to south east germany had changed little since 1967 the constantly breaking down were still the main mode of private <UNK> transport the <UNK> still featured nothing much to <UNK> me uniforms were still <UNK> but the people the ordinary people were open and nice once you had gained their trust watch night crossing it's as close to the truth as any movie you will see on divided germany even closer than two other favourites the spy who came in from the cold and funeral in berlin
<START> a formulaic story with all the tired cliches i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie what a waste how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced br br at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot br br oh and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the <UNK> cop who can barely move a finger yeah right i can buy that what next fingers porn
<START> a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth when they <UNK> her poem from a video game supposedly representing a <UNK> the only one who dies in the game is miller adam goldberg who also is found dead the same way he <UNK> in said video game while the <UNK> characters didn't die in the video game their <UNK> her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them one by one they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat and save their skin br br if this premise sound stupid that's because it is the characters are ho hum rejects from bad wb television shows this time allowed to <UNK> profanity this flick follows the slasher rules but doesn't show much violence or gore it stays pg 13 safe with most of the death taking place off screen there's a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them yes it's that bad nothing at all to recommend good looking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october
<START> this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival it's american title apparently is <UNK> spring the acting is superb the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and <UNK> it up a little bit <UNK> by his best friend and partner in not so serious crime he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold his wife has come to her wits end and makes a life changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch the resolution of the story is beautiful
<START> before the <UNK> became cartoon with hulk leading the way the events of <UNK> tv <UNK> of the very early 1980s <UNK> the wild wild west with all kinds of <UNK> and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the <UNK> that are known today to be the most beloved stars some of these seemingly very real moments stand out a <UNK> sgt slaughter whipped then champion bob with a riding crop after showed him up in a <UNK> test were all over <UNK> made the iron <UNK> look like a <UNK> <UNK> slaughter also <UNK> a challenge to anyone who could break his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hold this led a legendary and bloody alley match with <UNK> pat <UNK> hall of fame member <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> came into the <UNK> with a claw hold that was <UNK> on television he claimed he was the true giant at and challenged andre long before big john in 1984 adrian <UNK> used his <UNK> named good night irene sleeper to take out the competition a new <UNK> clad in black leather he was an ominous figure george the animal steele was far from a crowd <UNK> as well even jimmy <UNK> was a <UNK> sight as he set out opponents until ray the stevens delivered a <UNK> onto the <UNK> floor leaving <UNK> a bloody mess all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of
<START> during university our philosophy professor mr r played us roger me in its entirety this was at a time when the <UNK> <UNK> was still pretty much unknown a <UNK> in the making a soon to be household name who was still busy <UNK> his fact <UNK> skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed the <UNK> paranoid the mentally ill the sexually frustrated the illiterate the semi <UNK> the clueless and the laughably <UNK> among <UNK> br br as we finished viewing it i thought yeah it was somewhat entertaining in a totally <UNK> bugs bunny kind of way but what an ultra biased anti <UNK> propaganda turkey that has no <UNK> whatsoever this is its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet <UNK> for this isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination however our beloved <UNK> professor was absolutely thrilled with r m and we ended up not only not <UNK> any aspects of it but mr r actually spent the remainder of class <UNK> its qualities just so we understand each other the words propaganda viewer manipulation left wing <UNK> or <UNK> fact presentation never <UNK> his <UNK> smiling mouth and just to remind you this was supposed to be a philosophy class not <UNK> your students with your own political b s course br br anyway now i get to the really interesting aspect this professor mr r is now a highly successful screenwriter in hollywood he has written several left wing scripts with a grade stars in them br br the moral of the story those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in hollywood br br michael moore is a talentless filmmaker which he proved beyond a <UNK> of a doubt with canadian bacon but being a <UNK> liberal opens doors to just about anyone <UNK> is <UNK> with <UNK> pro chavez <UNK> hence why political <UNK> through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part and <UNK> of the hollywood experience for many decades now br br embrace this <UNK> and you've betrayed your own brain forever
<START> nothing will ever top <UNK> with the lovely jill <UNK> as a shrink but ain't quite as bad as i expected for a <UNK> channel <UNK> just make sure to watch it while drunk or stoned or while trying to go to sleep the unimaginative title basically says it all a group of mostly unknown actors <UNK> on an island where a government experiment to grow giant <UNK> has gone wrong giant creatures that came into contact with the <UNK> have taken over the island and eaten everyone so now the government is preparing to blow up the island regardless of the people being there the acting is wonderfully atrocious especially a <UNK> general right out of the incredible hulk tv series but this is typical of this kind of made for cable schlock the cgi creatures are tv level quality which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters however two of the <UNK> in the group are very cute and worth watching as they run here and there in their tight little outfits you just want to eat them up
<START> my <UNK> for this review i own all the alien and predator movies i have and have read almost all the books i can find that are related to this series br br i can safely say this movie is a stinker save your money don't waste your time if you like mindless action mindless gore no plot to speak of like being taken by hollywood see the movie br br if you are a serious alien series fan send a message to the over stuffed over paid suits in hollywood 20th century fox don't give them a penny br br this movie has so many plot holes in it you could <UNK> <UNK> through it read the other negative reviews to get the big picture it has all be said accurately so i don't have to repeat them br br the characters in this movie are cardboard you want them all dead and the movie doesn't disappoint almost all of them die even the hot bubble headed blond do you feel sorry for her nope no plot no character development who cares the <UNK> are now idiots too they <UNK> everything but their own dead warrior they are suppose to be a high technology society right in the predator movie they <UNK> the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed <UNK> kills in they <UNK> charles and let him go because he had cancer major plot hole br br also the r rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face <UNK> lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is <UNK> with chest she is <UNK> by the hybrid alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth to mouth love scene orgy and they all <UNK> in say 30 seconds sensational gore a plenty nothing more these scenes are laughable not serious it is almost like the violence happens and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause a thumbs up or a nod of some sort br br the aliens in this movie are all on performance <UNK> drugs they develop fast and spread quickly all over the town tons of them everywhere in record <UNK> time pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the aliens aliens predator continuity br br i have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore laughable as a movie as a <UNK> of the aliens franchise and the development of the aliens vs predator franchise this movie is a <UNK> cliché at best if you have <UNK> followed this series all the rules are broken and the aliens and <UNK> are reduced to comic book characters br br there is not one fantastic memorable action scene there are almost no special effects worth remembering there are no brand name actors the plot is as thin as <UNK> paper that ultimately ends with a we have two choices to get out of this mess the hospital or the center of town i just about wet myself the center of town means everyone is going to get <UNK> by big brother who somehow knows the town has been <UNK> because they have an in the air that can see the <UNK> on a radar screen in special effects red spots i just about fell out of my chair special effects red spot alien radar on an over middle america i am splitting my gut laughing br br having to get to the helicopter pad made me choke on my popcorn has anyone played a game called zombies you have to get your playing pieces to the helicopter pad to win i almost wet myself laughing br br the ending is enough to make you shake your head in <UNK> who did 20th century fox hire to write this script oh oh ask me a grade 5 student there really can't be any other answer oh yes there can be another answer low budget <UNK> sci fi br br the ending <UNK> stevens takes the predator pulse rifle to ms <UNK> <UNK> she tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents <UNK> stevens knows doesn't want the technology to use on earth you are kidding me right ms who is ms the corporation she is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet in her <UNK> far east wisdom she says the world is not ready for the technology seriously the brothers <UNK> as directors who is responsible for this <UNK> abortion of a movie they are the doug and bob <UNK> of directors and yet fox <UNK> the <UNK> alien franchise to them they are <UNK> as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects hmmm i see a pattern laughable br br this movie is only made to empty your <UNK> it serves no other purpose it has no plot it has no main characters worth mentioning it is disjointed it does not <UNK> to any of the character principles established in previous movies it does nothing to advance the franchise the special effects are lame minimal and low budget and it has no ending to speak of it is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money nothing more br br save your money either watch it on tv where it will very quickly end up buy a <UNK> or miss this bleeding altogether there is a reason why fox did not preview this movie to the critics the critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it jr <UNK> the original creator is at this very moment <UNK> over a toilet <UNK> his lunch br br 20th century fox this movie is a stinker it is as bad or worse than alien 3 you insult us br br <UNK> now
<START> this movie really sucks br br just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this <UNK> about a nice girl joan <UNK> who gets involved with the <UNK> because she needs money and because she's too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her alan <UNK> was supposed to be the star of this thing but he's nowhere to be found for the first freaking half hour and when he does show up he stands around like a <UNK> <UNK> a real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable as well as stupid characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody like really fast br br bring a <UNK>
<START> after traveling around the world it <UNK> on me that australia really lacks one thing that other countries have history br br fortunately or unfortunately australia wasn't establish following a war it has not had a civil war and most of its political history is rather boring nothing big happened to mark some sort of turning point in <UNK> history until the <UNK> of the government by the <UNK> general of australia john kerr br br for those who are australian you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next this is for the benefit of curious non <UNK> australia was <UNK> by the british as time went on it became apparent that australia was capable of standing on its own two feet <UNK> the uk granted australia <UNK> to establish its own laws <UNK> and so on the law and politics of australia would no longer be provided directly from the british rather australia would be run by <UNK> in their own right even though the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and so on is largely <UNK> on the british system this shift was in the australian <UNK> despite the fact that the <UNK> <UNK> australian <UNK> law making <UNK> <UNK> but for those who are curious no bill of rights their are two pro crown sections that were included and remain there to this day these are more or less regarded as the <UNK> powers of the crown king queen of great britain the first group of sections relates to the creation of the office of the <UNK> general briefly the <UNK> general is considered the <UNK> chief representative in australia and is described as the executive branch of the australian government when a piece of law is passed by the australian <UNK> the <UNK> states that it only becomes law when it is signed by the <UNK> general as such the general is regarded by some as nothing more than a rubber <UNK> performing an <UNK> and unnecessary <UNK> function on behalf of the crown <UNK> the <UNK> general can refuse to sign a law passed by australian <UNK> if he thinks fit for instance if <UNK> passed a law which allows the police to shoot dead any australian over the age of 50 <UNK> of course then the <UNK> could refuse to sign it and it would not become the law of the land however this power is <UNK> and has to date never been <UNK> by convention which is the buzz word of the events leading to the <UNK> the <UNK> general virtually acts at the <UNK> of the australian government and therefore if the government passes law and the prime minister <UNK> the <UNK> general to sign it he will almost always without question in fact by convention the <UNK> general acts in <UNK> with the advice provided to him by the prime minister of the day and the prime minister alone the second aspect is section 64 of the <UNK> which states that the government <UNK> hold office at the <UNK> <UNK> pleasure now the events of 1975 covered in this film gave rise to a <UNK> on this particular section if the <UNK> general is somehow with the government and or prime minister it would appear that this section allows him to sack the government which happened in 1975 hence the title of the film the <UNK> whether <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> can be <UNK> as the <UNK> right to dismiss is a <UNK> point though that led to rather <UNK> <UNK> amongst <UNK> at the time especially considering that the <UNK> general is not elected by the people of australia br br now that this background aspect is out of the way let's get back to discussing the film it was well made the pace was patient but didn't drag at all the drama was well contained and very realistic it didn't over the events and most importantly it did not present its point of view from one political perspective on the contrary i felt that it was fair and balanced even though <UNK> text before the credits <UNK> that the film makers probably didn't <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> decision to dismiss the government but i wouldn't describe the film overall as bias in one direction or the other br br in terms of accuracy it was virtually spot on the film makers certainly did their <UNK> and evidently read the books and <UNK> from all the principle players concerned there were a number of <UNK> details that were somewhat <UNK> over largely because they took a long time to explain and ultimately had little impact on the events of 1975 so i forgive them for that further i think it was difficult to recreate the public sentiment of that post vietnam war era but pretty much pulled it off br br finally i was pleased that the film attempted to raise individual <UNK> of both sides without becoming <UNK> obsessive or <UNK> over them moreover any that we're raised for example <UNK> <UNK> had a great deal of relevance to the story the film makers realised that their task was to tell the story of the events leading to the <UNK> and not to present a political <UNK> or opposition in relation to <UNK> and <UNK> this was smart because it meant that the film can't be accused of one <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> is probably the most incredible piece of political history that has occurred in australia in its short life i am glad that it has been <UNK> in celluloid essential viewing for any australian
<START> <UNK> trek is clearly a film that is <UNK> of even an el <UNK> level budget 7 000 still the creators are able to pull off decent effects at times often due to great editing such as the the situations aboard the cat ship and slim t unique way of <UNK> with his ship without use of a traditional communication device br br the acting does have its rough spots but the portrayal of <UNK> is excellent and <UNK> is certainly not too hard on the eyes br br i do wish that the film had been longer than its <UNK> hour and that should be seen as a compliment this movie is a success due to the sincerity and hard work of those involved
<START> a twist of fate puts a black man at the head of an old school white <UNK> advertising firm and he <UNK> to make a few changes br br one very strange piece of cinema you'll either love it or hate it either way you've never seen anything like it
<START> the worst film ever made bar none give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it except for the bit where the hard luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should that's all
<START> a film of high intelligence and activity as well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60's the film is also truly a surprise in its forward thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group william <UNK> <UNK> himself to the <UNK> role in the group he asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming first the two actors then the crew filming the actors then the entire set including <UNK> policemen and finally a homeless man whose been living in <UNK> in central park for 9 weeks br br <UNK> edits the film thousands of feet together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations don't expect to be bored by this film each of crew make for engaging and often times are <UNK> the thoughts that the <UNK> has watching this film <UNK> does well at <UNK> the multiple camera takes using <UNK> three in one pictures and other attention shifting methods br br in the end the film will really only be effective if it's what you're looking for if you're looking for some abstract arty film that <UNK> your own self indulgent ego while never having a point look elsewhere if you're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented reality and the inevitable <UNK> that comes of it then this is the perfect film
<START> i was very surprised to learn that goldie hawn won an oscar for this film she seemed very lifeless and completely <UNK> by the <UNK> year old bergman in the scenes where they are side by side if it had been written today i think that bergman and the young man <UNK> would have wound up together ingrid is so much <UNK> than goldie and the two self absorbed characters played by matthau and hawn would be left out in the cold but it was written at the end of 60's and feels like <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> in the park however <UNK> one liners <UNK> innocence and <UNK> classy performance make this quite pleasant to watch
<START> ah how refreshing to see a vision of 18th century england complete with mud the <UNK> and and accompanied by a delightful <UNK> soundtrack to boot this is the story of <UNK> <UNK> robert <UNK> and gentleman fallen on hard times captain <UNK> lee miller and how they get together and rob the pigs is a hard nut but is far too polite for that and thus becomes 'the gentleman he falls in love with lady rebecca <UNK> tyler who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole <UNK> and wants to impress her br br the costumes are fantastic big colourful historically beautiful <UNK> alan <UNK> gets all the best threads and the best lines as lord rochester sporting a very non 18th century <UNK> <UNK> the music shifts between <UNK> glorious <UNK> and <UNK> bass laden <UNK> which doesn't as you think it should do in a historical film the script is fast moving and <UNK> with modern day <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this is not there are hilarious parts disgusting parts sit on the edge of your seat and <UNK> your <UNK> parts but the whole thing <UNK> along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout this is cheer in the cinema stuff <UNK>
<START> truly unique and stunning film of jules <UNK> for the flag by the czech master director <UNK> <UNK> although the story is <UNK> in a rather understated late victorian style the visuals are a <UNK> <UNK> uses animation graphics painted sets model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of <UNK> that the reader associates in his mind the style resembles the steel of <UNK> and <UNK> and that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of georges <UNK> added photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a saturday morning variety there are underwater sequences where the <UNK> swimming about are so accurately drawn they can be used in a field guide there are images of ships <UNK> flying craft <UNK> and <UNK> that are drawn in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his vcr or dvd to pause the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production the late victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made <UNK> the great father of the genre if this is not enough there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci fi film truly a forgotten classic this one is worth hunting down and buying always one of my favorite films of all times it is sure to be one of yours too and remember this was done decades before cgi or computer animation kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it it shows jules <UNK> himself would be proud of this movie a film that deserves to be better known but those who have seen it love it and treasure it an outstanding achievement this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it a true cinematic work of art from a <UNK> director
<START> i have been watching lost with my family since the first episode it used to be great the last season it was very disappointing it seems as if they writers don't know what to do with the show so they keep trying to make it up for it by <UNK> one story line in a whole episode the present season which by the way i decided to keep watching only to see <UNK> and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better has been one disappointment after another my husband and son even stopped watching first of all he only appears for 30 seconds in each episode but the real problem is with the story line there is nothing really happening each episode could be shown in 15 minutes we watch each episode waiting for something that never happens i am not asking that every secret be revealed at once but how about some variation in the story lines in the first and second seasons we had different story lines we saw the characters history a little action a little romance now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to <UNK> it is almost <UNK> to watch it when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time now it is important to note that the actors still great i can't believe they killed mr <UNK> he was great jack <UNK> fox is still incredible the perfect hero so kind <UNK> brave <UNK> josh <UNK> the bad boy is kind of because of kate <UNK> but that's cool i miss <UNK> andrews sun and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kim daniel kim they are all an important part of the plot or should be but we barely see them i hope <UNK> <UNK> will have a big part on the show if not why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show access hollywood etc sorry if i've been <UNK> for too long but i feel cheated by this show when i started watching it was great i got used to it and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going i'll be here hoping for the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i've just watched this again on the bbc channel 4 it's not jane <UNK> best novel by any means but the film is a reasonable interpretation i suspect the <UNK> rooms at bath would have been rather more crowded than shown perhaps they couldn't afford the extras also why does everyone shut up so that the dancing couple can have an <UNK> conversation i've never heard anything anyone has ever said to me when i've been dancing and i suspect it would have been the same in the 18 19th century in bath br br i cannot believe the us canada reviews they completely miss the ironic element that is in the film throughout the gothic scenes are quite cleverly presented but you need to read them properly i'm sure jane a would be mildly amused by those reviews a of nothing does anyone else think that peter <UNK> gets to look more like colin baker a former doctor who or vice versa the older they both get
<START> there is no fun <UNK> fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants or the desperate plight of head shop owners for that matter that the <UNK> than god brian didn't see the irony of having the heroes do exactly what the villain does rob honest <UNK> people of their life <UNK> doesn't surprise me hell how do you think he got to be <UNK> than god br br in this alleged satire about greed these mental <UNK> reveal their own <UNK> the the the the who are paid <UNK> to take care of the the and the but the main problem aside from the revolting <UNK> is the premise as the former executive of a now infamous company dick would be the big <UNK> for every corporate in the country no soup <UNK> for him and <UNK> in high six figures you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore poster
<START> piece of junk would've given it a 0 if i could have animation is good but not quite good enough storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i've ever come across and that's saying a lot this <UNK> tried so hard to be interesting but failed miserably it's almost as if the writer started one story then got another idea and attempted to <UNK> the two together don't waste your time on this believe me you'll be as <UNK> off with yourself as i was the only actor of any note in this was james woods and his part was <UNK> at best i'm all for doing stuff that is edgy that pushes the <UNK> but this simply didn't cut it
<START> the <UNK> review says that <UNK> <UNK> character is taut and frustrated and later that she could be the sister of character in ordinary people say what no way this lady was quirky from the start nothing like <UNK> in ordinary people sorry br br next the <UNK> goes on to say that <UNK> <UNK> sandy travis and jeff <UNK> ben travis are 40 something year olds children of the 60s ms weaver must be dancing a <UNK> i believe at the time she made imaginary heroes she was in fact <UNK> years old she was born in 1949 br br <UNK> perception <UNK> aside this was a pretty good movie considering it was made by someone so young obviously <UNK> weaver thought so and so did jeff daniels the young man playing tim was outstanding br br there are some critical comments i could make about the script such as that i never really got a good sense of why sandy travis missed her son her sort of blown apart behavior was perhaps <UNK> by his death but that such behavior lasted <UNK> of the way through the film i felt had more to do with her <UNK> marriage her relationship with tim and where he really came from and other <UNK> issues than from any mourning of her elder son ben's mourning was much more clear br br so matt travis was an <UNK> did his mom think so too still a very watchable film what is becoming <UNK> and <UNK> is not that there are no roles for women over a certain age rather that what it takes is a director such as this one to be so clearly in love with an older woman ms weaver and to almost make his film an homage to her sort of an anti woody allen
<START> <UNK> to christina <UNK> for making this movie and putting her <UNK> behind this important subject and trying to make a great film <UNK> is my favorite actress she is so gifted so natural her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly <UNK> which gives <UNK> to the often term star br br the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming to the screen in making it a compelling narrative more on that later the cast at first glance is excellent but come to think of it jessica lang as the jewish mother is too <UNK> and not exactly right ann doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book and when your making a movie how can you justify saying no to anne <UNK> and jessica lange but the real problems are in the film's construction first in the failure to <UNK> any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth character and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in br br unfortunately do to the flashback construction <UNK> merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most but not nearly as <UNK> ill as she comes off in the book this is a major problem this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the <UNK> couch she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors both society and the home and this is a crucial point in not only <UNK> the proper sympathy for her but also of the <UNK> of her case she is so talented and such a vulnerable and <UNK> spirit so early on that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her <UNK> this is missed on the film br br ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say it is a biopic of one severely affected girl but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at <UNK> are even more messed up than the average college the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across <UNK> and that's too bad is <UNK> a good thing or is it a bad thing or a mixed <UNK> or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical <UNK> these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way the <UNK> disaster is an interesting image to <UNK> a dysfunctional america but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the <UNK> and <UNK> earlier development of controlling themes br br <UNK> performance is tight and heartfelt and one of the best of her acting career br br <UNK> williams is also superb in her role
<START> by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life i watch practically every movie that is on at night either showtime hbo <UNK> etc three aka survivor island keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie i must have screamed at a minimum <UNK> times from the idiotic twists if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down br br in my personal opinion i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals
<START> in the <UNK> <UNK> david jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as <UNK> not <UNK> your set ' at and the <UNK> series it was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role in london weekend <UNK> 'the top secret life of edgar <UNK> written by richard bernard <UNK> br br edgar <UNK> is a secret agent of the 's i <UNK> intelligence <UNK> he genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up astonishingly enough though he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases much to the <UNK> of his colleagues michael <UNK> mark <UNK> and the lovely <UNK> all of which answer to 'the <UNK> coleman br br <UNK> is married to barbara <UNK> a woman who much like <UNK> from <UNK> mother's do 'em ' has the patience of a saint and stands by her <UNK> <UNK> but well meaning husband no matter what br br like <UNK> mother's do and 'the <UNK> man' <UNK> t s l o e <UNK> was laced completely with slapstick each episode saw jason perform stunts such as <UNK> from a high window <UNK> or falling from the top of a ladder while <UNK> his flat it was pie in the <UNK> stuff really br br <UNK> was not a big hit due to poor <UNK> from i t v a shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show well served by its star and the fine support cast the leading man though did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show david jason repeat <UNK> of the show because he felt his acting in it was non <UNK> granted the david jason who played <UNK> and is way different to the one that played <UNK> but by no means was his acting <UNK> most actors would have turned <UNK> into a ridiculous caricature but <UNK> performance made <UNK> a credible realistic figure odd perhaps but not <UNK> br br <UNK> next vehicle was <UNK> in which he played <UNK> boy it too failed to make the ratings his lucky break came in the shape of a t 'a sharp <UNK> of in which he played walking disaster area for four series between 1977 1981 so while not outstanding as such is an easy and worthwhile watch nice <UNK> style theme tune too
<START> this was one of the few shows that my wife and i agreed on watching i was upset to hear that it was canceled especially because i didn't realize the ratings were so poor as far as i knew it was doing very well with a lot of viewers almost all my friends and most of the people i spoke to watched the show now we are stuck watching either crappy shows or dvd's how bad was the show doing does anyone know the real results of the shows viewings i know that when it went to <UNK> it was more difficult for me to catch thank g d for br br anyways this was a real surprise to know that there will be no more the war at home if any other networks see this please pick up the show please
<START> before i start i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion love them i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like i am very <UNK> of the horror genre one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ed wood where ed wood johnny <UNK> freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on plan <UNK> cheap sets and continuity problems you don't know anything haven't you ever heard of of disbelief ' well i try to bring that suspension of disbelief philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works unfortunately it didn't work for me during the screening of <UNK> massacre br br strike one br br the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand held home digital camera style the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime <UNK> look breathtaking in comparison in fact it makes troma and full moon video releases look good and that's bad br br strike two br br jim <UNK> this filmmaker probably <UNK> himself a chip off the ol' corman but nothing could be further from the truth roger corman shot fast furious and under budget but was able to deliver a tight original film though <UNK> delivers a cheap film he <UNK> his viewers and perhaps other artists as he steals entire pieces of james <UNK> <UNK> from the deep and battle beyond the stars musical scores and <UNK> drops them into <UNK> massacre on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is <UNK> attributed to dan an extra in deathstalker ii you will also notice how <UNK> massacre jumps from video to film and back again as <UNK> lifts entire scenes from both <UNK> party massacre and <UNK> from the deep <UNK> <UNK> this deception <UNK> years earlier in his horrible version of not of this earth br br strike three you're out br br while <UNK> massacre does have some nudity 40 year olds playing teenagers and the <UNK> set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film ugh the murders are relatively <UNK> what the heck is that all about the film is titled <UNK> massacre but a handful of off screen killings in my opinion does not add up to a massacre it doesn't even add up to a bad <UNK> bite br br the film's story is fair enough unseen killer stalks a <UNK> of <UNK> old <UNK> playing teens until the van runs out of gas and the girls are forced to hold up in secluded two story mountain home i won't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those films where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer <UNK> massacre would have been great if it were shot on film directed by joseph and had special effects by tom <UNK> instead it is an effect less shot on video travesty by jim <UNK> <UNK> br br i beg of you please don't buy or rent this abomination if we keep supporting these <UNK> the more of this talentless video garbage they'll produce go out and rent the <UNK> the last house on dead end street <UNK> or the burning instead you'll be glad you did
<START> was in the mood for a french film and saw this at blockbuster what a little gem it turned out to be not sure how i missed all these years but he is fantastic such innocence and grace i love his face and the way he moves isabelle <UNK> was hilarious reminded me of nicole <UNK> over the top performance in <UNK> <UNK> she looks the same as 20 years ago truly remarkable gerard depardieu has not held up nearly as well but his acting continues to <UNK> he's perfect in this film will probably buy this one i enjoyed it so much if you want to see another great french movie rent <UNK> stunning
<START> when the legends die is a powerful moving story of an <UNK> <UNK> indian who goes on to become tom black bull a champion rider raised in the old ways tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world bitter about the role he has been forced into tom finds <UNK> doing one thing <UNK> horses riding them to death in the <UNK> the movie has richard widmark in the role of red the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story which is about where the movie ends the real story is completely ignored the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the <UNK> <UNK> oh well you should read the book this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice
<START> the only thing it has to offer is the interesting <UNK> of and jack their choices and <UNK> and the philosophical questions that it raises feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die and jack feels that they are supposed to die and she is messing with plan or the plan or such <UNK> br br but she is obviously able to change things so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the <UNK> <UNK> jack has no basis for believing that there is and very conveniently never asks him the right questions nobody does which obviously proves that the makers of the series don't have an answer br br there simply is no plot br br instead they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with it's boring girl stuff only occasionally interrupted by and jack's racing against each other towards ends that are unknown br br it turns out that there is nothing to any of it a teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else br br your time will be better spent sleeping
<START> let's face it a truly awful movie no i mean a truly awful movie is a rare strange and beautiful thing to behold i that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space half <UNK> species etc and although i'm giving this film a 1 i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is a bad film to find a friend <UNK> something to drink and make the special occasion it deserves out of aussie park <UNK> br br from the very first moments of the lead actor's side to side eye rolling performance as he attempts to <UNK> intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures eat your heart out <UNK> <UNK> to the sudden hey we're out of film conclusion you will not stop laughing br br to sum the film up its a poor man's warriors down under complete and that description alone should be enough but then comes the wonders of the spaghetti eating scene the <UNK> got their tickets they won't be leaving town <UNK> scene it's the <UNK> run and more the only truly <UNK> part is a <UNK> filmed rape outside of this i dare you to watch this film and i dare you to find evidence of acting or lines or direction or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so called critics say a film needs to be judged as good br br if this movie doesn't cause fits of <UNK> laughter before it ends all i can do is roll my eyes <UNK> from side to side at you and shout you dog you dog you dog
<START> sometimes the academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films or doesn't <UNK> them because they are controversial or strong sometimes they are nominated but don't win anything i hope this doesn't happen this year with american beauty this is exactly what happened with boogie nights which was the best film of 1997 the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to titanic a purely commercial and hollow film and other awards to the overrated good will hunting and the irritating full monty the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were l a <UNK> and as good as it gets great movies but boogie nights is still better and should have been remembered in more categories br br this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams mark <UNK> in a surprisingly great performance a 17 year old <UNK> who takes the attention of jack <UNK> burt reynolds in a redeeming acting a director of porn films eddie has a special <UNK> and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies he changes his name for <UNK> <UNK> and starts to make a huge success but fame doesn't last forever other characters also have their parallel stories <UNK> waves <UNK> moore perfect buck don cheadle and others including heather graham an actress who accepts to do anything but she has to be wearing her roller shoes br br what could have been a banal trivial film turns into a perfect memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson what makes boogie nights such a great film is its execution added to a clever well written screenplay great soundtrack etc each character is very well developed and each of them has his her importance in the context each feeling weakness fear emotion is explored resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema br br boogie nights is a strong <UNK> picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema under a plot that seems banal at first impression there is a wonderful story of <UNK> and downs things that we face in our lives it is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s exactly an age of <UNK> and downs that's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece br br 10 10
<START> this movie was just horrendous how could anybody like this movie and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes this was just awful it never had its moments if it paid homage to 1980's airplane it needs to pay some more awful acting terrible script writing even for a movie with <UNK> or tom arnold this movie was bad from the beginning but people might have seen the whole thing by the thought that the plane would crash one of the worse movies ever stay away
<START> the most spiritual film i have seen in a long long time maybe ever also one scene around the <UNK> room table a piece of comic perfection i understand a release date is coming up in the fall if it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that makes you think this is it is great in it and she is most certainly a future star <UNK> is out now which she is in also all the actors seem perfectly <UNK> there is a tone set by this movie that is used to surprise through out i would not know what to call it it is comedy but the message is so fierce and direct that comedy is not a big enough word for it i love this film it is a thinking man's comedy but even that phrase is not really good enough does have a message and that message needs to be heard right now
<START> working in a music store my first <UNK> me this soundtrack the music of this movie is perfect one of my favorite <UNK> only years later i saw the movie i was afraid it would not fulfill my high expectations luckily it did a feel good romantic love story
<START> warning contains mild spoiler a movie almost designed to make you pause and check your <UNK> of it it's confined to an almost empty motel where the huge <UNK> resembles a circus ring and the rooms seem like temporary <UNK> points rather than <UNK> as the characters become increasingly <UNK> by the past the present increasingly falls away until the ultimate <UNK> appearance of the <UNK> in the black <UNK> marks the <UNK> of reality and fantasy whether or not their stories are true and whether <UNK> is truly the father or just a crazy old man stepping into their stories seems impossible to determine the theme seems to be how love of an extreme and <UNK> nature <UNK> with <UNK> to the point where reality itself breaks down where exotic misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously <UNK> the image of the burning motel a symbol of <UNK> <UNK> by destruction is an appropriately weird ending for this strange but effective <UNK> imaginative movie
<START> aside from the <UNK> scene i felt the movie was a waste of celluloid robert duvall kevin <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> could have played those roles in their sleep the dialog was <UNK> tolerable and there was plenty of it no one sat together quietly in this movie the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to <UNK> into the story there was no subtlety at all <UNK> hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story i think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything and the editing really needed <UNK> up each actor's screen time was more <UNK> than quality again too much dialog br br the entire story took place over the course of a few days but everything that happened took on epic proportions much like how day to day happenings seemed huge to you in high school but in the grand scheme really weren't that important yes the bad guys beat up and killed they beat up button they killed the dog all things which would get boss and blood up but the importance was <UNK> by all of the deep meaningful conversations which dominated most of the movie these guys worked together for 10 years and they're just now talking about this stuff the only time there wasn't much dialog was in the <UNK> scene which is probably why i liked it br br finally someone give <UNK> <UNK> a the <UNK> <UNK> of hair around her face that were i suppose to make her look a bit more romantic actually made her look a little deranged if she worked outside the home it would have made more sense plus why wasn't she married already there seemed to be several kind and gentle her words single men in town aside from the <UNK> and his <UNK> in fact none of the bad guys seemed to want her either a usual plot device in other movies she stayed <UNK> up in the house most of the time and really didn't seem to have much connection to the people in town makes you wonder br br in all the movie was entirely too long too <UNK> and too contrived for me it felt like a star vehicle with lots of screen time for the big stars but not enough character depth to interest me despite all of the dialog
<START> this was the film that first <UNK> to me what a great actor martin sheen really is he <UNK> claims that charlie is a better actor charlie can't hold a candle to him br br i found it suspenseful and thoroughly enjoyed the <UNK> of the love story with the main plot and i usually hate love stories there's a great plot twist at the end that struck me as being fully credible particularly in the early 80's time period and probably now also br br the final scene had me on the edge of my seat this film <UNK> illustrates that <UNK> is often <UNK> out by those we trust while <UNK> enemies have more in common than they suspect and finally that human compassion can be found where we least expect it br br
<START> a very funny look at some of <UNK> current affairs and political goings on the <UNK> boys really seem to have fun with this show and what i enjoy is that they all have their strengths some are brilliant at making complete idiots of themselves whereas julian can pull off the whole i'm <UNK> a famous politician and i'm about to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam type of humour br br they have great segments in the show taking the mick out of all sorts of aspects of australian culture such as our current affairs shows our <UNK> and early morning tv <UNK> some material is a bit tired and predictable but overall it's a lot of fun to watch and will leave you with a smile on your face
<START> what about dj cash money this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s there was only a small mention of dj cheese in <UNK> br br also it's not
<START> martin <UNK> seems to be a director who was always interested in social issues as the son of immigrants he had every <UNK> to be so especially since he was <UNK> in the <UNK> is based on pat <UNK> novel the water is wide about his own experience in 1969 teaching a school of <UNK> black children about the outside world much to the <UNK> of the right wing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what added to the movie's strength was the cultural and historical context <UNK> jon voight tells another teacher how many of the children don't know about paul newman sidney <UNK> the vietnam war or even where vietnam is he proceeds to <UNK> them about all these factors br br somewhere i read a complaint that when <UNK> played music for the children he only played white music the truth is you can't blame the movie for that it was based on <UNK> real experience either way the movie's a real gem
<START> <UNK> state is an interesting show for most <UNK> <UNK> i enjoy watching what the team has to say and what they find however i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses i <UNK> feel as i watch it that i am not watching non fiction but an actual movie that is <UNK> to reality i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare <UNK> br br interesting show stick to ghost hunters
<START> most people will consider that <UNK> greatest performance was as the <UNK> of <UNK> in the king and i certainly it gave him a wide variety of <UNK> to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to <UNK> to hateful it also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer finally as it was also his tony award winning performance from broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great broadway performance as well br br but he did other movies that showed his talents as well as the king and i his comic turn in once more with feeling was quite nice so was his performance as general in <UNK> or his in the ten <UNK> yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s <UNK> to eric von <UNK> as the man you love to hate a certain vulnerability in his acting and roles <UNK> him to the movie public even after his best years as a star were behind him and he <UNK> more and more to repeating the king of <UNK> on television and the stage br br to me his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with deborah kerr jason <UNK> jr robert <UNK> e g marshall anne jackson and <UNK> howard the film is set in pretty modern times the <UNK> <UNK> that was <UNK> in 1956 when briefly it looked like the iron curtain was about to collapse there under the <UNK> of hungarian <UNK> and his supporters but the hungarian revolution <UNK> due to bad timing the russians and their polish and east german allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt and arrested and executed and other <UNK> the west stood by and let this happen england and france had gotten caught in the crisis and the u s had <UNK> them and israel for attacking egypt due to the actions of three close allies of the u s the west found it hard to <UNK> the <UNK> of the soviet union it was an unfortunate situation and the <UNK> have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it br br in the film <UNK> is major a russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the hungarian revolt one of whom is paul jason <UNK> may be getting assistance from some <UNK> on a bus tour through <UNK> led by robert <UNK> including marshall jackson and howard and kerr the latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with them hoping for a lead to the <UNK> of <UNK> but <UNK> is human he tries to be <UNK> with these people all of whom see him as a monster and in sequence when he has drunk a little too much he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945 how is it even if one notes that russia had <UNK> in charge that relations between russia and the west <UNK> so quickly the allies on the whole had worked well together from 1941 to 1945 but after and all types of mutual <UNK> just <UNK> did they have to is a good officer but he is torn in half by loyalty to the communist <UNK> in the soviet union and in <UNK> that he supports and his growing <UNK> towards kerr who is hiding <UNK> but is also willing to note the more human side of the russian major and as the film reaches it's tragic climax we watch as has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty or take pity on kerr <UNK> and the other <UNK> who want to leave it becomes a true struggle for him and one that he may win far too late it was a great film about a tragedy of post war europe and possibly the most thoughtful role <UNK> <UNK> ever portrayed
<START> gone is the wonderful <UNK> of the original in place is a c grade action no <UNK> <UNK> is not all bad but <UNK> in comparison to the original all the meaningless sex and violence is gone and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot <UNK> see it but don't expect the thrills of the first
<START> during the summer the cue line for this attraction is really long since it is a water ride it's very well themed but a lot of the <UNK> seem to be out of order overall the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 <UNK> in line the drop at the end is exciting but the whole ride itself could have been better creators for indiana jones could have <UNK> helped these hollywood <UNK> also many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others it's also very when they only have one raft <UNK> <UNK> open and not the two like they are supposed to during halloween horror nights you ride in the dark and it's exciting if it's your first time but if it's not then don't bother waiting in a four hour line
<START> my top 2 actors happen to be in this film robert ryan and robert mitchum br br ryan could play anything from shakespeare to arthur miller and play it <UNK> in this film when he starts his speech people with names like and others with names that are hard to say it is chilling to watch him br br robert young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of sam <UNK> a <UNK> who is <UNK> with several soldiers in a bar mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it his <UNK> has been found in the apartment but mitchell is a gentle soldier who is only missing his wife br br the story is told from different perspectives mitchell and strike up a friendship and go back to apartment seems to know the loneliness that mitchell is feeling for years you have been <UNK> on one <UNK> and now it is gone you don't know what to feel he says about the war br br ryan is superb as monty the psychotic racist br br robert young along with dick powell was an actor whose career was re by film noir <UNK> they won't believe me and the other woman are great examples br br robert mitchum is his usual laid back self as the br br gloria graham and paul kelly as the odd couple are outstanding as well in their brief but telling roles br br this is probably the best film about racism ever made
<START> i honestly have to say that a cat in the brain is one of the most fun and unintentionally hilarious films i've ever seen this film is packed with stupid dialog ridiculous scenes and a self involving plot starring legendary horror director lucio fulci himself br br the <UNK> story line is about an aging director fulci who is also named lucio fulci in the film who is starting to go nuts and because of all the vicious things he's put down in film over the past many years he goes to a shrink who <UNK> fulci and tells him that he will believe himself to be a killer but that the shrink will actually be the one doing the killing the rest of the film is made up of shots from the film that fulci is directing during all this action scenes of the shrink killing people all the while <UNK> like a f <UNK> moron and some of <UNK> <UNK> sequences oh and a few tits thrown in for good measure as well br br a cat in the brain is completely over top and ridiculous in every sense the gore is classic fulci nasty and strong with some really decent scenes the chainsaw of a female corpse is pretty cool as is the chainsaw <UNK> of a small boy lots of <UNK> and other cool kill scenes make this one a pretty non stop bloodbath the ridiculous dialog <UNK> it <UNK> it as well as some of the insanely goofy scenes the nazi orgy the opera singing slap fest and the running down of an innocent <UNK> come easily to mind make this one fun as hell not nearly as dark as some of <UNK> other films cat is more of a self indulgent horror comedy that if it wasn't meant to be funny is actually kind of sad i say to grab a fifth of cheap <UNK> and settle in to this one i watched cat with a few friends and we laughed the entire time this is the feel good movie of the summer recommended 8 10
<START> is a moving and rewarding documentary in the world of wine there is a huge different between the big and the small one it's not just about size of of your <UNK> but also the amount of money and power you have if you have enough money to place ads in the wine <UNK> and hire a so called wine except then it doesn't matter the size of your estate also in business world of today wine often has to mass <UNK> and suited to people's taste what is means many times wine <UNK> of it's origin shows the commercial side of wine in that of mega producer robert and michael the wine expert who <UNK> wine to the taste of today's critics like robert parker who is also in the film now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine but they have power on a grand scale as we all know power <UNK> also shows small wine makers such as <UNK> of the and <UNK> de of <UNK> in <UNK> these wine makers are not starving wine makers but they know like all great wine makers that it's about where the <UNK> are from the best example of this is explained not by a wine maker but by a <UNK> man working for <UNK> the wine the area the <UNK> are grown the that matters that a <UNK> hand that knows this makes important real wine
<START> i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new wave br br who wasn't br br unfortunately what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of <UNK> new wave br br a <UNK> is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty br br just say no indeed in more ways than one including to watching this film br br i couldn't bear it after a while and began fast <UNK> through it it would have been <UNK> to have just <UNK> it altogether
<START> all my friends and various other <UNK> think this show is <UNK> great first i hate this show i think i might be the only female alive i only watched it because my best friend <UNK> it and <UNK> herself to be the charlotte character br br first the whole plot if you can call it that is about four women samantha kim <UNK> who most likely has every <UNK> available and brown and green <UNK> considering she is <UNK> sexual she'll try anything br br samantha is not like most 40 something women even in ny but than the show would not have some kind of entertainment since samantha along with some good ny scenery is the only reason to watch and those are not reason enough br br charlotte <UNK> davis is a well dressed upper class ny idiot who still believes the charming myth however sweet and pretty she is do not let that fool you she <UNK> quite often br br miranda <UNK> <UNK> now this woman is stereotypical angry butch feminist i think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian but apparently is not what a shame she's almost interesting br br carrie sarah jessica parker the most annoying character i swear i thought i was watching twisted sister front man dee more <UNK> looking cross dressing sissy boy brother this is a girl looking for can't live without you love heard of a puppy br br this show is stupid and i love making fun of it because i hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women that is just sad if your looking to watch <UNK> pathetic <UNK> people in way too expensive clothes drinking <UNK> and sounding like an annoying 15 <UNK> old on cocaine than there is a show for you just use protection
<START> this was a real let down for me the original bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy film but this one was pretty weak i didn't care at all for the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story wasn't well developed while the first film was tragic and involving this one was tedious as i merely counted the time to the end when the ill <UNK> lovers would actually meet the action was poor in this one as well the fights were not choreographed very well and there really wasn't much kung fu at all just a few weak sword fights between the highly <UNK> likable <UNK> and one of <UNK> lin herself mainly uses a sort of <UNK> to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair a far cry from the impressive showing with the whip and kung fu she displayed in the previous film i still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was fast pace and i did want to see what was going to happen at the end though i as most anyone who watched the first one predicted it would go down the way it did and after seeing it i found it anti climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone i really recommend the first one but as for the sequel only fans of the genre and those who really want to see lin as the bride one more time need apply
<START> i went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line i understand that changes between written works and movies must be made for many reasons br br the changing of the relationship between the scientists they were father daughter in the book the director of was eliminated thus causing the scene between the and the director to be changed to the and the head of the swiss guard in the office br br ron howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a <UNK> with a <UNK> accent but missed all the symbolism both and the <UNK> to the heavens in the helicopter with hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the <UNK> in what was described as a christ like image br br at some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job
<START> i'm afraid i only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless tv trash and a waste of talent <UNK> tyler plays a <UNK> beauty but her acting skills are not yet <UNK> developed to give the part any real kick as she slowly <UNK> a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters even john goodman delivers his <UNK> comic lines with an absence of <UNK> as if the witless humour needs to be <UNK> slowly in case anyone misses the joke the ending is supposed to be good but the <UNK> and main course left me with no <UNK> to find out
<START> i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation <UNK> it was misplaced firstly this is not horror it doesn't scare and unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for which is possible doesn't try to it's a trashy comedy and the fact i <UNK> once means i gave it a 2 not a 1 this film of <UNK> in a truly special way i can't claim to have ever seen a film which <UNK> its self more very very bad avoid
<START> my wife and i saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much we wanted to see it again it was so moving that i was calling it a tear <UNK> the mystery that <UNK> was sent to report on is really no mystery at all angles it seems that ever time he turned around something happened to him all good and i believe it scared george a bit considering that he did not realize what he had gotten into it just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around if only we all could treat each other the same the world would be a better place to date we have been searching the net for a copy of it now i finally have a connection to it as soon as i can find a copy to buy i am going to grab it
<START> i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole <UNK> mess into a <UNK> here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film br br all mexican women are super hot remember that little desert town in <UNK> yeah well this must be it's mexican sister city don't even bother with the <UNK> just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well br br half of mexico is controlled by insane satan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the other half as everyone here in the u s knows is run by drug dealers fortunately this doesn't much <UNK> with the sex trade and our ultra low <UNK> <UNK> down there br br mexican cops are useless don't go to them go to the nearest occult <UNK> and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your <UNK> friend she'll be way more help than the cops br br when you're being <UNK> tortured by the aforementioned <UNK> <UNK> don't go <UNK> the <UNK> or any part of the bible really you'll just mess up the <UNK>
<START> i'm a huge fan of legendary director <UNK> kazan his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses be it obsessive love in <UNK> in the grass poverty in a tree grows in brooklyn or racism in <UNK> <UNK> while looking for other movies made by kazan i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller the movie called focus stars william h macy who happens to be one of my favorite actors and laura dern it deals with anti <UNK> in a very realistic way br br <UNK> character seems to go along with the <UNK> in his neighborhood and on his job until it affects him personally that's the key here the reason he acted wasn't because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand he acted because he was now considered an <UNK> and he began to experience the same looks the same remarks and the same brutally that mr david experienced br br the movie is very well written and well acted meat <UNK> does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag both macy and <UNK> performances are outstanding it's easier in life to go along with instead of going against sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives or the lives of their loved ones only then will some find their moral <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie once a long time ago just once and i didn't know where it had come from and i looked for about six years to find it and i finally found it here at imdb com just the whole concept of the movie is great i believe it's got something to do with a race of beings keeping <UNK> on us and our planet but there is one person who keeps out of being <UNK> into <UNK> and the way that he does it to keep himself from being <UNK> and located is what keeps the movie entertaining i don't remember exactly how it ended but i remember it finished with a great climax and a good twist
<START> this is the first film i've watched from the italian ed wood <UNK> <UNK> aka miles <UNK> the above title was added later on since there exists another similarly titled <UNK> movie starring richard which was hammer <UNK> michael one and only stab at the western the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam but they called him it was actually <UNK> in the italian <UNK> which of course implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli br br while certainly not <UNK> bad instances of <UNK> and <UNK> abound so that i was often cracking up into <UNK> of laughter a horrid number by a would be irresistible french <UNK> a totally irrelevant bar room <UNK> actors doing <UNK> when being shot an aged <UNK> doing an <UNK> dance routine <UNK> use indeed abuse of slow motion and easily the most preposterous seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln <UNK> play two <UNK> sporting the actors' own names hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all br br lead actor robert woods is just that even down to <UNK> <UNK> the over the bodies of his victims supporting actress actually the director's own daughter as the <UNK> broad is quite a <UNK> but unfortunately she doesn't get to do much in the film  despite having a change of heart towards the end the main musical theme is actually pretty good but again the title song is in itself quite lousy
<START> although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books it is in my opinion a great movie it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart <UNK> as <UNK> he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book but to be fair he would not look good with blond hair and <UNK> is most definitely about looking good he moves like the predator i always imagined <UNK> would have br br the visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing it's not interview with the vampire so don't try to compare the two interview is <UNK> story this is a cut and <UNK> version of in any case i highly recommend
<START> this should have been a short film nothing more the length of 1 5 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke it's getting more and more on your nerves <UNK> you finally kick out your brain to endure that movie br br to do yourself a favor don't mention to see that movie
<START> seeing as how i am a big fan of both fall and if lucy fell i came to with high expectations i am not sure i could have been more disappointed this had it all weak dialogue weak performances you name it i was let down oh well better luck next time eric
<START> i think the title of the movie describes it well if you are looking for a documentary on louis <UNK> and his work you'll have to look somewhere else although some of that is covered in this film br br of course i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case so i believed what i was told about <UNK> and his father etc br br for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that <UNK> would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player br br this really is a journey through someone's life and i was happy to tag along for the experience a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well br br oh and the footage of some of <UNK> work is stunning
<START> i'm pleased that this was the work of foreign <UNK> because it can't be accused of unfair bias with absolutely no cause the cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to <UNK> of the murder of a white foreign tourist they picked a 15 <UNK> old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him in addition to the <UNK> resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of <UNK> <UNK> of a completely innocent young black teenager it makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged imprisoned and subsequently found innocent this <UNK> is well produced <UNK> recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you won't want to take a 1 minute break if you care about social justice don't miss this one it certainly deserved its oscar
<START> the story is about a psychic woman <UNK> who returns to her hometown and begins <UNK> her traumatic childhood past the death of her childhood friend and abusive father <UNK> discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders br br you really don't need to find out because oh my god this was so so so so bad i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of <UNK> then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching but do not be fooled the ending was predictable the acting terrible don't even get me started about the southern accents <UNK> and the story was trite just remember you were warned
<START> this move is absolutely most certainly one of the greatest films of its or any other genre kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten 2001 a space odyssey is a journey unlike anything i have ever seen on the screen kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development just with visuals along 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying 10 out of 10 no doubt for my money it doesn't get much better than 2001 a space <UNK> now the sequel <UNK> that's a different story
<START> shame on you if you give this film a low rating how can you not like a film that has doug <UNK> peter cushing silly rubber monsters fights and for the guys that woman that was the <UNK> in the spy who loved me and one of the seventies <UNK> films not wearing very much of whom my mother said she wasn't picked for the colour of her eyes <UNK> silly <UNK> and a <UNK> victorian <UNK> machine very much like the one used in the old thunderbirds series whoever watched this film and <UNK> it off was watching it for the wrong reasons it may be crap but is definitely good crap they don't make 'em like they used to sigh
<START> 80's sleazy <UNK> rock is like 90's house music or current it's boring and has no ideas or ideals the only thing that makes it a bit <UNK> nowadays is that it's a long time ago so we can laugh at its too bad <UNK> <UNK> has no laughs at all as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years br br chris mark <UNK> is singer of a steel dragon tribute band when he's kicked of the band at the same time the real steel dragon singer is kicked of as well he becomes the next lead singer you already know how this is gonna end up at that time with chris losing it with sex drugs and r r and forgetting about his long time girlfriend manager emily jennifer aniston br br there's way too much boring music in this standard formula packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost watch the over rated but still more fun almost famous instead or even better a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions that thing you do br br what a stinker 2 10
<START> a train holding union soldiers is <UNK> 300 000 of gold along with a <UNK> <UNK> who's there to see it reaches its destination but it's suddenly robbed by the <UNK> however <UNK> off with the gold and hides it but when tries to get it out of him he's killed by soldiers the only clue is that of a <UNK> but is captured and soon would be executed a stranger dressed up as a priest comes by who after the bounty of and offers to save his life for half of the gold in exchange gives him half of the <UNK> but <UNK> notices it and discovers something is up soon all three are crossing each other for the gold but also the <UNK> insurance company and gang are watching on waiting for their chance to <UNK> br br just watching the opening sequence you'll know you're in for a spaghetti western with a tongue in cheek style and a <UNK> of <UNK> many references some nicely realised from other films largely the dollar trilogy of its sub genre director <UNK> <UNK> direction is <UNK> and mostly lightweight but there's potential in many of his grand <UNK> set pieces and smooth <UNK> pace largely there's a lot of <UNK> fist fights and plenty of <UNK> stunts taking place compared with all out vicious <UNK> however most of these stunts are very well done and very enjoyable and when the guns are blazing there's energy to burn the traditional story sticks close to conventional details but since there's a lot of conniving and going on the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite certain how it's eventually going to play out between the three this leads up to many effective suspenseful moments clever twists and plenty of <UNK> <UNK> the humour within the script is pretty sly worked in <UNK> amongst the light and <UNK> style is <UNK> <UNK> taut framing and <UNK> de <UNK> rousing music score the performances are extremely well <UNK> and form a striking <UNK> george <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger gilbert <UNK> brings class and intelligence to his <UNK> mexican <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives a <UNK> performance as <UNK> that holds up well <UNK> o'hara doesn't get much to do but is a worthy <UNK> gerard <UNK> <UNK> and provide able support br br a fun and worthy spaghetti parody homage that throws one <UNK> ball after another and many <UNK> down <UNK> dirty antics
<START> it's all about getting what you want when you want it and the message of <UNK> wife is to be careful what you wish for until what you wish for wishes for you br br most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't <UNK> and a certain part of your <UNK> turning blue misogynistic pirates aside cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very <UNK> to getting what he wants whenever he wants it learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through a twisted in soul and in practice business deal he ends up <UNK> buying her with the intent of <UNK> her but she will have none of it literally and <UNK> him at every turn and corner and room and tourist attraction br br the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double <UNK> and <UNK> humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not <UNK> to and may not enjoy seeing in either cooper or <UNK> the whole reason i watched the film was because they are likable actors and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves they think from the world br br if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film and satisfaction as we said is what it's all about such a movie with such a cast only comes around after all once in a <UNK> blue moon
<START> here's another entertaining clint eastwood action suspense film i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him he knows how to make entertaining movies this is one more example it didn't hurt either to have john <UNK> as his co star now there is an intense actor in this story <UNK> plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch thanks to his different <UNK> and the terrific dialog he was given he also has a interesting voice br br <UNK> russo is fairly low key for her but that's fine and eastwood plays the usual loner cop role not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end i guess he couldn't stop playing the dirty harry type figures but he played them well br br there were some <UNK> this film however namely credibility in parts as there were a couple of times had this been real life the killer would have done away with eastwood the climatic scene in particularly had too many holes in it there also were too many <UNK> of <UNK> name in vain in here br br overall however this is good <UNK> fare
<START> this is probably one of the best french movies i had seen in a very long time this <UNK> or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end some references to today's world are very subtle the whole context of the movie is to be understood in light of today's french culture environment that said all the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are <UNK> and accepted because this is a parody br br i was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that i should go too and assured me that i was going to have a great time and indeed i had if you liked the old <UNK> movies with sean connery and also like movies like airplane or hot shots you will be delighted i just hope this movie is released on dvd in the us wait and see
<START> the original road house is by no means an award winning film but it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time it shouldn't have been that hard to make a sequel there's no need for a big budget big name stars and spectacular visual effects even the story didn't have to be original all it needed was a good time vibe and some great fist fights i don't mean matrix style wire fu just some well choreographed <UNK> <UNK> lots of them there are a couple of decent fights in the movie but none of them are memorable and the focus is more on gun play plus the way it ties in to the original film is laughable <UNK> on insulting <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> an undercover <UNK> agent who is good with his hands and feet but here's the <UNK> he's the son of patrick <UNK> character dalton say what let's see the original road house was made in 1989 so for dalton to have a son in his late <UNK> maybe even 30 in 2006 well you get the idea they give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle <UNK> will <UNK> while his father <UNK> around a lot oh please that itself almost <UNK> <UNK> this movie off but i <UNK> <UNK> is completely out of his element sure he can throw a couple of kicks but he's got nothing going on as an actor plus he's referred to in the movie by the bad guys as pretty boy i've never <UNK> men that closely but i don't think this guy is too good looking he looks sick his face is way too thin and his <UNK> eyes make it look like he's going to pass out at any moment i'd never heard of him before but i think he should give up acting and go back to his day job jake busey plays the local drug runner wild bill busey is not a terrible actor he was good in starship troopers and even made a menacing villain in <UNK> 2 but here he just <UNK> the scenery in standard bad guy mode even his dialog is yawn worthy we're supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket but why what does he do because he wants to buy a bar from <UNK> by any means necessary ellen has the token girlfriend role a woman with a secret too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 2 2 she's the local <UNK> school teacher who happens to be a former army soldier guess what that means it means that while she may <UNK> with fear for the majority of the movie she'll be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly oh well at least she's hot actually the fight between her and wild <UNK> girl is the best one in the movie it's fast brutal and entertaining which leads me to my next problem with the movie the fights as i said <UNK> knows how to throw a punch the same can't be said for anyone he faces in the movie obviously the movie will all come down to <UNK> versus busey busey is an actor not a fighter he doesn't possess the skills to pull of a movie fight <UNK> may have been a trained dancer but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights he also faced a couple of worthy opponents and had one killer literally move none of that here with a couple of exceptions the fights are forced poorly staged and routine the punches sound like someone <UNK> a <UNK> on the <UNK> and there's even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match up to the punch it's embarrassing there isn't even the good southern redneck music of the original road house had the jeff <UNK> band who were a somewhat popular band at the time this movie features a singer called john otto whose music is tepid and his acting even worse he's given one line in the movie which was probably inserted to <UNK> whatever fans he may have out there either that or someone <UNK> him a favor my final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being <UNK> the continuity movies are shot out of sequence and then it's the <UNK> job to piece it all together well someone should give the editor of this movie a little <UNK> the problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes to re used footage at the end of the movie in the beginning we are introduced to the bar the black as the camera moves through the bar you see the band the <UNK> and the people dancing at the end of the movie when the bad guys have been defeated we get another shot of the same bar with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl the problem is the footage of the people in the bar is the same footage from the beginning of the movie i kid you not it's the same people standing or dancing in the same places wearing the same clothes want to know the funniest part you see <UNK> in the shot that were killed earlier in the movie do yourself a favor don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out and punch someone this movie will make you angry enough to do it
<START> like a terrible cancer <UNK> out of the sky i <UNK> into this <UNK> on some movie channel the other night being a fan of bad movies and <UNK> engaging in the <UNK> and viewing of said bad film i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times after that wore off though i found my hands inexplicably turning against me grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck something sinister was in that tape <UNK> where was i anyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film i've run across william forsythe can't play more than one character and that character is always a walking joke even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny ala <UNK> he's laughable in the wrong way erika <UNK> is much the same having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them she doesn't fail to help <UNK> up this one classic b movie villain guy andrew <UNK> does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on even reliable <UNK> for b movie action daniel <UNK> fails to deliver anything <UNK> on entertainment as for the film's own merits the plot is lame the script just like the action and the plot movement is both dull and well stupid for lack of a better <UNK> lord knows they didn't put any effort into it why should i br br anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie <UNK> and simply feel so inclined as to test your <UNK> before you do though take it from me this one isn't even terrible enough to be enjoyed unlike say some of the more ludicrous italian zombie films a fan of b movie action would be much better off checking out most any of other films or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter america simply is not the place to go to for action it seems especially not now if you have a <UNK> check out anything from over the <UNK> films like heroic duo or the slightly less normal along with anything else in the awesome <UNK> <UNK> cannon will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere especially here
<START> i knew next to nothing about this movie until i <UNK> to rent it it was a very pleasant surprise the cast is excellent including matthau whom i do not normally care for he makes a credible romantic lead hawn is a sweet <UNK> and bergman is touching as a woman coming out of her shell
<START> it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches some manage to do so with great talent <UNK> doesn't on the paper the movie looked interesting though the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy dark humour and a very style director unfortunately kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm every joke is <UNK> as no one <UNK> in the theater the movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a <UNK> of boredom
<START> my wife and kids was and still is the best comedy series on tv ever made i really enjoyed it and everyone in the u k still watch the the wayans bros should all somehow be featuring together in a comedy show my wife and kids was a comedy the whole family could watch and you don't get that very often isn't there anything we can do to make it happen again we would do anything to have that comedy show on again 1 damon wayans should make a come back i would really like damon wayans to star or make another comedy like this one of course with the help of the whole wayans family i was really sad when it ended that way and i hope they will be more to come in the future brilliant comedy excellent stuff yours truly
<START> carlos <UNK> just plain isn't funny his show is painful to watch because of that his sketches parodies are all very horrible and this really just feels like a filler for the <UNK> show which while i'm not a big fan of that it is much funnier than this trash carlos <UNK> gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going der der der it's just not funny he often when talking to others makes <UNK> they are horrible and painful when people don't laugh he blames them why would anyone laugh he's not funny he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this one of my least favorite things he does is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's <UNK> down a station that doesn't need to be <UNK> down anymore
<START> i saw this on dvd with subtitles which made it a little frustrating to get through because of the film's length but i was <UNK> throughout all of it that i was fascinated by the characters and always <UNK> in the story despite the subtitles is a testament to the film's power it's an amazing piece of work i have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time it's easily the best foreign film i've seen in the last twenty years or so i would like to know the full story behind the making of this film it must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations its use of some hardcore scenes on the tv in the motel room may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it but if you don't mind those you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one
<START> <UNK> massacre 2003 br br starring <UNK> charity <UNK> byron leonard johnson e eddie <UNK> samantha phillips <UNK> april flowers <UNK> fritz <UNK> tyler brad <UNK> summer williams <UNK> stevens melissa br br plot a group of <UNK> along with their coach and three guys are on their way to a game when suddenly their van breaks down and they take <UNK> in a nearby cabin soon they drink have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an unseen killer br br the good a few laughs surprising identity of the killer a <UNK> stevens cameo my favorite scene from the <UNK> party massacre used as a flashback br br the bad i was excited about this film i loved all three <UNK> party <UNK> because they were just so fun and i was expecting a lot from this <UNK> party <UNK> house massacre with scream tones but it just sucked they <UNK> it on the we're cheesy but proud thing and basically made soft core porn but with a good who <UNK> it br br
<START> i loved this film which i have just seen at the philadelphia film festival in march 2005 i went to india with 2 friends and this movie was very real i related to everything and <UNK> every moment the characters are believable the story poignant and the ending realistic but not sentimental i also enjoyed the discussion with the director after the showing this movie shows very well the <UNK> but not complete mixing of 2 worlds east and west the supporting cast was wonderful depicting the life a tourist encounters in india quite realistically the humor is subtle and at times dry and this makes it all the more realistic as it is woven into the daily <UNK> of the characters it is so easy to identify with each of the situations portrayed
<START> pretty dreadful movie about several <UNK> young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance but i would recommend this film only to die hard fans of the actress
<START> one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is <UNK> halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle man <UNK> a physically non <UNK> middle aged man originally from in southern italy when we're introduced to him at the start of the film he's been living a non life in an elegant but <UNK> hotel in the italian speaking <UNK> of switzerland for the last ten years <UNK> a business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently <UNK> scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count <UNK> cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual <UNK> full of tightly <UNK> at the news he quietly but threatens his <UNK> bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the <UNK> that when you <UNK> you have to <UNK> right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you can't <UNK> for a while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of <UNK> troubles br br this initially unsympathetic character a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> man on the verge of 50 a man who won't even <UNK> in kind to and <UNK> who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the <UNK> cares deeply about at one point in his non life decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal <UNK> days and nights in that hotel at an oddly deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of <UNK> the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with <UNK> edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out br br never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat <UNK> more at odds than since the release of films such as le or another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the <UNK> insomnia not unlike the <UNK> and in a far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le uses this condition to <UNK> a deeper emotional <UNK> that's been <UNK> so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it's almost impossible to pin point its cause if indeed there is one br br the young and sympathetic hotel waitress <UNK> played by olivia <UNK> grand daughter of the legendary anna and the memory of best friend a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that eventually though <UNK> at first accepts to look through again though it's never <UNK> <UNK> out the <UNK> knows that to a man like accepting the consequences of love will have <UNK> consequences a film without a single scene of sex or violence a film that unfolds in its own time and <UNK> nothing to the expectations le is a fine representative of that small quiet <UNK> renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more <UNK> <UNK> like fare more la <UNK> <UNK> style films <UNK> to explore fine creations like le and others your loss world
<START> <UNK> is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without <UNK> to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way br br highest praise goes david <UNK> and sarah <UNK> for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in <UNK> bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes in addition harry performance as the son just on the <UNK> of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house br br at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good <UNK> to wake up to reality stop <UNK> and start <UNK> to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it's the show's greatest strength truth without sugar <UNK> to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances br br this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s
<START> whenever <UNK> <UNK> appeared or directed a film in the 30's 40's and 50's you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white <UNK> was able to capture audiences and keep them <UNK> until the very end of her pictures in this film as mrs helen gordon high <UNK> <UNK> along with robert ryan howard <UNK> golden <UNK> <UNK> she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor mrs gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection if you liked <UNK> <UNK> who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated this is the film for you to enjoy i truly believe that <UNK> <UNK> was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the movie industry
<START> some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the classics but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of <UNK> faced wanna be critics completely <UNK> it off this film made me laugh <UNK> several times this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them everyone has friends like both of these guys another highlight for me was the monster truck it's awesome <UNK> and really well shot taking inspiration completely stealing from loads of films the most obvious being duel <UNK> <UNK> and probably in reference to the jack black alike co star orange county but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here but so what it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of <UNK> and laughs and on that score it's a 10 obviously it's not getting a 10 i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99 of the people on imdb there is no way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares you really can't get anymore simple than that
<START> a touching story told with <UNK> awkward young jewish girl in wwii america befriends an escaped german <UNK> who is hiding out in her <UNK> they discuss their lives and beliefs he's anti hitler she <UNK> him food he becomes her only friend and ally all this reminded me of the much better theatrical film <UNK> down the wind where <UNK> mills befriends convict alan bates but you certainly can't fault the direction here which is smooth or the performances which are sterling mature in her pre teen years <UNK> carries most of the picture and never hits a false note suddenly when the prisoner is discovered and <UNK> is found out as well the movie gets very tough her father shocked and ashamed that his child would <UNK> with that nazi lays into her with a quiet fury i have seldom seen before he tells her you are dead to me which must be devastating for a little girl to hear the final scenes don't cop out there are no big <UNK> no hand holding <UNK> the girl has to face the world and in doing so learns a bitter lesson about neighbors friends and family a startling film
<START> i waited quite awhile till i was able to watch this lone ranger movie i finally got to see it on the lone star channel today and was very disappointed in the whole movie <UNK> moore and john hart acted better lone rangers and jay as <UNK> than the two stars in this movie very poor acting was done by everyone in this movie even the plot was bad and far <UNK> i believe the horse portraying silver was the best actor throughout this movie i am glad i didn't go out and buy a copy of this movie when it first came out as i feel it's a waste of good money i am truly sorry the characters that <UNK> moore john hart and jay played and brought to life on the silver screen have been <UNK> so badly unless in the future they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same manner which <UNK> john and jay did so well in the past i'll not spend the money to buy the movie i'll not watch this movie again br br wayne davies
<START> now i'm a big animation fan love and usually am into all <UNK> of stop motion so i had high hopes for this one then i came on imdb and <UNK> i'm always real suspicious of films with a distribution of votes on imdb here we've got another a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> anyone and then some real low ones i'm also suspicious of <UNK> with the word <UNK> in them br br sure there are <UNK> but this character isn't one of them despite my <UNK> i saw this film and have to side with the ones the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish treat yourself to the real deal get some and leave this also ran on the shelf
<START> i rented this film courtesy of netflix thinking i would receive the 1972 version i sat clueless watching this new version thinking gee the production values were spectacular i was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly <UNK> sound to it i was even more convinced that this was a 70s film when it occurred to me almost every five seconds that the one thing that was missing between gene and finney was an intense hug a loaded stare a passionate kiss br br i'm sorry although john <UNK> himself has <UNK> that this was not a homosexual relationship it is painfully obvious that yes that's exactly what it was when people usually <UNK> of the same sex have intense friendships it means that those <UNK> for love <UNK> the desire to express <UNK> sexually are all <UNK> over these boys needed to connect but they were never allowed to br br also despite a spirited performance by toby moore i never felt any of the emotions were real i never connected to either of the boys for the very reason their relationship was not truly honest br br people want to live in a fantasy and think that because this took place in the 1940s that these boys couldn't have had these sexual feelings for each other but i say they did at least in the book they did and in this movie finney had them almost painfully for gene the intensity that john <UNK> suggests existed between them was a closet homosexuality a hero worship an <UNK> that would under normal circumstances be expressed in a sexual way even if these boys were <UNK> it it should have been crystal clear but this movie doesn't even really hint at it br br lastly there is an unbelievably bizarre moment when finney who has broken his leg is <UNK> jumped on by all the other boys during a ball game unless they were just a bunch of <UNK> they would know they could not possibly throw their bodies against him obviously this bone shattering moment was lost on both the director and the producer
<START> an eye opening documentary about the 1993 siege of a religious <UNK> compound near <UNK> texas <UNK> six people including <UNK> leader david <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> that destroyed the compound there is still <UNK> debate over how the fire started homicide or suicide can you still trust government <UNK> br br
<START> the movie uses <UNK> that could be <UNK> from wait until dark 1967 a much better movie by <UNK> young starring audrey hepburn dead silent is a pale <UNK> there is nothing new here the hidden object in the doll the bad men wanting it the bad guy posing as a good guy the <UNK> though has <UNK> audrey hepburn couldn't see the child in <UNK> cannot speak but both stories <UNK> on the <UNK> where wait until dark built up unbearable suspense dead silent lets you guess the outcome the story being such a stereotype
<START> i thought this movie was great i saw this when it came out in the theaters so i do not remember all the details i remember it being based on <UNK> tale on <UNK> names places and events are changed but you can still see the resemblance to the tale br br i found it funny how they would get themselves into trouble and how they would get themselves out of it i really enjoyed this version of <UNK> old tales much better than the romeo and juliet with <UNK> danes br br i will agree that in some parts of the tale it does get a little to silly at times but all in all it is a great adventure with some big name actors
<START> this only gets <UNK> because it stars david <UNK> well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn't too bad it has the beautiful leslie <UNK> she is super hot but can't talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is <UNK> raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as <UNK> 3 10
<START> this film is wonderful film for students of film in mainstream american film it is common to see <UNK> techniques used to draw the audience into the movie in this film the director uses <UNK> techniques to push the story forward br br this is a love story that offers no sex to be honest i can't even recall the characters kissing rather the plot focuses on the emotional ties between the two characters br br i would not recommend this film for everybody it is not very accessible it is very slow moving and the subtle it is a difficult film and mostly not entertaining br br i would this film to people who want to see something different it is a piece of art the soundtrack is most beautiful and visually every frame is a photograph and most beautiful of all it's not visually stimulating for the sake of being visually stimulating every frame illustrates a little bit more of the story
<START> the movie started very well so far <UNK> <UNK> could be believed but later gosh i didn't know if it was a horror movie a drama one or a must not see one the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie the make up well it looked pretty real at beginning but at the end last part of movie the make up especially teeth and eyes was very exaggerated if you want a good <UNK> movie watch the <UNK> of emily rose br br together with hard candy totally boring pathetic plot and ending these two movies are the worst i've seen from <UNK> but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films but with this one you will wish you never rent it <UNK> movie fans just stay with two the exorcist and emily <UNK> <UNK>
<START> well on the day that rob schneider <UNK> himself further into the black hole of <UNK> bad movies by starring in the absolutely not at all wanted <UNK> <UNK> european <UNK> <UNK> wasn't there a film called <UNK> which was followed by a sequel called and now there's <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> followed by sequel <UNK> <UNK> european <UNK> i smell a pattern perhaps soon there will be <UNK> european <UNK> are <UNK> or not i am writing about this much <UNK> at time of release film i was one of those i must admit i turned my nose up at it even while chris <UNK> shoved cocaine up his nose and the snl cast <UNK> through one of the worst seasons in their history in <UNK> <UNK> the norm <UNK> notwithstanding films like happy <UNK> tommy boy and black sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of spade <UNK> schneider sandler films however i watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after chris died and could not stop laughing yes it's not particularly sophisticated <UNK> does what <UNK> does not unlike <UNK> being <UNK> but his van down by the river <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in which he <UNK> that while he may not wash enough or wear well fitting clothes or use <UNK> more than twice a week <UNK> well here as the ever self <UNK> character who realizes he's not the <UNK> not the best looking and could stand to lose a few pounds all the same he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to and david spade just <UNK> off his <UNK> one liners as he did for <UNK> hollywood minute and basically <UNK> self <UNK> there's really not a whole lot more to say than that i love the one scene when <UNK> catches spade <UNK> his monkey and then makes a couple <UNK> about it can't remember what the first one is but the second one they're lying in their hotel <UNK> and <UNK> says to spade do you like baseball spade <UNK> something <UNK> in response and says the new york <UNK> <UNK> anyway <UNK> does his awkward painfully sensitive frat boy <UNK> if you like you like it i couldn't stop laughing

<START> i will admit i didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film but to be honest i don't think it would have <UNK> basically local sidney <UNK> sid james <UNK> the incompetent mayor <UNK> <UNK> kenneth connor of to hold a beauty contest to improve the town's image they face opposition from women's <UNK> june <UNK> trying to <UNK> the contest but they do have publicity agent peter potter bernard <UNK> and palace hotel owner connie joan <UNK> soon enough the young beautiful wannabe models show up including hope springs barbara <UNK> paula <UNK> valerie leon dawn <UNK> margaret nolan debra sally <UNK> and <UNK> downs <UNK> wendy richard when the girls have cat fights it does draw away regular residents but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny <UNK> and william jack douglas having over active <UNK> it does finally reach the competition and it's just afterwards i couldn't be bothered also starring <UNK> rowlands as mildred <UNK> peter <UNK> as <UNK> joan as mrs dukes david <UNK> as police inspector angela grant as miss arnold <UNK> as <UNK> robin as larry patricia franklin as <UNK> jimmy logan as cecil and <UNK> <UNK> bill pertwee as fire <UNK> chief charles <UNK> had obviously quit the carry <UNK> but where's kenneth williams i suppose seeing <UNK> and young beautiful looking pauline <UNK> in <UNK> but for comedy value this fails miserably and the <UNK> of the <UNK> just gets on your nerves pretty poor

<START> i love the so called <UNK> films and have seen dozens some such as <UNK> comes to harlem <UNK> and hammer have excellent production values and are very entertaining while many others are very cheap and silly but still entertaining such as <UNK> of death or <UNK> however <UNK> manages something rare for the genre it's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining it's like <UNK> made for very very stupid people br br years ago i saw a <UNK> on the <UNK> films on mad tv and unfortunately the real <UNK> isn't any better like the parody the acting is just atrocious <UNK> ray moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of <UNK> wood he can barely read his lines and his karate is a joke with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again as for the rest of the actors many might be even worse my favorite was the fbi guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really <UNK> to get them out yet they didn't even bother to re film these scenes in fact so much of it was inept that i had a hard time <UNK> out whether the film was intended as a joke br br if you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film you're wrong even for the <UNK> out there hoping to see some skin will be disappointed the naked women in the film really do look like hard luck prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their <UNK> bodies i think looking at old people naked <UNK> old people naked is no worse than looking at these ladies and as for <UNK> ray he has man boobs no black super hero or anti hero should look that bad naked for goodness <UNK> put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by <UNK> br br <UNK> apparently there are actually sequels to this film i can't imagine watching them so you'll just have to find someone else to review them i have watched plan 9 from outer space teenagers from outer space and robot monster but i just don't think i can bring myself to see another <UNK> film they are that bad
<START> the disney <UNK> remake of their own 1965 slapstick classic concerns a clever <UNK> leading an f b i agent to a kidnapped woman christina <UNK> gives a <UNK> let me outta here performance as the <UNK> owner and the fed is played by doug e doug embarrassingly over the top like a human cartoon a pair of rich <UNK> <UNK> cannon and original cat cast member dean jones are funny and the formula plot still has a little juice left in it but the handling here is so heavy and <UNK> and the cat is so lifeless that it's strictly d o a br br from
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty <UNK> br br the acting is pathetic i know acting is hard work and stuff but that's why it should be left to real actors watching these people act is like watching michael j fox perform brain surgery it's shaky at best br br one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of dan gordon as chris only dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting br br the special effects in this movie were terrible the worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the <UNK> it looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a <UNK> box sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top but it didn't help i suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single computer from the late 80s
<START> i realize why people hate this film and i hated blair witch project so go figure this is about as staged as it gets yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real i really liked the <UNK> storyline though it's more than likely made up but the main reason i like this film is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking kidnapping them i get chill <UNK> every time have to look behind me as it feels like <UNK> there with me i know it's my imagination but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas dvd's doesn't give me <UNK> so that makes this a creepy delight not for everyone as <UNK> will hate it not for <UNK> as with a pg 13 rating there is no gore and the females are very annoying you'll wish the ghosts would take them off experiment on them before it's all said done out of
<START> a few years ago while i was renting some movies i came across <UNK> 4 ended up watching it and actually kind of liking it we need a good vampire gore flick that doesn't hold back but when i went back to the video store they said they didn't have any other <UNK> videos unfortunately the same went for any other video store i checked out i gave up until someone on youtube actually posted all the <UNK> films and i got to watch them all last night and i'm hooked i am now a fan of the full moon <UNK> series i think because this was the type of horror film i have been looking for i've been looking for a good cheesy scare for a long time and <UNK> filled that spot is one of the coolest vampires on screen and almost gives <UNK> a run for his <UNK> br br is an evil vampire who is after his blood stone his birth <UNK> the stone contains some blood that is absolutely incredible and gives him strength three american girls who are studying romanian history and culture <UNK> into a man <UNK> who offers to help they stay at castle where we find out that <UNK> is brother <UNK> and turns two of the girls but <UNK> falls for one of the girls michelle and will do anything to protect her br br <UNK> is a fun series despite the cheesy effects it makes it in some ways more likable plus was a perfect villain as <UNK> was the perfect angel like romantic vampire the story is chilling and i think this was a fun vampire movie this was also the first in the series the best part is the sequels are just as fun i would recommend this for a scary movie night watch it in the dark is sure to send <UNK> down your spine or even your neck ok cheesy joke couldn't resist br br 7 10
<START> i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best the only funny character is believe it or not andy dick the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes gags and the writing was bad i mean i know its supposed to be like <UNK> but it just did work besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already with all the austin powers movies undercover brother it just seems old it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother which also wasn't hysterical but a lot funnier than this also for an comedy action movie the direction was kind of bland i don't know if this is going to be released in theaters but it <UNK> is made for tv
<START> although it might seem a bit bizarre to see a <UNK> year old woman play the part of a 12 year old mary pickford soon makes you forget the <UNK> and simply enjoy the fun br br mary is a street kid in new york city with her own lovable gang of <UNK> makers whose <UNK> are engaged by the older william haines he was 25 at the time just on the <UNK> of his own screen stardom br br to give away too much of the plot would not be fair suffice it that mary is great fun to watch <UNK> displays why she was hollywood's first and most beloved super star production values are very good with lots of extras making the nyc street scenes quite believable
<START> <UNK> is back but this time he is not scary a lot but he is funny br br when <UNK> is brought back to life in the doll of course by his old trailer trash girlfriend <UNK> he promptly kills her and transforms her into a doll too <UNK> and <UNK> are now on the case of 2 high school <UNK> br br don't miss this film it is a whole lot of fun it is scary funny weird wacky and stupid all in one br br my rating 9 10
<START> in all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode by this i mean that had you not followed the tv series homicide life on the street i suspect that you would have a hard time following this made for tv movie having said that homicide the movie is still a great watch i think it says a lot about a television production that every single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program the movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well it's all very bitter sweet knowing that this will be the last time we will see them all together again under the title of homicide story wise i found this film somewhat lacking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> seems particularly contrived and i felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the <UNK> of his regular position as <UNK> also <UNK> <UNK> extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but i for one never felt that it needed to be i enjoyed being left with a mystery let us recall that the very first <UNK> first case also went <UNK> for the entire series run as a devoted fan of the tv series i can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after h lots had been canceled but i would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series now if they'd just release it on dvd
<START> <UNK> wayans was so funny in low down dirty shame that i had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and steven seagal didn't help much it starts off with some odd religious killings that don't make much sense to jim campbell <UNK> he is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but jack cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well it's the same thing as all of his other movies smoke past cia involvement and now trying to be a normal cop why does steven dress up like he is from a western movie and the <UNK> on top of that make things a little confusing
<START> <UNK> starts in outer space where the <UNK> <UNK> tracks <UNK> <UNK> it's equipment <UNK> a 150 mile long alien spaceship in the head of the <UNK> unable to contact earth because of <UNK> colonel tom steve <UNK> decides this is the one only chance to investigate it going outside in some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship find the remains of a bat like race of creatures three perfect looking <UNK> two men chris jagger bill a beautiful woman <UNK> may all of whom they take aboard the <UNK> thirty days later back on earth the <UNK> is <UNK> on radar a rescue mission is sent up only to discover the spaceship is burnt out all the crew supposedly dead the rescue team do find the three <UNK> aliens though take them back to earth where in a space research center in london they come back to life start to literally suck the <UNK> out of human victims who then in turn need to do the same to stop themselves turning into dust things look grim as the <UNK> <UNK> throughout london br br this english production was produced by the notorious <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who during the early 80's were responsible for lots of cheap low budget action flicks under their production company cannon usually starring chuck norris they wanted to move into the big time signed director tobe hooper up on a three film deal which were this <UNK> the <UNK> from mars 1986 remake the texas chainsaw massacre 2 1986 a sequel to <UNK> own classic all of which <UNK> basically <UNK> both <UNK> <UNK> cannon was no more anyway despite being a commercial flop at the box office i have to say i think <UNK> is a highly enjoyable if rather silly sci fi horror when originally released into theatres back in <UNK> was cut down to 101 minutes by <UNK> <UNK> but over the past few years the longer <UNK> minute cut has all but replaced it on dvd vhs <UNK> tv although apparently <UNK> original cut of the film ran for <UNK> minutes so there's even more footage out there somewhere i will be <UNK> my comments on the longer <UNK> minute cut the script by dan don uncredited <UNK> by michael armstrong <UNK> was based on the 1976 novel 'the space <UNK> by colin wilson has many extraordinary ideas it's scope is truly ambitious one felt that it ends up being a bit of a mess but a hell of an entertaining one it moves along like a rocket at heart there's a really interesting story here although the film gets itself into a <UNK> there are also some hilarious moments in <UNK> the scene when the security guard tries to convince the naked female vampire to surrender by offering her a half eaten <UNK> is a true camp classic the horribly overwrought <UNK> scenes including the one where <UNK> ends up kissing patrick stewart many many more besides i don't know call me weird but i just thought <UNK> was tremendous fun highly entertaining in just about every way from silly character's odd dialogue strange ideas that never quite come together some terrific visuals <UNK> certainly isn't a film that will bore you br br director hooper had just about more money here to play around with than he ever has double what he had for <UNK> 1982 even he uses every bit of it to bring this spectacular film to the big screen john the guy responsible for star wars 1977 star trek the motion picture 1979 more recently spider man 2002 was brought in to handle the visual effects generally speaking they look fabulous the sequences set in outer space with <UNK> in particular look great there's also some really good visual effects back on earth including the destruction of london as of blue souls fly around everywhere there's some nudity but not much gore there are some <UNK> corpses a few <UNK> wounds the skin on <UNK> hand <UNK> off blood <UNK> from <UNK> eyes nose ears there's a severed arm as well as some zombies the special make up effects are also generally very good i wouldn't say <UNK> is scary as such as it's more of a sci fi film than horror i loved the way hooper shoots the outer space sequences as he keeps <UNK> his camera to effectively capture the feeling of that there is no floor as it were br br with a supposed budget of about 25 000 000 it made less than half that in it's theatrical run hasn't set the world <UNK> on video or dvd either which is a shame because although it's a bit of a mess it's very enjoyable to watch shot on location in england well filmed in 2 35 1 widescreen the 4 3 <UNK> image is horrible cuts huge <UNK> of information from both sides of the screen this is most noticeable during the opening scenes set in outer space where sometimes it's hard to make out what's going on the sense of the <UNK> of space the alien spaceship is lost the acting is ok in a very silly film patrick stewart replaced sir john gielgud nancy paul replaced olivia <UNK> frank <UNK> replaced <UNK> kinski while anthony hopkins turned the role of caine down br br <UNK> is a bizarre film no two ways about it really anyone looking for something simple straight forward should look elsewhere anyone looking for something a bit different in the sci fi genre than give <UNK> a go as it's one of those so bad it's good films with some impressive effects it isn't your average run of the mill film by any means
<START> is a visually stunning film and i don't think anyone is going to be able to argue that but unfortunately the story somewhat falls flat br br the film nevertheless is very entertaining it uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non <UNK> story the film almost works just based on it's characters and style but in my opinion leaves something to be desired
<START> well how and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline and try to <UNK> the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something <UNK> this film is all package and absolutely no substance br br it starts with promise young men dreaming of becoming <UNK> and engaging in the kind of excessive hero worship everyone can laugh at after that it all goes downhill <UNK> than a with no <UNK> the scene involving the first gig with steel dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of i have seen in a long time the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs will he get up and sing or will he stay there on the floor and not sing who cares by now it gets worse but i don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail if you watch it after this review its your own fault
<START> national <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is easily the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen the movie <UNK> anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid br br its hard to name everything wrong with this movie first off the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple <UNK> very well at all the acting is awful to say the least and the whole thing was poorly made any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again br br it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two because it is so bad but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie if you want a good movie to watch go turn on anything else on television even u s a has better movies than this br br friend
<START> in the changing world of cg and what not of cartoon animations etc etc was a warm welcome at least by me i think it's important to show these sort of films once in a while to <UNK> them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from people were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days call me old fashioned but i liked it it's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination
<START> hi i'm <UNK> an african yet white jungle <UNK> princess who possesses the incredible ability to <UNK> into the <UNK> monster in the world think 60s star trek aliens by rolling <UNK> in mud when i first found myself in this horrible position i took the only logical action i made myself a torn apart jungle bikini in which to perform my badly acted antics i enjoy romance novels and <UNK> apart the occasional unimpressive african <UNK> and i would be <UNK> if i did not mention my white of course sidekick mr cutter an american ex military man who seems to have <UNK> the u s after his divorce can you say <UNK> <UNK> anyway he provides the occasional distraction from my difficult life i mean how many idiot <UNK> do you know who are also an <UNK> species of flesh <UNK> monster despite my many <UNK> acting is so hard <UNK> i haven't given up and after much soul searching i have finally discovered my role in life to <UNK> late night television viewers who are so unfortunate as to not have cable or satellite
<START> the simpsons of course started off with christmas special <UNK> <UNK> on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode <UNK> on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the character's exactly as they became 20 years later so watch this episode in a pack of season 1 and enjoy early <UNK> doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode 73
<START> not even original in the plot ho hum there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting but the film follows the path of 90 of hollywood movies i don't really get samuel jackson's acting most of the time in his other films but he was rather good in this film he rarely <UNK> and went much further in his character rather than <UNK> to an in your face anger i liked eva <UNK> as usual and even though she is great eye candy she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress luis <UNK> was actually really good also except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film how can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into <UNK> land within a split second is there no original thought left in hollywood
<START> written by directed by and starring the <UNK> of camp bruce campbell easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a <UNK> affair filmed <UNK> in <UNK> all i can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny campbell plays an <UNK> american business man with a cheating wife <UNK> byron and trying to close a business <UNK> before he is murdered he hires a <UNK> to drive him around a strange little town not knowing that his wife is <UNK> with the taxi driver within moments of campbell being <UNK> the <UNK> is killed in the same location a mad scientist <UNK> <UNK> proceeds with an experiment putting the <UNK> brain inside the <UNK> head with massive <UNK> on his <UNK> campbell breaks free and <UNK> the streets looking for his wife all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over sized head campbell <UNK> his <UNK> face making silly expressions as he <UNK> with himself thus bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased i get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy <UNK> out the cast are ted <UNK> <UNK> and watch for this on the sci fi channel
<START> after a good start it turned out to be the worst piece of <UNK> than <UNK> propaganda i've ever seen this movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the holy bible br br to resume the ok let's call it a plot basically alien don't <UNK> people that we already know no in fact its demonic forces <UNK> people which are in new age stuff or witchcraft or read porno magazine as one protagonist does br br it's complete with the little emotional piano music when the lead character realize he must <UNK> follow christ to be saved br br a quote sums it all imagine a subtle piano music in the background you can't let others even those you love stop you from following the lord br br and we are supposed to live in an <UNK> age still work to do <UNK> this piece of crap
<START> if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of che guevara the cuban revolutionary who helped aid <UNK> castro in his <UNK> for power you'd better read up on cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine you are on the internet after all br br but whatever you do do not watch che br br unless of course you just want a good laugh br br all the reviewers of the time and <UNK> gave che their vote for worst film of the decade and no wonder have you seen this travesty its facts are <UNK> at best <UNK> is even unconvincing as a corpse and as for <UNK> <UNK> imitation br br like i said if you want a good laugh br br it's like watching a co production between the learning channel and mad magazine br br one star br br i wonder if palance can do w c fields too
<START> this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the <UNK> story by showing the police officer watching an episode of <UNK> this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all <UNK> minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
<START> this is just what we need a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university man or woman people others and <UNK> themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that br br so four men sit in <UNK> and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them and in the end one of the two wins great just f n great i'm also supposed to accept these four <UNK> <UNK> as being judges of people's game the term game has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term <UNK> <UNK> added to the fact that these men are called the experts just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture these are not god damn role models they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass if you enjoy the <UNK> <UNK> out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and spears have talent its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so br br and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid or that i'm just jealous go screw yourself because its obvious that a real girl certainly won't
<START> ok yes i know i'm a <UNK> and i have no knowledge of nor love for opera i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did but i don't so for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty sometimes <UNK> girls for what it's worth i thought the first segment with <UNK> russell who i didn't recognize was the best of the lot
<START> everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary the determination of everybody portrayed in this project was very moving to me and should connect to those of us who have ever <UNK> into any part of show business be it film music or writing i think the film makers could have done a better job with <UNK> the events that led up to this film becoming a documentary perhaps by use of a narrator other than that the film comes off as a real example of how show business isn't about the show but rather the business br br i hope that the actual intended project <UNK> man ii gets to see the light of day i think the film makers did a fine job on it with what little they had to work with and all that they had to overcome to complete it
<START> this is an excellent documentary about a story i hadn't heard about before the first solo non stop <UNK> race around the world took place in 1968 <UNK> and involved a handful of <UNK> it's a truly fascinating story about man vs nature and man vs himself the story focuses on donald the tragic figure in this story the film <UNK> combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their <UNK> the story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of donald this is one of the best documentaries of the past few years it has true human emotion in it as the men face this almost impossible task of <UNK> the world non stop on their own
<START> after repeatedly saying how brilliant so many columbo episodes are it's time to honour an episode with maximum points <UNK> in black is not 100 percent perfect but it's certainly more than 90 percent maybe <UNK> or <UNK> br br last week i reviewed just married and compared it <UNK> to meet the parents well here's one of the parents <UNK> <UNK> in a much earlier role as the wife of famous <UNK> conductor alex <UNK> played by the legend that is john cassavetes alex has been having an affair with jennifer wells a girl in the orchestra not his first affair one suspects she is <UNK> alex to leave his wife but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight instead he <UNK> a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide br br enter columbo and guess what it takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide it doesn't take much longer for columbo to connect alex to the victim and soon he's following him around wherever he goes even though columbo is certain alex is his man it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads none of which columbo really <UNK> before he has the vital piece of evidence br br along the way there are some top notch extra characters ranging from the <UNK> young <UNK> of jennifer wells and the english mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on <UNK> street through to the <UNK> looking <UNK> player who nearly finds himself <UNK> up for the murder he had also been seeing jennifer wells the busy girl and there's even a brief cameo from <UNK> from the police academy films as with leslie <UNK> in lady in waiting it's impossible to take him seriously i bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the <UNK> aren't you br br but it's <UNK> <UNK> john cassavetes and peter falk who steal the show here <UNK> is absolutely divine as mrs <UNK> from the moment she spots alex jennifer <UNK> number from memory she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was it's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust alex despite her <UNK> telling her something is very very wrong columbo doesn't help matters by <UNK> her game of <UNK> to ask her questions about <UNK> relations with members of his orchestra br br as for john cassavetes well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as columbo villains because he could have been up there with jack cassidy and patrick <UNK> as one of the all time <UNK> of the show but this performance is superb he's another one who falls into the highly irritated category losing all patience with columbo rather than <UNK> him and <UNK> him despite this when the game is finally up he does <UNK> acknowledge <UNK> genius br br well it's a really really fantastic show it loses a couple of very small points for its rather <UNK> view of classical music as <UNK> by many of the posters here but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the <UNK> and at least the music is good dramatic and exciting br br finally if you haven't come across it there is an absolutely amazing clip of john cassavetes and peter falk on the dick <UNK> show from the early 70s i'm totally convinced steve <UNK> watched this clip and based alan <UNK> on it everything about the clip resembles knowing me knowing you from the <UNK> introduction to the total <UNK> of <UNK> by his guests even the orchestra get in on the act playing circus music while falk cassavetes and their friend ben <UNK> fool about and <UNK> the host br br it might not be strictly relevant to this review but the <UNK> show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between peter falk and john cassavetes it's clear to see from the quality of <UNK> in black just how well the pair worked together
<START> ring ring have been horror directors <UNK> how may we help you i mean hello my name is <UNK> call me by my <UNK> r d okay mr r d what seems to be the problem well the reviews on my latest movie <UNK> help were all negative and harsh and frankly i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well okay mr r d and why do you suppose that is well i gained fame and a well deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage <UNK> of cannibals <UNK> a film crew and another one about relentless thugs <UNK> wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven but <UNK> help revolves on  never mind no no mr r d go ahead and tell me what the film is about um it's about a <UNK> possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her ah i see that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as <UNK> as cannibals or <UNK> but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film right oh yeah um what do you mean by that well isn't the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror or perhaps it's all just happening in the mind of your female heroine um it's just about a phone going <UNK> and murdering people with the <UNK> <UNK> electricity or even ordinary <UNK> interesting mr r d but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie you see i figured the slowly <UNK> phone mystery plot wouldn't be that important or relevant so i just concentrated on <UNK> all possible phone gimmicks i could think of phone gimmicks what do you mean you know like wind blowing through the horn mind <UNK> <UNK> tones and turn tables <UNK> into the air very original mr r d but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that in the end people expect a reasonable <UNK> of all these events oh but there is it all has to do with negative and <UNK> energy if i remember correctly it's all a bit fuzzy i admit <UNK> i see oh well as they always say a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story did you at least process some of your regular <UNK> into the film so that your fans at least recognize your style i tried lord knows i tried but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone that's a pity indeed mr r d but what about sex everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril yes but  but what mr r d well to tell you the truth we kind of promoted <UNK> help as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover but in reality there's no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless mr r d now i'm really disappointed that's just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises i know i know and i'm ashamed but i just wanted everybody to rent <UNK> help and love it well to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few <UNK> decisions without it affecting his her career immediately but be more <UNK> next time and do some research first okay mr r d i will thank you you're welcome tell me have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already yeah as a matter a fact i do i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous <UNK> machine doesn't that sound fascinating hello hello
<START> mpaa rating pg 13 br br my rating 10 and up br br my rating 9 5 10 br br william h macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of mr <UNK> he makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him the story starts out as a comedy and slowly but <UNK> becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that macy masters i couldn't take my eyes off this film even after it ended and i couldn't <UNK> it ended when it did a must to see br br this paragraph may be considered a spoiler by some br br after you watch the film look at the plot this way the are the united states as a whole and the <UNK> meat <UNK> plays is the people in the united states who are anti br br this was a very enjoyable film and would <UNK> to anyone i saw in the street
<START> i am a big gone with the wind nut but i was disappointed that both gone with the wind the movie and scarlett the mini series are so different from the books gone with the wind left so many things out in the movie that were in the book and they did the same with scarlett both were good movies but i really liked both books better there were so many characters left out of scarlett and the ages of some characters didn't seem to match up with the book the time lines don't match up either scarlett realizes she is pregnant on the ship to ireland in the book but she realizes it when she is throwing up while in also sally is made out to be an ugly monkey like woman in the book and the movie casted jean smart to play her who is obviously not an ugly woman over all scarlett is a good movie and it helps anyone who was disappointed in the way gone with the wind ended to see what might have happened if margaret mitchell had lived to write a sequel herself
<START> this is an important historical film since it was the the first all talking feature film br br the film was made for a mere 23 000 dollars br br it <UNK> over a million dollars upon its release br br this film all so helped define the gangster <UNK> that were to become the bread and <UNK> of the <UNK> studio in the 1930's br br the popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part <UNK> predecessor the jazz singer the film deserves its place in history and not as a mere <UNK> br br the only actor who might be remember today that is in it was eugene palette
<START> i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie the acting was horrific i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent <UNK> i will never look at them the same again keanu reeves and dan <UNK> were not a surprise everyone knows they never could act thankfully only dan attempted an accent his accent was a disaster as expected i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from <UNK> i hope this review helps anyone who is <UNK> about what to do with their precious time the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read
<START> first of all i just wanna say that i'm a very big <UNK> fan i love the anime and the manga stories also the first movie just confirmed that <UNK> is all about great fun great action great story but then came the 2nd movie i was very hyped because the first movie turned out great but it didn't satisfy me one bit the story was lame action wasn't all that great especially compared to the anime series same goes for the quality of animation i found it very poorly could the story get any <UNK> any where's the of <UNK> not once does he turn demon i mean come on my advice is see the series until episode <UNK> then it's just <UNK> and then read the manga because that's still great ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future br br all and all i gave it a 4 just because it's <UNK>
<START> while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution such as <UNK> and ten days that <UNK> the world i did not particularly enjoy this one this was mostly due to the annoying and artsy way that the director chose to shoot the film while <UNK> <UNK> in its editing style this movie used similar techniques with a lot less <UNK> in some places the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish plus and this was truly annoying the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over the top what i mean by zombies is that to illustrate just how depressed and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> were the people stand like <UNK> in many scenes and they stand like this <UNK> for a very long period of time while the evil <UNK> and of the masses walk by <UNK> a break this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the <UNK> direction br br by the way the dvd for this film is improved somewhat if you leave the audio commentary on this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights
<START> a film for mature educated audiences br br i saw random hearts in an advance screening shortly before its north american release this romantic drama was quite a treat i'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise but the <UNK> has some very uplifting strong points in its favor br br all time box office draw harrison ford star wars <UNK> of the lost <UNK> the fugitive air force one <UNK> games is at the top of his game as the <UNK> and desperate internal affairs officer dutch ford's very subdued nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss betrayal this is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for harrison ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters next year harrison ford returns to action first for director robert <UNK> forrest <UNK> back to the future in his summer 2000 thriller what lies beneath and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of tom the sum of all fears will be harrison ford's third outing as cia <UNK> jack ryan br br director sydney <UNK> out of africa the firm <UNK> has a supporting role in this feature as a political <UNK> to scott <UNK> <UNK> it's a very sharp energetic portrayal for <UNK> not only is sydney <UNK> a gifted director he is also one of the most believable natural and charming actors around see eyes wide shut as well br br <UNK> scott thomas the english patient the horse <UNK> shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or <UNK> to be considered sexy this is one of her better films and she gives a tremendously crafted and <UNK> performance that works well opposite ford's quiet man <UNK> br br the subplots work wonderfully especially the subplot involving ford's character's investigation into police corruption look for a chilling effective turn by heat actor dennis <UNK> who plays detective george the <UNK> to overcome in investigation into police corruption br br the rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight charles s <UNK> whose long <UNK> for a film leading role goes to show that he is one of the best character actors around and bonnie hunt who i find extremely solid in this production steals most of her scenes with that wonderful charming smile as wendy judd br br the technical side of <UNK> thriller is top from dave <UNK> the firm perfectly surreal feeling <UNK> score to <UNK> <UNK> a river runs through it crisp photography to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh despite the film's unfortunate <UNK> premise br br i highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery well paced plot character driven stories and romance all rolled into one this is a terrific story about betrayal forgiveness it also features one of the most surprising yet poignant and certain to be controversial endings for a harrison ford film in recent times random hearts is definitely one of the better films of the year br br 1 2 out of or 8 5 out of 10 0
<START> this movie is beyond horrible avoid at all costs i want my hour and 20 minutes back br br not funny at all you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once <UNK> <UNK> out of the <UNK> like a <UNK> each one getting more annoying as the last and not <UNK> to the comedy or plot general comedy not this movie in general br br all in all its a lame a 5 watered down <UNK> out cold ish movie but tremendously awful the movie focuses around two groups of a city and how obviously dumb is that where the two <UNK> have battles with each other story is much like a 4 year <UNK> bed time story without all the <UNK> and stupid jokes br br movie 1 10 because you can't give any lower scores
<START> the book of life was rather like a short <UNK> the <UNK> for hartley's next full length movie br br this movie doesn't need to be seen on the big screen watch it with a few friends who are hal hartley or wayne wang fans or better still try to <UNK> some <UNK>
<START> essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you depending on how much you want them to in opening up the red green show for the big screen the filmmakers <UNK> the <UNK> charm carefully <UNK> over a <UNK> worth of episodes set in and around <UNK> in favor of a <UNK> photographed road movie with a ghastly faux hollywood big musical score and profoundly boring storyline that's not <UNK> with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the tv series br br having <UNK> a <UNK> that keeps most of the members of <UNK> <UNK> for most of the film and requires virtually everyone concerned to be <UNK> mean to the <UNK> harold who's the hero of the film the usually <UNK> red being <UNK> in this incarnation to nothing more than the role of head harold <UNK> the only performers who really get to shine are patrick <UNK> and peter as harold and ranger who deliver <UNK> large screen versions of their small screen characters
<START> the first 1 3 of this movie i loved and thought it was going to be one of <UNK> best films i loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world sight unseen especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the real pen pal so she could take her place she then <UNK> out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared i was really hooked and wanted to see more br br and then the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb despite her coming from new an island in the pacific and he from reunion an island in the indian ocean when he goes on a trip to the south of france he stumbles upon her almost immediately hmm odds are 000 000 to 1 but he finds her then instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police he <UNK> her even when she <UNK> what she has done okay this is tough to believe but okay but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him no one is that stupid yes the character catherine <UNK> plays is quite beautiful but come on folks this is just silly plus if he only wanted her as a sex object then why would he do this for a woman who is often <UNK> and completely selfish and evil br br this movie due to it's very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings unless you are a die hard <UNK> fan try another film even one of <UNK> just not this one
<START> nemesis 3 is the worst movie what i have ever seen i think that nemesis 3 was only 30 minutes long and that movie was so boo <UNK> ring when that movie ends and i saw word nemesis 4 i thought i will not watch that movie never again
<START> well how to start i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldn't quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it now i do br br after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the <UNK> apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls no wonder they didn't pay enough to <UNK> to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark <UNK> awesome br br other than that this film is completely predictable the actors are mainly forever b stars and even the good ones are being <UNK> horribly the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel the first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating to detail their gold heist all in all lots of noise about nothing br br i think <UNK> <UNK> is good and ed norton could be more as he's been before apart from donald <UNK> look i'm here too appearing in the beginning i'd say this movie ought to have a pass if you're above 18 all over it
<START> loved the shots of <UNK> dallas phoenix etc just single buildings with the name in block letters on the roof and the <UNK> <UNK> and the well dressed passengers fast forward 75 years br br but what really got to me was the hammer and <UNK> <UNK> and what appeared to be a chinese <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> seat on the <UNK> side of the <UNK> remember when the mutual <UNK> neil and jill encounter says that become a general in a chinese rebel army that based on the hammer and <UNK> could only have been the people's revolutionary army of <UNK> <UNK> dung never mind the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> in bed would that <UNK> and that reference have survived during the cold war br br additional observation 12 27 this film of the 30's with the soviet <UNK> may must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in hollywood and much of america during the depression adds to the historical value of this terrific film br br also i liked the american dream aspects of two guys from taking at least part of the world by storm red blooded literally and <UNK> in <UNK> case american boys br br others have commented more <UNK> than i on the etc i loved it all br br this gem deserved more than the mere 1 5 stars <UNK> and co rated it on tcm if only for recording parts of american history of the early 30s
<START> <UNK> is a disgrace to many things to lucille ball to a story which has been told better many times over and to the musical genre altogether ms ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily <UNK> <UNK> arthur is good but it is not enough the production is very shoddy and cheap looking the songs are sub par and nearly every joke <UNK> also lucy couldn't dance well so the music had to be <UNK> down to a pace avoid at all costs but do see the delightful <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie a few years ago and man i never want to golf again i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved and i'm not talking about <UNK> stuff like <UNK> a <UNK> no no based on what i've seen here they shamelessly massacre policemen and <UNK> alike on <UNK> country club grounds judge would be spinning in his grave and do they <UNK> for said sins no no based on what i have seen here the typical response by a <UNK> ninja is to take over the body of a <UNK> female <UNK> and seek revenge i find this morally <UNK> and needless to say after viewing this nonsense i not only stopped <UNK> and talking on the <UNK> but also decided to stop feeding the homeless
<START> now don't get me wrong i love bad movies no i adore bad movies <UNK> 2 <UNK> painful <UNK> the hands of fate just watch go guru the mad monk is that traffic noise in the medieval background ok so that's clear but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better but didn't make it why not well it would be easy to blame the plot but <UNK> we've seen worse there weren't too many holes and <UNK> i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that <UNK> kill a film the effects aren't bad if you completely ignore the last scene the monster is ok the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong well i'd love to blame it on the look a like <UNK> so i will comedy and horror are difficult to mix well bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem i <UNK> this guy from the moment he stuck his head up literally the <UNK> of the overly meek adam becomes annoying so annoying that you lose belief that the <UNK> of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of why are bad movies fun well you have great fun <UNK> holes in them laughing at the script all the <UNK> etc this film doesn't make the <UNK> category of <UNK> <UNK> because its just bad due to being annoying <UNK> said don't bother go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it i promise fade to <UNK> of
<START> one of those tv films you saw in the seventies that scared the hell out of you when you were a kid but still gives you an eerie feeling no great actors or expensive production but <UNK> that phone rings
<START> i read the comments about this movie before watching it and wasn't expecting much but as a b movie it's a curiosity i guess you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy this kind of thing but i seriously thought it was awesome people should watch it just for the experience because it's totally one of a kind don't expect much of it the acting is poor transitions were obviously done on a pc etc definitely a b movie but nonetheless really worth checking out very funny mild gore and some questionable themes so probably not something to show your <UNK> but for the more adventurous viewer i'd say it's a must see
<START> this was a letdown in many ways the location filming in ireland though quite beautiful at times cannot save this uninspired flick greg <UNK> and alexandra paul as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who <UNK> a haunted mansion just aren't interesting characters paul towards the end of the film becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her <UNK> naked body although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing <UNK> one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co executive producer roger <UNK> much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of <UNK> in all its <UNK> <UNK> any attempt at true tension and suspense and as a result chills are thrown out the window in this low budget bust if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a <UNK> skip this unless you are <UNK> and think plot is secondary rent another low budget ghost story if you can find it titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be this was a wasted opportunity
<START> despite all it's <UNK> of style and cinematic invention this is basically another serial killer thriller following the same sort of <UNK> <UNK> by such old favourites as silence of the <UNK> team of cops follows the trail of particularly nasty murders someone else gets taken and they somehow have to find out where they are before it's too late only in this case the only person who knows the killer himself <UNK> played by vincent <UNK> is in a coma and we need psychologist jennifer sci fi mind <UNK> machine to get into his head and force him to tell all this is where the film gets all new and different as we enter via a 21st century cgi update of dr who's <UNK> favourite the trendy time tunnel a kind of <UNK> y weird world of scary crazy stuff going on all over the place ruled over by <UNK> now a kind of <UNK> of his twisted mental world inside his <UNK> body the inside the mind sequences are well realised and often pretty stunning all the leads perform adequately the <UNK> is to the max if you like that kind of thing but the hype around the whole thing led to a disappointment for me as i had expected something completely new and unlike anything ever done before not this fairly successful <UNK> of serial killer and special effect horror genre <UNK> sometimes horrifying often pretty a fairly gripping story told with care and attention by talented film people but by no means the great leap into the unknown it has been <UNK> as
<START> this excruciatingly boring and unfunny movie made me think that chaplin was the real hitler as only someone as evil as him could torture people with this tripe i saw this movie <UNK> which only made the suffering inflicted by this atrocity more severe this movie is nothing but a pathetic repetitive movie which instead of inducing two hours of laughter it induced two hours of <UNK> <UNK> after the first 10 minutes of this i began wishing that gas would start <UNK> from the <UNK> of the theatre br br if i could give it a zero out of ten i would happily do so avoid at all costs
<START> in all the episodes i never saw any real action or drama or comedy br br the plot is so repetitive br br somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it br br i watched about 30 of these i realized there is no drama nobody ever loses a <UNK> or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air plane br br there are no car chases or explosions not even a horse race with old <UNK> br br all those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree what gives no no axe murders no gun old <UNK> in bad suits just you have an old tea set and it came from the country of germany back in blah blah blah br br i'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it but no it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some <UNK> <UNK> or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in boston or china during the <UNK> <UNK> big deal br br can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for <UNK> is there no alien <UNK> that will <UNK> the entire floor who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake this is about as entertaining as watching paint dry only with commentary br br there's no sex there's no comedy or romance no action no suspense no action no drama no mystery or martial arts br br this show sucks what ever happened to <UNK> wearing <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> from a futuristic weapon <UNK> <UNK> more like grab a <UNK> and <UNK> and go to sleep show
<START> all grown up is basically a spin off and not much else of the original <UNK> cartoon that featured the babies tommy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and phil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and later <UNK> sister and <UNK> brother i grew up with <UNK> and thought it was a great cartoon it had excellent humor nice stories and the show's creators <UNK> <UNK> were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies the new show all grown up tries to <UNK> the magic of the original cartoon i was disappointed when i saw it i found the all grown up <UNK> just annoying and the whole pre teen acting mature trying to be popular that applied to unfortunately all of the characters dull and washed out there still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of <UNK> look ten years from their age in the original show overall this show is and only watchable if a you're a die hard fan of the <UNK> b have never seen the original show c you're a pre teen that has nothing to do or d your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show this show is not that good it doesn't compare to the older <UNK> episodes in quality humor and everything else
<START> i so much enjoyed this little musical fantasy i bought a copy to share with my friends it is a pleasant and <UNK> change from our mundane lives i believe that we can all benefit from an active fantasy life one of joy and <UNK> i <UNK> recommend it br br the performance is excellent and the music uplifting
<START> <UNK> 1984 i was young and stupid and just developing a taste for those exotic <UNK> whilst living in a <UNK> in moss side with the most unbelievable case of <UNK> <UNK> br br after a few of those this show was <UNK> material i was an avid fan then i'd look down at the floor or up at the walls or just about anywhere and see my very own collection of little <UNK> about br br not sure if it was the chemical <UNK> but i remember thinking at the time that the overt <UNK> of the show was fantastic it was my second favourite thing on tv at the time 1 was the season of luis <UNK> movies being shown by channel 4 radical art lives on br br also you gotta that theme tune i swear i'll never drink no more
<START> a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line as i've often said about this flick if you don't get it you're way lame classic lines such as i've got this <UNK> and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it you're a nurse what can you give me for it nurse replies all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring great sound track the classic <UNK> got nothing to hide stays surprisingly close to the original plot not that the original stays in the way of a joke haven't met anyone with an iq over <UNK> that doesn't find it hysterical br br
<START> what a mess of a movie if it <UNK> for eric roberts and susan <UNK> performances this movie would be a total waste a very muddled plot and phony dialogue eric roberts debut where did his career go from this movie on nowhere but down
<START> i was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told and as i am huge fan of love i bought the tickets and sat myself in the theatre after 90 minutes i left the theatre with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing of the film i was appalled at the story itself that two people can love each other but be so afraid as to never act it i just couldn't go passed the language <UNK> and the cultural <UNK> the second time i ran into it i was in a different mood no longer had any expectation and had more patience more relaxed mind to see the film and as soon as i opened my eyes i discovered the love the beauty of the film i went beyond the language and the love story and saw the acting not even for a moment did i ever felt like they were acting and the cinematography the first time i heard a definition of what a film is i was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs shots and this is the film to match the description almost every shot has an idea behind it and combined with the music and the light effects the result is just a masterpiece and a masterpiece is just something that you must have in your collection of films
<START> i feel at a loss so brilliant is this film <UNK> is a writer a <UNK> and while an excellent filmmaker his greatness lies in his writing and red is his <UNK> this film is a study of the <UNK> judgement in the creation of his fictional world of how an artist can attempt to remake life even his own thru his art even as he cannot escape the knowledge that no matter how he involves himself in his story it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world still <UNK> with its <UNK> and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake and magically all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story this pre judged destiny if i had to choose i might <UNK> this the greatest film ever made
<START> this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the <UNK> i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with basically this is the deal two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for <UNK> son to get a bone <UNK> transplant from convicted killer keaton is it worth it no
<START> positively ridiculous film br br if doris roberts shirley jones and shirley knight <UNK> in these kinds of films they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full time br br while the idea that a 35 year old <UNK> who works on video games loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight this is <UNK> dealt with imagine the 3 <UNK> getting high on stuff that <UNK> alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her <UNK> br br the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his <UNK> habit along with the others br br terrible best describes this miserable film
<START> as a christian i found this movie to be completely embarrassing the actors sucked the writing sucked the cinematography sucked and the story was so typical i couldn't say this is a great witnessing tool because i'd be too embarrassed to show any of my <UNK> friends hollywood has much better stuff and that's because they <UNK> the best into it christians put out sh <UNK> work and think it's ok because it's for the lord in the old testament people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to god david or <UNK> i don't remember spent what would be equal to about 50 billion in todays money on building a temple for god but these days spending what would appear to be about 30 000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic it's the person not the product that affects someone don't waste your time trying to <UNK> your friends with this waste of an hour and a half if you want to make a positive impact with people show them movies like the matrix american beauty braveheart etc movies that have something to say and actually get it into you
<START> interesting premise interestingly worked out the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth but is unable to convey it to others overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie but be prepared for a certain level of suspense
<START> where this movie is faithful to <UNK> vision it is excellent where it <UNK> from <UNK> it is superb it is a tale of family of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan <UNK> speaking of one of the most <UNK> lines in all of cinema he was my father is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic not a perfect motion picture the notorious over dubbing of <UNK> voice by glenn close is <UNK> and only in terms of a very british error but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to sir ralph richardson
<START> is simply the best film i've ever seen it's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place some scenes are not nice or beautiful but the camera never <UNK> or <UNK> this is exactly what's happening here the camera is used to <UNK> to disgrace and to <UNK> there is no magic flow here no sense of greatness or respect instead some scenes are <UNK> together without greater purpose or plan the music is disturbing just as i rated the best film ever made this one is the worst it's a pure movie too but this is the negative form exactly that which should not be done
<START> ok i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000 but i did see the movie so i figured i would leave a comment on it i just love once again how joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and <UNK> are just getting the oscar winning roles left and right is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good it seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects a story that didn't make much sense and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities this is one of my favorite mst3k episodes simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and i'll explain why in a moment br br natalie and <UNK> are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work things over but since <UNK> is in upper lower class and natalie is in middle class it just ain't gonna work but on the way home they and <UNK> friends get into a car accident and now the angel of death is after them to meet his <UNK> of but also it seems like he's had some kind of other life relationship with natalie and just can't seem to move on so now natalie and <UNK> must race against the ever appearing five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives br br well i guess <UNK> was wrong when he sang that there was a <UNK> to heaven i wonder if black was wrong too lol basically there are a lot of plot holes in this movies like no one can see the characters and they can't be killed yet somehow they can still press buttons and open doors the angel of death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself was just a lousy film that was rushed and makes you just feel so bad for joe the under appreciated sheen brother br br 2 10
<START> these critics need to find a new job this movie is based on a true story which has made history it illustrates beautifully how even in the <UNK> of war and tragedy love can <UNK> all the breathtaking of <UNK> has captured my heart and soul as if i too were there the blue eyed cage the delightful <UNK> were amazing together they perfectly portrayed how a <UNK> couple can only become closer in the time of war this movie will touch your heart like it did mine you must go see it
<START> everyone is a genius in something albert <UNK> was a genius in science william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the <UNK> war on everything are truly comedy geniuses their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast <UNK> abc after a small start as a satire newspaper the <UNK> popularity when given their own television show never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for chris taylor going on sunrise a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f k off creating a fake and driving into high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about <UNK> by following <UNK> around yelling out no gary no no gary no while controversial the show is funny and worthy of running for years to come
<START> if there's one word i can associate to this movie its it must be embarrassing to everyone associated with the movie to actually watch it in a theatre everything the script screenplay dialogues song lyrics direction shoddy lousy br br saw this movie when i was a kid liked it then mainly because it was a fantasy a superhero movie its a not so explored genre in hindi cinema the attempt deserves credit but that's all there is to it <UNK> kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry in making the movie can't understand the reason behind casting <UNK> as hindi speaking characters who can't even get the sync right nothing to say about the dubbing the screenplay is terrible the editing even more if one follows the dialogues closely one can <UNK> <UNK> wrong sentences which completely alter the intended meaning nothing special about the music br br the biggest embarrassment must be for the <UNK> board there are a couple of <UNK> slip scenes in the movie one of which is absolutely clear so much so that i can't even think of a metaphor the director missed them the editing team missed it and the <UNK> board missed it too so much for the no <UNK> exposure on screen <UNK> the officials probably fell asleep while watching the movie br br can't think of why amitabh went with the role it might be because he was a good friend of the <UNK> but the role hardly has anything for him with wonderful roles in hum and behind him he couldn't have followed it up with a worse one there are a couple of heroic scenes really worthy ones but otherwise they're embarrassingly unbelievable arrow catching for instance it probably could've been better with cgi but it was <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> do not exactly set the screen on fire kapoor and <UNK> kapoor give an inspired performance but their scope is limited <UNK> <UNK> is his usual self in the role of a fairy tale villain letting out the villainous laugh every now and then br br on the whole an interesting concept could have been a lot more better
<START> i've always been fascinated by who would know that it will go further than beyond in ninja iii it's fun creepy and intriguing a ninja gets shot up by the police and uses his spirit for revenge the victim a lovely young woman named christie <UNK> <UNK> she falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting the love scene where she <UNK> the on her body knocked me out the death gets the attention of another in japan named <UNK> sho <UNK> he comes to america not only to save christie but to put the ninja back to the grave simply because he put out <UNK> left eye with a throwing star the fight scenes were excellent i liked the part when the <UNK> falls on <UNK> and he <UNK> it with his foot and when he was caught he tells the officer christie was involved with that everything will be fine rule of thumb never under <UNK> a ninja he took out the other cops without killing them and he did his thing without worry of course did her best trying to put the ninja in his place for using her a tool for revenge it was a good movie great for martial arts buffs 3 out of 5 stars
<START> chop shop written and directed by <UNK> man push <UNK> <UNK> in character driven studies in <UNK> style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day without anyone ever really <UNK> they are there in new york br br these are people who have been pushed to the very <UNK> of society they exist in a sort of grey world many of them <UNK> whose legal status in america is appears somewhat <UNK> where do they come from how did they get there how do they cope where will they end up these are not feel good stories as such but stories about survival at its most basic day to day level br br <UNK> is one such street kid he has no education and <UNK> anyway he can to save money he is also not beyond turning to petty <UNK> mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister we see him in the early scenes <UNK> a safe house looking for her but not having any real success a young friend carlos gets him a job in a chop shop in the shadows of <UNK> baseball stadium eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money he dreams of buying a food van and setting up a <UNK> business with his older sister br br shoots all his films on location there is nothing glossy or <UNK> over about them this is life as these people have to live it in the raw lt is not pretty although it is never ominous and the slightly <UNK> air that hangs over much of the film is the same one that hangs over these <UNK> everyday lives br br the script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in is outstanding in the lead role and <UNK> gives solid support as the older sister
<START> this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever i say this because he is made out to be the hero when in my opinion everything he does in the whole movie <UNK> up people's lives and causes problems he can do nothing right yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to he has temper <UNK> at all the wrong times he has all the wrong <UNK> on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed he is too <UNK> too <UNK> too macho too assuming makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense br br it's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago the detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son however all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime drama and twists it's made for tv what do you expect br br anyhow the movie is fairly entertaining johnny <UNK> is very young in this one and has an awful 80's <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that is all we get to see of him br br for some reason the out of print vhs version of this sells for 40 in online it must be for johnny <UNK> <UNK> only it couldn't be because of the plot it couldn't be br br
<START> this movie lacks in everything except bobby <UNK> who in his own standards is mediocre no one in this movie has come close to act in a single scene is complete fake in her acting br br the great <UNK> <UNK> has a guest appearance and is better in those 2 minutes than bobby in the whole movie the music <UNK> compliment the movie br br that well the contrast in music between bobby and is not <UNK> that well great concept gone completely wrong the movie <UNK> have a proper ending please don't waste your time as i did on this movie
<START> great just great the west coast got dirty harry callahan the east coast got <UNK> burt reynolds plays <UNK> in <UNK> machine and i enjoyed every minute of it playing a maverick <UNK> cop in <UNK> <UNK> is just what everyone wants instead of suspension he's sent to vice squad like in the dirty harry movies or any other cop movies the captain is always going to be the jerk when i was a kid i was curious what that movie meant <UNK> machine well i knew who played <UNK> i wonder what his machine was it was his group of fellow cops after <UNK> the murder he goes all out to find the <UNK> when it turns out to be a big time mob boss <UNK> doesn't play around when he gets the other prostitute into safety <UNK> fights back hard and good despite losing a finger to the thug and i also like the part where the bad gets blown out of the building through a plate glass window that was the bomb randy <UNK> street life really put the movie in the right mood and the movie itself is really a great hit to me always rating 4 out of 5 stars
<START> between sweeping extraordinary scenes within a <UNK> of indian locations and a plot which is bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality this highly moving film is a must see for those who love a good romance adventure and by this i mean good not a hollywood or bollywood easy and contrived happy ending east meets west in a different take on the buddy film the performances are inspired and brilliant the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining engaging and poignant without a trace of <UNK> or cheap <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a sweet film that won't <UNK> your teeth see it
<START> so let's begin br br the movie itself is as original as <UNK> movies would usually appear br br my intention to see it was certainly being one of my favourite actresses she is as lovely as usual this <UNK> br br i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow br br the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array br br recommend with confidence
<START> with the war not going well for the soviet union <UNK> accepted <UNK> from the <UNK> and used the prisoners as shock troops this is the story of one such <UNK> there are petty crooks political prisoners soldiers kicked out of other <UNK> gray haired veterans of the white army plus some dangerous criminals br br they are thrown into battle ill <UNK> <UNK> and face the threat of the <UNK> if they show signs of <UNK> or failure br br the special effects are <UNK> and many of the minor characters are one dimensional but the overall story is very human and riveting br br i have not seen a version with subtitles or dubbing viewing the show required liberal use of the pause button and explanations from a native <UNK> of russian
<START> this may just be the worst movie ever produced worst plot worst acting worst special effects be prepared if you want to watch this the only way to get enjoyment out of it is to light a match and burn the tape of it knowing it will never fall into the hands of any sane person again
<START> the <UNK> and almost unbearable melancholy of music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir in her voice and magical presence lies the exquisite agony of the an art form of which i was unaware until seeing this film br br for me the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary lies in the fact that the filmmaker <UNK> the temptation to and simply allows us to share in the <UNK> and elegant passion of this icon there seems to be an inevitable between the portuguese and american blues br br documentary filmmaking at its best <UNK> us to a previously unknown reality and having been allowed this glimpse we are transformed br br sr de <UNK>
<START> this is an <UNK> new clothes situation someone needs to say that's not a funny and original etc etc film that is an inferior film don't waste your money on it the film is trashy and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash they are all too realistically only themselves they have no lines they don't act the american dream is not to create shoddy no quality films or anything else shoddy and of no quality it is to achieve something of quality and thereby success only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood it can't have been made in hollywood can it would try to any kind of quality to this film it's worse than ed woods another film about a film maker without standards these films shouldn't have been made and you shouldn't go see american movie
<START> i saw this one on the late late late late show back when mst3k was just a <UNK> in joel eye i had the <UNK> of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be i didn't know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run to the ends of the earth in about an hour and a half thank god her father gave such specific directions and then take days to make it back to the castle with help i didn't know that a sword wielding barbarian type could run into the forest and create a and flash <UNK> bombs in under 30 seconds i had no idea how disjointed a movie could be br br it's a bad thing children a very bad thing if you enjoy bad movies go for it
<START> an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the mom's boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book 3 8 <UNK> olds don't waste your money your time or your good judgement
<START> i'm sitting around going through movie <UNK> and not really seeing anything i want to see my <UNK> keeps saying something like broadcast news that's what i want something smart and funny with adult ideas and great acting and writing and a directorial style that doesn't call attention to itself this may well be <UNK> best performance is this or the big chill to my mind however eccentric hurt is smart and to play an <UNK> person without making sure <UNK> <UNK> the audience knows <UNK> <UNK> hey i'm not stupid well that's fine acting right there hunter is note perfect and albert brooks is a revelation and he can read and sing at the same time great great work br br
<START> this movie which i just discovered at the video store has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a <UNK> it's easy to see why the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the <UNK> at <UNK> island has flashes of being a very good film but ultimately is <UNK> down by the story focusing on stan and daniel rather than on their homeless friend <UNK> <UNK> is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it with the ghostly images of <UNK> island however writer <UNK> and director richard are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on <UNK> one flashback in a music store where <UNK> has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone but in the end not much two many drawn out scenes of annoyance such as inside the building rating 4 out of 10
<START> except for the appearance of talented austin powers <UNK> richard this <UNK> was your run of the mill movie spoof dated movie references will not help audiences that may come across this <UNK> in future watch for <UNK> austin powers in the hot <UNK> it's a hoot and a half br br poor special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous <UNK> in skimpy outfits so at least that should keep one entertained if that's what thrills you br br for my money i would rent the dvd of classic spoofs such as airplane or <UNK> man from mars
<START> flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot <UNK> one of the best american films i have seen this year neil <UNK> terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while <UNK> <UNK> and morgan <UNK> authentic performances give it a soul violent provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending chris rock greg kinnear aaron <UNK> glover and allison all give <UNK> tongue in cheek performances the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap but better and smarter 9 out of 10
<START> this is definitely one of the better mel brooks movies along with <UNK> although i will openly admit to not having watched many others at least yet it's very silly and thoroughly funny there are hardly more than a few minutes throughout the entire two hour run time where you aren't entertained almost all of the gags have a great comical effect few of them fall flat i saw this movie right after seeing and reviewing spy hard and comparing these two spoof movies i realize exactly of how high quality this movie really is it's funny from start to finish none of the comedy is overdone or boring the music is marvelous as is the choreography of both dancing and fighting the acting is pretty much what you would normally expect from this type of movie <UNK> is a great comedian and makes a good robin the plot is typical robin hood more or less everything from the legend is fit into this movie and <UNK> <UNK> if you like mel brooks or you're just a fan of silly humor or you're just dying to watch a good parody of the legend of robin hood this is definitely the film for you the hbo first look special on the film is also worth watching and in that you may want to keep watching throughout the credits too i'd recommend it to any fan of mel brooks movies and to people who enjoy silly humor 7 10
<START> when i first watched this movie i thought it was a very strange movie but i know that the director almost always has a purpose when he makes a movie so i decided to watch it one more time the second time i watched it i realised that albert <UNK> is a very talented and a very original film maker in the beginning the viewer was told that the movie took place a decade after the fall of the communism in the eastern europe but they had clothes and cars with a design typical for the 1950's they had <UNK> which i think is a symbol for the futuristic trade i think that it means that the movie's real time is not <UNK> the music in the movie is creating a long music video which tells some parts of the actual story in the lyrics specially for the intro and the br br albert <UNK> is using red and blue back color when he's showing the symbols for communism red and the capitalism and western world blue one can notice that ice t has the name <UNK> communism and that when he's in focus the back color is red the american cop starring burt reynolds is always filmed with blue back color the club where <UNK> and his gang hang out is also with red back color crazy six is between the red and the blue color br br the white little dog that <UNK> had in the beginning <UNK> i think the controlling force <UNK> had the dog in the beginning but the cop took it in the end that <UNK> i guess the fall of communism and the replacement of the <UNK> way of thinking from the western world in eastern europe br br i think crazy six is a very well made movie albert <UNK> creates an sci fi action movie with a depth it's a different but a very special movie about the communism fall in the eastern europe br br i'm looking forward to watch another spectacular movie of albert <UNK>
<START> this may contain spoilers br br where to start on this particular empty <UNK> well it would have been nice if they actually had a plot acting talent decent dialog suspense humor hey even gratuitous sex would have helped this flick unfortunately there was only a lot of gore even that wasn't done well shooting automatic weapons and missing br br there seemed to be no reason to <UNK> the basic premise a native american cursed to protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered with his being <UNK> down by a federal special <UNK> team who dressed in <UNK> most of the time involved <UNK> one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie <UNK> from the group so you can be picked off one by one you'd think this team would know better especially because they are actually the third team sent to investigate the other two teams disappearing without a trace when they finally realize they're being picked off they make one of several stands and fire their weapons only to hit the trees a whole lot tree shot scene repeats endlessly in this movie to save money br br when they're not shooting trees they're tracking this spirit who leaves no trail who knows how they're tracking it and <UNK> a lot of macho <UNK> by the way did i mention that most of this team are women interesting listening to them talk tough not very entertaining but interesting br br all in all you can find better movies in the bargain bin at <UNK>
<START> haha what a great little movie wayne crawford strikes again or rather this was his first big strike a <UNK> entertaining little ball of manic <UNK> energy <UNK> as a psycho killer movie it's actually a brilliant satire on post hippie american culture in country though the movie was actually filmed <UNK> in miami it defies any kind of studio oriented convention or plot device that i can think of sometimes aunt martha does dreadful things may not be a very technically <UNK> movie but it is a wonderful little slice of <UNK> made on the cheap by people who were honest ambitious imaginative and had balls made out of steel it took guts nerve and <UNK> to make this movie which amazingly appears to have stood the test of time this movie is fresh vital alive unforgettable and <UNK> weird enough to recommend to just about anyone with a sense of humor br br i <UNK> up last year during a period of time when i was fascinated by star wayne crawford here billed under his <UNK> scott lawrence a <UNK> of what can only be called <UNK> film making usually of the b grade variety he's a writer producer director and actor all in one probably best known for the 80s teen apocalyptic favorite night of the <UNK> here he plays stanley the pants wearing half of a couple of truly marvelous characters apparently homosexual spree killers on the <UNK> after knocking off some old lady in <UNK> for her jewelry <UNK> screen legend <UNK> <UNK> is completely convincing as paul who poses as <UNK> aunt martha the cross dressing brains of the outfit who has <UNK> stanley into thinking he's committed murder to ensure his loyalty martha looks about as feminine as the sailors from south supporting choir in their <UNK> bikini tops yet somehow nobody seems to notice or care that she is a he has no visible means of <UNK> seems to spend all day <UNK> about where stanley is and <UNK> around the neighborhood in her carrying a <UNK> knife only in america br br as the film opens the two of them have just arrived in florida and set up <UNK> in what looks like ward old house a <UNK> lit designed television home that is so cliché as to be surreal during one memorable scene martha and an <UNK> house guest sit on the couch talk problems and drink <UNK> of <UNK> in what is one of the most mesmerizing ordinary sequences i've ever seen outside of a john waters movie then there's stanley always getting into trouble as he is a <UNK> topped hippie with an <UNK> on his <UNK> who drives a psychedelic painted van that's about as subtle as the <UNK> drinks his milk straight from the <UNK> <UNK> drugs with blond <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in an old <UNK> box for a quick <UNK> <UNK> attract i guess br br but stanley also has a thing about not liking it when the young ladies he gets stoned with try to remove his pants and it always seems to be up to aunt martha to get him out of the trouble that inevitably results the bodies pile up a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> them into using their house as a flop <UNK> birthday cake gets <UNK> and everybody meets down at the local pizza shop before heading to the wood shed on the back property for a <UNK> party where the girls dance in their underwear things get out of hand when one of the neighbors tries to get a bit too <UNK> with martha who naturally prefers to keep people at an <UNK> length when they <UNK> invite themselves over for a nice chat and this is a woman who carries not just a butcher knife but a loaded <UNK> in her slip eventually the strange duo find themselves stuck with a body a baby and no place to go and end up taking <UNK> at an abandoned movie studio where no doubt the technical crew borrowed the equipment used to make the film i just hope they <UNK> asked for <UNK> first and <UNK> up after themselves br br a word of course must be said about stanley and martha paul's relationship since to dance around the fact that the two are at least suggested to be a homosexual couple would be to miss the primary <UNK> of the plot we never see the two of them get intimate and indeed even though stanley <UNK> refers to being <UNK> in one scene their relationship is more <UNK> than sexual it certainly isn't a gay movie with <UNK> female nudity and an air of 70s <UNK> that cannot be denied either stanley paul never their implied sexuality on screen even though the movie certainly would have had the guts to do so if it were important it isn't the story isn't about their sex it's about the bond they share and how weird it is not their being gay but their being the distinct individuals they are who are two of the strangest movie creations ever to inhabit my tv set br br the film is unique it was made for only a few thousand dollars on what look like borrowed studio sets the occasional location work and an couple of public locations they managed to sneak a camera crew into when nobody was looking the dialog is completely bizarre mundane and delightfully <UNK> it's a movie that will take you by surprise not everyone will like it but for those with a taste for low budget american horror thrillers like the night god screamed help me i'm possessed blood <UNK> and children shouldn't play with dead things you've got yourself a winner here br br 8 10 usually i'd say something like deserves a dvd <UNK> but somehow i think doing so would ruin the movie's tacky ambiance and wayne crawford you sir rule
<START> as part of an <UNK> prank julie meg <UNK> of psycho 2 has to spend the night in a <UNK> but karl a master of <UNK> has recently died and been put in there when <UNK> fellow <UNK> sisters where he's <UNK> the real terror starts br br this little flick had a good deal of atmosphere and i enjoyed the build up plus the last twenty minutes are just plain great anyone who's looking for a lost gem of an <UNK> horror movie <UNK> look any further highly under appreciated plus elizabeth daily is adorable br br my grade b br br media <UNK> dvd extras disc 1 commentary with director tom and co writer michael <UNK> and trailers for the being bloody terror just before dawn devil dog disc 2 alternate director's cut that's almost unwatchable due to a bad print behind the scenes <UNK>
<START> now i know why this movie can be bought for so cheap at the video stores i was curious since it had three big name stars yet was among the <UNK> movies that the video apparently can't even give away the answer is it is a film that would attract a very limited audience an over 50 crowd with very liberal sensibilities br br who else who watch robert redford willem dafoe and helen <UNK> give essentially a basic message that cheating on your wife is okay so long as you still love her that's the nice feel good message here particularly at the end at the end of this strange kidnapping story who wrote this script bill <UNK> br br i say strange because the <UNK> is the <UNK> <UNK> dafoe you've ever seen except at the end he his hostage redford frequently which no <UNK> would risk has casual conversations about family matters etc it's all ludicrous well the l a times says it's an intelligent thriller ha ha well that <UNK> what most people know of the l a times for those of you who believe that and haven't seen it i won't spoil it with more of the gigantic holes in this story particularly at the end the fact is it's an insult to anyone with intelligence br br anyway you can't fool all the people all the time as critics have yet to figure out here is another film they <UNK> that <UNK> bombed at the box office and video store
<START> okay so i'm <UNK> and i would like to say that it's time to stop stereotyping <UNK> and making such films some of the actors actresses actually have talent but sadly it wasn't shown much in this film i was <UNK> in my seat when i watched this being quite young at that time my parents dragged me along to see it honestly i could say that i was going to fall asleep and there was this arrogant <UNK> boy whom just got on my nerves overall a boring film and a general waste of the actors' talent i have seen better <UNK> movies than this chicken rice war was good however i cannot believe that this one would be considered a better <UNK> film sorry i wouldn't recommend it
<START> i love this movie first and foremost because of mark <UNK> is in it and secondly because the end <UNK> the means there is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling <UNK> aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie it takes a look at the <UNK> lifestyle that so many hardcore <UNK> lived back in the day perhaps these days they have gotten just smarter it takes through a <UNK> of emotions and has a lot of subtle <UNK> to allow the light through like a diamond this movie shines you won't waste your popcorn on this one semi chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too there's some laughs thrown in too
<START> china white 1989 was <UNK> <UNK> first international film this u k holland hong kong production was shot in english and was slightly edited for the western audience the american wong brothers michael and russell were supposed to star in the film together but due to prior <UNK> was <UNK> so another western actor steven leigh took his spot several hong kong stars such as tommy wong playing a mute and the always creepy william ho appear as well as the director in an interesting cameo spot br br the <UNK> brothers are in holland to run the family business they want to the family business to go <UNK> but the other asian gangs don't want to and see there move as a face saving move to please the <UNK> and want to keep on making money the old fashion way others want to take their business to even a new low by <UNK> drugs and what not after the <UNK> elder is <UNK> down in cold blood the brothers make their move against any family who's not with them can the <UNK> family keep the families from killing one another or while the streets of holland flow with the blood of the innocence and gangsters br br a highly underrated movie i was surprised by how good it was i haven't seen the hong kong version that would be a huge treat for me it's longer and has a lot more stars of the hong kong cinema involved with the production too bad this film isn't available on d v d the video print i saw was washed out and the sound <UNK> wasn't that great br br highly recommended for action fans br br this film takes place before the of drugs br br in holland
<START> i'm not sure whether i like this film or not i think it is creepy and completely weird <UNK> glover as always gave a great performance as i think his performance was really good and one of his best but i don't like the character at all keanu reeves performance was really good and i truly felt for his character over all i think the whole cast gave great performances as felt like the characters were real i disliked some but genuinely felt sorry for others keanu reeves i would like to know if that was the original ending that the film was supposed to have as it didn't end how i expected it to i was disappointed in the ending and i don't feel that it did the rest of the film justice if you are into creepy weird and really well different movies go for this one if you like things that are normal please stay away
<START> the <UNK> and thus second to last short of the <UNK> ones this is the only one quite like this this takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment <UNK> of the matrix and combines them unbelievably well this is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect the tone the animation is a gorgeous breathtaking <UNK> the style which is <UNK> in this is noir the plot is fitting and the story telling as well as the music is spot on the sound in general is fantastic and really helps <UNK> the mood and atmosphere along with the drawings and designs the voice acting is impeccable this is one of only two where people also in the movies <UNK> their roles and both have anne moss who is the only of them appearing in this this is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites this is about ten minutes long the pacing is perfect it never slows down terribly much but it's not overwhelming either the ending could not have been more appropriate for this this shares a nine and a half minutes long making of with kid's story and it's well done and informative i recommend this <UNK> to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of 8 10
<START> this is an action packed film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time i see it the film short of its conclusion demonstrates that in the face of extreme odds it is still possible to <UNK> br br this film is very refreshing and likely to be banned at any moment get a copy of it before the thought police burn every copy they can find they don't want you to have hope for the future or to think you have a chance br br on the other hand should political correctness fail to <UNK> it this would be an excellent movie to release on dvd such a release could contain interviews with the writer and director and related <UNK> i'm sure it would sell some copies and i would be one of the first to buy it br br
<START> leonard can write lyrics but he sure can't sing nor has he had an original idea in his life just a <UNK> from the looks of this nasty little <UNK> piece note that his <UNK> and stewart were involved in the production he didn't know how to live either the woman he loves is only mentioned in passing and no woman is allowed to speak in this nonsensical <UNK> while irving <UNK> was given a credit the other poet interviewed <UNK> <UNK> was to remain <UNK> i come from the generation just after cohen where all the boys seemed to <UNK> him his lack of commitment was probably just calling to them i hadn't realized what a disappointing he was back then i was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt because of his age br br whiny little rich prince and not one memorable line in his <UNK> no dedication to social change outside of the sexual <UNK> br br you don't speak for my generation <UNK> and not for my gender go back to the monastery and stay off the screen br br as for my local public <UNK> i will let them know what i think of them wasting my time on this guy not a has been a never was
<START> if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling <UNK> after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed br br i thought that the characters were well developed <UNK> and <UNK> both portrayed their roles very well yes <UNK> <UNK> can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermore i thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it br br in conclusion good characters great plot poorly written edited ending still go see it
<START> a lot of people say the end did not make sense but it did with the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off having picked up a lot of <UNK> from hundreds of thousands of souls enough to re <UNK> those cells and create new bat creatures it seems they do not have <UNK> sex like vampires of legend br br vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous but killing them with with a shot to force center below the heart is consistent all you can ask for is <UNK> the viewer has to suspend disbelief even for scifi br br the only problem is having to be a sword or stake not bullets that puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci fi so that is a problem br br the only major <UNK> i found is killing the male vampires with the sword but the soul of the girl and go up to the ship i assume the males souls also went up the ship but not shown br br what about all the humans killed do their forces souls go up to the ship as <UNK> <UNK> are does all the <UNK> get <UNK> into one for use as ship sees fit in other words all the human souls that went to the ship could be re <UNK> as bat creatures br br the basic concept is no more ridiculous than star wars force or even re incarnation br br this movie was over the top kitchen sink dawn of the dead meets alien meets dracula but in many ways profound it was also a beautiful love story the beginning and end were <UNK> it both began what is happening to me and ended as a love story br br most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre so what bizarre is an art form as far as being ludicrous it all fits the plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens just killing people maybe they didn't need patrick <UNK> blood to form an image of the girl but it was a very far out surreal scene br br another reason the movie is hated is because of the end but the end fits perfectly with the beginning people are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core its a lover story from start to finish it starts with and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way so it fits perfectly most people are <UNK> on the hero killing the monster and this movie did not end that way which is precisely why i love it br br instead it has a happy ending with the 2 of them going back to ship to be <UNK> way <UNK> than the hero kills monster end but that is exactly why it bombed it was not a straight up horror or even scifi horror at all but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end all those souls <UNK> on the ship and the crystal room <UNK> with new life br br most people can't deal with a love story that is also alien meets dawn of the dead meets dracula
<START> jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor eternal sunshine for example br br however this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny you will sit <UNK> faced throughout this film as it has nothing else to recommend it br br even if you do like <UNK> comedy i am not sure you will find this film amusing i went to see it on a saturday night at 10 <UNK> and the audience was definitely ready to laugh they <UNK> throughout the trailers which weren't particularly funny but when it came to the film <UNK> silence i think it raised about five genuine laughs br br the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but i'm guessing it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters br br the strong point of the film is the hold ups and there was plenty of potential here but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped meanwhile you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the <UNK> life <UNK> br br four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there and if my <UNK> hadn't asked me to keep away from the house his girlfriend having just returned from a month long vacation i would have done the same and in my entire 25 years of movie going i have done that just once before
<START> spoiler alert my boyfriend some friends and i rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies we sort of knew what we were getting into but the lack of plot direction and special effects actually left us hoping for a great or passable fight scene between the two main characters the badly rendered swimming <UNK> and the super violent giant <UNK> that ate people like <UNK> ice cream we sort of get this in the end but had to be cut short due to possibly budget or time constraints its one redeeming quality is that its laughably bad with many <UNK> details pointed out by other readers i recommend this movie if your into cutting <UNK> to make yourself cry
<START> this weird movie from texas is about fallon a <UNK> rich boy in the late <UNK> although he looks like a 60s c w singer with <UNK> hair and <UNK> whose ship <UNK> on an island owned by count <UNK> de with his captain the count is afraid of pirates and <UNK> a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also <UNK> the captain meanwhile creepy former nurse <UNK> tells fallon the secrets of the castle the <UNK> has <UNK> and went mad fallon is trapped but brings supplies the captain is killed by a racist caricature slave fallon is thrown in the <UNK> with the <UNK> who always thinks it's her wedding day the <UNK> bride is horny <UNK> <UNK> kills her fallon and <UNK> escape the castle but the count and his slave chase them with dogs kills the slave and fallon kills fallon and <UNK> fall in love over the course of the next year but when the supply ship comes the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both <UNK> now they live for years in the castle <UNK> hair turns gray and <UNK> goes <UNK> fallon puts her in the <UNK> our tale of love and <UNK> ends br br so bizarre it's watchable and you can smell the drive in popcorn
<START> an interesting concept turned into carnage br br my first seeing feature from geoffrey wright <UNK> when i first took interest in it it seemed at the time an interesting concept br br <UNK> aussie film gothic setting melbourne <UNK> br br a very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name br br pros interesting concept br br cons waste of a good cast stuffed and stupid plot crooked camera angles not much variety of locations crap use of <UNK> <UNK> br br overall <UNK> worst attempt of a <UNK> film stick to <UNK> or <UNK> warning that film is dangerous
<START> i enjoyed <UNK> les <UNK> du <UNK> and was therefore expecting this film to be of a similar standard well the first 10 minutes were ok but then it <UNK> into a rather pretentious journey of a young man looking for the essence of life a sad disappointment
<START> i don't know which was worse the viewer's made <UNK> of or the stars in this movie who look like <UNK> am i to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed the child was a bit dark am i to believe her mother her father and her husband never once said hmmm this child looks a bit dark am i to believe when the <UNK> ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records that lisa <UNK> had this wow look on her face when she told her mother christopher is half black what was that for real gee do you think so so not only did the grandmother and grandfather look dopey and stupid never once mentioning this but i guess we were supposed to look surprised and say <UNK> <UNK> he is half black totally stupid movie almost an embarrassment even to watch this
<START> a group of cats look to find their way home after being kidnapped by a greedy butler br br the <UNK> is regarded as one of walt disney's finest <UNK> animations with its charming script and cool characters but it doesn't quite have the magic that created snow white or the jungle book br br the slow opening will have younger viewers raising their <UNK> but once the cats become established into the story does the fun and entertainment begin br br the young cats create the most enjoyment with a charming young hearted rivalry the special kind of bonding any brother or sister of any age can associate with br br not the funniest disney picture out there but there are some great comic moments especially involving the cats and the dogs the representation of the gangster cats is very impressive and equally amusing br br the story after the boring beginning is consistently entertaining and exactly what a family film should be there are hardly any <UNK> and no dull moments the journey to find home is interesting and you get a sense of exploring not to mention two very strange british <UNK> br br with disney you always get a strong meaningful message with the jungle book it is where you belong with beauty and the beast you explore the importance of inner beauty however with this 1970 picture there seems to be something missing the film has the importance and relevance of home but is not <UNK> enough it seems very far fetched and irrelevant br br my sister and i found it very strange watching this as some of the central characters were voiced by the jungle book cast br br despite the bad beginning and the confusion of its preaching message this is a consistently fun family film with a good music score and some cool crazy characters that viewers of any age can relate to
<START> the <UNK> 1 outta 5 stars br br pretty poor movie an old as the hills story about a high <UNK> gangster who wants to quit passing on his empire to his inept son of course it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit so a contract is put out on his life after throwing a big party an <UNK> jennifer jason leigh who i guess is never going to act in anything other than tv movies or low budget direct to video trash ever again is called to the scene our hero makes a pass at her offering her big money for a <UNK> she turns down his offer even though she needs the money but winds up staying overnight anyway even after being brutally <UNK> by the <UNK> son who thinks she was sent to kill his father ugh the story just goes on and on you can see every twist and turn coming a mile away weird soundtrack by some group called the tiger <UNK> will drive most people nuts but i thought there was one kind of cool track towards the end or maybe i was just excited because i could tell that the movie was almost over jennifer jennifer jennifer what the hell happened to you
<START> make sure you make this delightful comedy part of your holiday season if you admire dennis morgan or barbara stanwyck this film is a fun one to watch they really work well together as you would see in this movie the whole cast was very entertaining since i'm a dennis morgan fan this film was a real treat but everyone can enjoy it recommended
<START> pat o'brien had his best role ever as <UNK> dame football coach from humble <UNK> entered <UNK> dame as a student circa <UNK> he is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero br br upon <UNK> he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that <UNK> at him this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of <UNK> the game in a way too bad the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher certainly far better and <UNK> than the one i had in high school <UNK> hall in brooklyn to be exact br br he <UNK> his students he will not tolerate academic he is a coach for all seasons br br o'brien captures that common kind touch one of his students george is <UNK> played in a fine brief supporting performance by ronald reagan br br the years pass and the achievements run high but remains the same kind coach who <UNK> before <UNK> when football is called into question br br donald crisp is outstanding as a <UNK> dame priest who knew that was destined to coach football albert is adequate but his jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best was nominated that year in the supporting category for foreign <UNK> br br tragic death in a plane crash robbed the world of many more years of a totally <UNK> wonderful human being the film is great
<START> nbc should be ashamed i wouldn't allow my children to see this i definitely would tell my church to stay away this movie is proof as to why nbc has always been a 3rd rate network the producers actors and writers should get on their knees and beg god's forgiveness for making this work of fiction there were no pirates <UNK> wife didn't parade around on the deck of the <UNK> the <UNK> had no deck lot wasn't even born when this event took place did anyone attached to this project try reading the bible there were more than two animals of each type taken read the story in <UNK> how could anyone bring this to any screen small or large
<START> at first glance of this mini i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and <UNK> huston didn't return to the cast both john voight and barbara <UNK> did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western br br <UNK> jack jackson <UNK> played an excellent bad guy and louis <UNK> jr was as always true to form with his excellent acting skills br br the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes including one of the best where the <UNK> shoot out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film return to <UNK> <UNK> was to me almost up to the quality of the first of the series the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me and that marries <UNK> eye how the heck did that get in their that was a total <UNK> of characters the first 2 of the series made the epic story the next 2 in no way were of the same quality br br now if the first 2 could be <UNK> in <UNK> digital and an <UNK> presentation the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today
<START> i must say that i didn't expect much sitting down to watch pitch black but i got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun it's the type of flick where you can just lean back relax and have a great time just being entertained this isn't a deep film by any means everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as alien predator or such but when i watch a rip off i want it to be good and this rip off is great br br it opens with a galaxy of stars some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene 2001 star wars alien predator a ship is <UNK> through space when inside the entire <UNK> frozen crew is <UNK> the ship has been hit by something they crash land on a nasty little planet with three <UNK> everyone <UNK> out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has escaped <UNK> they <UNK> the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again they search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago br br then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a <UNK> <UNK> and the entire planet turns pitch black there also happen to be <UNK> of aliens that <UNK> in darkness living on the planet what are the chances they happen to be on the planet right as the <UNK> happens what are the chances and <UNK> has a rare talent he can see in the dark again what are the chances br br there seems to be a lot of in this movie but a film like this isn't out to get oscars for originality or believability it's there to entertain the audience it does so with ease <UNK> <UNK> is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever but i've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy homicidal <UNK> it is <UNK> listen to him <UNK> he did not know who he was fu ing with great stuff br br the aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks those from alien and <UNK> they've got long <UNK> heads like a hammerhead the quick moving <UNK> of the aliens and the stealth of a predator i assume david director and writer of the movie didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before at least i hope not br br aliens <UNK> might be a better name for this movie but then again it is better than both the second and third alien films put together in a time when apparently ended series are getting <UNK> terminator 3 alien 5 predator 3 alien vs predator pitch black stands out as a new series altogether two more sequels are planned let's just hope they don't get carried away i can just picture it twenty five years from now aliens vs predator vs pitch black aliens the fight of the year br br fight of the year title may be shared with the upcoming film freddy vs jason vs michael vs <UNK> vs norman bates vs alien vs predator vs terminator vs james cameron vs the dinosaur br br 4 5
<START> age cannot <UNK> the beauty of this east west love story for me ignoring the famous and lovely title song and its lyrics what we have is a <UNK> biography of two remarkable people caught in a moment of counter <UNK> involving social <UNK> <UNK> war doubt and the need for immense courage with hong kong as the backdrop this movie tells the story of a <UNK> doctor and a u s journalist who meet and fall in love during the korean war as mark elliott william <UNK> is intelligent <UNK> and a bit weak jennifer jones is perhaps well <UNK> perfect as dr han by turns doubt torn and <UNK> eager and <UNK> others in the large cast include <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> murray <UNK> virginia <UNK> richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> philip <UNK> <UNK> and donna <UNK> many of hollywood's best oriental actors played smaller uncredited parts also the script by john patrick followed <UNK> exquisite novel closely the direction by henry king was solid as always the thrust of the storyline is how unwilling han was to fall in love with elliott with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future and how <UNK> he was despite the <UNK> and <UNK> they faced as their affair became known the film is <UNK> physically busy interesting and often beautiful also the hill to which the lovers go to be apart the lovely bay where they swim are set against an already busy and crowded business city large social events and <UNK> streets hospital corridors and traffic filled <UNK> with cinematography by leon <UNK> ben makeup and helen <UNK> <UNK> the great work by set <UNK> sound and lighting art department and all concerned this has to be one of the most memorable productions set in a major non u s city of all time and one of the most difficult to capture on film yet what one remembers most here is the lovers thankfully not extremely young facing the odds against them and <UNK> exactly what they are then going ahead as if love <UNK> and those conditions which are set up as <UNK> to love do not the climax of the affair is <UNK> going back to war thereafter han receives his letters even after she knows he is has been killed they seem messages from a better <UNK> a world where hope is all that matters courage is the price of <UNK> to that world and it is always summer on a high and <UNK> hill set apart and above a zone where beauty and individual desires can be <UNK> made subject to ill fortune or <UNK> aside by <UNK> forces of evil truly love is a many thing dr han says and this movie stands as one of that shining <UNK> as a pearl timeless as a chinese <UNK> and lovely as polished <UNK> set against a rough background
<START> unlike bond and other detective movies alfred hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his <UNK> and courage and luck would get out of it jewel thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is <UNK> <UNK> tribute to the master of suspense the tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a great director himself br br it is the story of a common man <UNK> who one day realizes that he has a double called <UNK> who in fact is a jewel thief suddenly <UNK> finds himself in the middle of a <UNK> scheme and to save himself goes on a wild <UNK> chase to find this <UNK> who remains one step ahead of him the suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot <UNK> you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme just like hitchcock's movies jewel thief can <UNK> of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of br br everyone and i mean everyone <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kumar etc etc are in their top forms this is one of the best thrillers ever made in india
<START> i'm a bit <UNK> by some of these reviews <UNK> a k a not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person but they contain all kinds of <UNK> information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate br br afraid i'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its <UNK> <UNK> great idea shame about the execution and it was most <UNK> to watch so many good actors as well as some very bad ones including the <UNK> lead all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films br br i wish that a k a had been <UNK> innovative or just simply interesting sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations a missed opportunity
<START> <UNK> batman returns was tim <UNK> second round as director and yet again he scored a hit by making this film again dark and gloomy like his 1989 one <UNK> city again is a place of darkness and <UNK> with crime and corruption <UNK> out from every street corner it was also clever to see how burton used politics as a subplot that tied in well and neat with the business corruption of businessman max christopher walken and the plan to make the penguin danny <UNK> mayor of <UNK> anyway keaton again returns as batman bruce wayne and he gives another stellar performance as a strange and torn man who just can't find love in a normal world yet he is challenged when he meets another lonely soul in <UNK> kyle only ms kyle has a dark secret of her own one that's very <UNK> and she's just a downright <UNK> as the sexy and mysterious yet dangerous <UNK> michelle pfeiffer a plan forms between both villains to destroy <UNK> and most of all both want to rid themselves of the bat really this film even though violent and somewhat gross with many penguin scenes is clearly an exciting thrill ride from start to finish as you never find a dull moment and thumbs up to tim again for his exploring of the characters as dark and conflicted it just made the film even more interesting the performance from michelle pfeiffer was the best ever as no one could have played the <UNK> any better and <UNK> was perfect as the penguin his body frame fit the character just perfect his performance even though <UNK> was fun to watch batman returns is an entertaining thrill ride that you can't take your eyes off of as a viewer you will enjoy it many times it's that thrilling and explosive
<START> i'm a <UNK> davis fan for life because of this movie i've always loved samuel l jackson and the two make a great pair on screen this said i think is the best action movie i've ever seen forget the twist endings that audiences have now come to expect and that filmmakers now try mostly failing to <UNK> into their movies br br 10 10
<START> i really like salman <UNK> so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and <UNK> but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali her acting had a lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie thank you
<START> iron eagle has always been one of my films for a long time now it looks like but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view it's better than br br this film has some amazing <UNK> scenes when the fighter <UNK> are <UNK> through the air it also has the queen song one vision <UNK> in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic song br br to be honest iron eagle was very good but it's sequels were rubbish br br
<START> first of all i'd like to say that i really enjoyed this movie however that said i can't say that it was a good movie i went into the theatre with pretty low expectations something i've learned to do i'm glad i did because the plot and development wasn't stellar the jokes were low grade humor but i was in the right mindset to enjoy them br br i wasn't the only one in fact the entire theatre was laughing out loud i didn't hear anyone complain after the movie came to a close i even saw one guy fall out of his chair laughing but again i have to warn you <UNK> boy is not a top quality film it is a funny albeit low brow movie and if you go with the right mindset you'll really enjoy it oh and don't take kids to it
<START> it really is a great film after being able to ignore blake <UNK> pink <UNK> references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny julie is as usual wonderful singing and acting brilliantly i remember seeing it at the <UNK> cinema in the london on its release however <UNK> non appearance at the uk premiere of star was most unfortunate and apparently due to filming the <UNK> shots for darling <UNK> over ireland a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these <UNK> shots but she did not two box office <UNK> in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years but darling <UNK> just like star deserves much more public appreciation
<START> a ham actor without a penny who better than michael caine to play such a character he is totally and utterly hilarious but as in most of <UNK> performances he goes for it for real the film seems to be a showcase of dylan <UNK> and he's <UNK> in his double act with caine this however is where the script <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should have been <UNK> in a rather more <UNK> way they are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential <UNK> of the plot fly out of the window never mind get it if you can find it there is enough in it to make it a <UNK> journey
<START> nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring <UNK> scott thomas and harrison ford the cool <UNK> english beauty and the warm blooded american male what could possibly be more lovely well this is not that movie right away they ruin it by casting <UNK> scott thomas as an american <UNK> that's like casting hugh grant as babe ruth or colin <UNK> as al <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with <UNK> ex <UNK> in filthy <UNK> or <UNK> into <UNK> crowds and kissing babies she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an <UNK> senator the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives br br then there's harrison ford as a regular guy cop certainly he's tough enough for the role but the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow why couldn't he have been say a tough but wealthy <UNK> politician with blue collar roots who <UNK> late husband's <UNK> seat the two of them are initially quite cool to each other but for sake <UNK> is <UNK> to him and he in return starts showing her some of the <UNK> side of life things her husband <UNK> her from her political awakening <UNK> with the <UNK> passion of a newer more blue collar lover one who <UNK> her polish and <UNK> far more than her <UNK> husband now that's a love story instead of that though you get a blank meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens well there is one ghetto style drive by scene where harrison almost gets killed but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief br br the sky is always gray in this movie and our <UNK> lovely <UNK> always looks a little <UNK> when she's supposed to be dreaming of passion she looks more like she's dreaming of a <UNK> <UNK> and a cup of tea she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time like she'd really rather be <UNK> in the bed than <UNK> harrison ford br br all things considered i'd say you can't blame her
<START> the only reason i decided to view this film is because of the great acting talents of karen <UNK> <UNK> bad money <UNK> who is deeply involved with gary cole dave cry wolf <UNK> who is a great war hero and has all kinds of ways to make money and never seems to stop telling lies <UNK> and dave are trying to <UNK> an old home and <UNK> it to comfortable living conditions the relationship gets <UNK> and <UNK> decides to find out what is going on and the plot gets very mysterious if you are a big fan of karen this is the film for you i only wish karen would appear in more films i miss her great talents
<START> this must be the most boring film i ever saw the only positive i can say about it is that thankfully i didn't pay to see it we were given a free showing in school and everyone in the audience just sat there embarrassed wondering when the fun would start this piece of junk is a badly filmed way too long film the actual idea on why making the movie took about 10 seconds to present the only ones who can be interested in this film are those who lost their jobs and want to know why they might find some of the interviews interesting a different edit might have made an interesting documentary of this but i doubt it the interviews shown were not engaging in any way as it is it is just a tragedy both to behold and to be a part of avoid this film at any cost
<START> i can't help but forget that incredible scene in alien when the extra <UNK> burst out of one of the men's chest or even in predator when the invisible monster <UNK> upon the <UNK> soldiers and cut them to pieces both these movies expressed fascinating ideas on the run of the mill creature feature back track to the era of cheesy b movies and watch big men in phony suits <UNK> around killing people in small towns now recognize that the two movies above <UNK> this genre the cave does nothing to improve on it it tries nothing new and worst of all the cave doesn't even have good gore shame on them shame on them all br br <UNK> around in sexy <UNK> are the one dimensional characters of the cave all of which seem to not care when they witness the death of their colleagues they just <UNK> along <UNK> to the evil creature lurking in the darkness the plot is very easy to understand so you got the two brothers the black guy and the sexy female scientist the rest by the rest i mean all of those meet grisly <UNK> are even more <UNK> then the others we have the korean assistant the <UNK> <UNK> chick a russian scientist and two <UNK> both lacking a sense of emotion and are stupid enough to wander off by themselves this movie <UNK> to be extremely clichéd since everybody but the black guy one of the brothers and the female scientist meet an end it also seems only americans can survive the terror since the russian and the korean die don't be offended if i give away details there's no real surprise anyway br br to be straight forward they find this cave they go in the cave they get stuck in the cave they start dying in the cave one of them gets infected in the cave more die in the cave they get out of the cave only to discover that one of them has a <UNK> that will turn them into a ghastly monster which really doesn't seem to bother them that's the simplicity of the lackluster plot it doesn't even try to be original it even has the part where they decide their leader isn't capable and split up we have just seen this way to many times before br br i know in a movie like this people don't care about the performances but it's worth mentioning how bad they were everyone is just so dreary cole <UNK> was especially <UNK> and don't get me started on eddie who is frequently a lot better morris <UNK> is hands down the best thing in the movie his performance is actually decent he portrays the guy who <UNK> everybody down all the other actors are average at best in a show like this that's really not a bad thing br br now to the reason we go to this genre of film the action of course well to my regret the action was dull the death scenes are all boring hell the whole movie was there is barely any blood at all it's either they disappear and found later or they are attack and die without a <UNK> seeing the <UNK> man's death was the only exciting action i could find br br it's pretty amazing the bad things over shadow most of the things that are good a good example is to say the special effects were well done which they were the only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave it's going to be dark i found it extremely hard to <UNK> between the cave walls and the monsters so it was pretty hard to even see the creatures although i liked the special effects there was nothing original about the monsters they all <UNK> each other and they weren't frightening at all br br the cave marks the directorial debut for bruce hunt i don't see what he was trying to accomplish by making this film he obviously made a huge mistake almost everything about this movie <UNK> like a stink bomb a stink bomb is probably even more <UNK> than watching this mess again only the most <UNK> <UNK> will find this forgivable i gave up all hope in the middle of the film when i heard the phrase what the hell was that for the third time
<START> as you can tell from the few comments posted here mine may very well be the last you'll see unless there is a big dvd release or tcm plays it again this is a kind of our gang movie with a bunch of different kids mgm certainly was the musical studio if the musicians dancers and singers weren't under contract they were on tap was one of the most expensive that does it for a little charity work the <UNK> he received in that era was <UNK> of another musical film with jose iturbi mexican <UNK> featured about 100 kids playing some simple tune on 100 <UNK> so those <UNK> who think young children aren't musical are mistaken i was one br br as all write frankie smith good <UNK> american name gene reynolds was the bad but good kid who is taken in from the streets by the owners of a music school can you believe that walter brennan <UNK> <UNK> of all those western movies was the man running the school joel <UNK> peter mccarthy and <UNK> ann <UNK> were the bigger stars in they shall have music with a host of well known extras many of whom went on to become stars in their own rights as others have commented almost all of the kids in the orchestra actually the <UNK> from los angeles made big <UNK> of their lives either as musicians for the studios and other <UNK> br br sad to say there aren't that many young people's <UNK> today a sad mistake parents with children in school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water and many don't even know what is happening to the kids in school musical <UNK> can get to be <UNK> and almost everyone would rather had a football team br br this is the <UNK> concert by <UNK> you'll ever hear is contained in this movie in those days a quarter his playing is brilliant even if he looks like he'd rather be <UNK> else <UNK> by contract any concert by <UNK> <UNK> ma is so <UNK> it makes you want to run right out and buy a <UNK> this guy is having a good time like the kids in the street concert when they <UNK> to play at their school br br all of the <UNK> numbers were played by the kids and they make it sound easy i love this type of movie their plots are so simple it doesn't take you two days to figure out if you enjoyed or understood the movie at all we need some new movies like this can't do anything but inspire younger kids to play other <UNK> than <UNK> bravo

<START> when i voted my 1 for this film i noticed that 75 people voted the same out of <UNK> total votes that means that half the people that voted for this film feel it's truly terrible i saw this not long ago at a film festival and i was really <UNK> by it's poor execution the cinematography is unwatchable the sound is bad the story is cut and <UNK> from many other movies and the acting is dreadful this movie is basically a poor rip off of three other films no wonder this was never released in the usa
<START> some films just fade away but tourist trap has <UNK> the test of time and has <UNK> become a cult favorite though not completely original it owes much to the texas chainsaw massacre it holds its own with a sense of humor genuine creepy moments a brilliant score by <UNK> <UNK> and the fun performances by chuck <UNK> and the cast don't let the pg rating keep you away this film proves that gratuitous gore and nudity are not needed in every horror film to make it entertaining those elements are usually used to cover the lack of thrills in a film here the scares are <UNK> and effective plus only chuck <UNK> could carry a scene in which he has to share soup with a <UNK> a classic scene indeed now more accessible on dvd in widescreen this film is a must for fans of '70s horror fare
<START> when a killer calls is an unusually nasty slasher flick with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences the decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of when a stranger calls by pretty much putting in almost word for word the phone call sequences from that movie they seem very forced br br additionally the filmmaker commits the <UNK> but all too common sin of having the <UNK> friends being repulsive <UNK> so for the beginning of the film we really like and are rooting for the babysitter a nice believable job by but then she's joined by standard slasher flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined br br the flick sort of works but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected so be <UNK> warned
<START> i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it <UNK> jennifer lynch's name and seeing the 18 <UNK> i realised it might be disturbing in <UNK> i found the film a farce i found myself <UNK> in disbelief through parts of it the acting is atrocious bill <UNK> and his ridiculous <UNK> face i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction after some shocking incident there is plenty to try and shock the viewer in this film 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather everything was <UNK> or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film quiet and intense i really could not recommend this film to anyone its violent without point ridiculous characters bad acting bad script and plain silly
<START> true stories make the best stories don't they there's always something enjoyable about a story be it novel or movie or whatever simply by the fact that it's real makes the story all the more fascinating this movie is based on a true story of two young american men one a government employee and <UNK> <UNK> timothy <UNK> <UNK> the lee sean penn a drug dealer these two begin selling government mostly cia secrets in 1975 to the soviet union br br the film focuses on the human aspect of the two men as well as their growing personal problems especially <UNK> character with ever drug <UNK> rather than <UNK> their status as <UNK> to america which would no doubt hurt the film's credibility in the us <UNK> gradually becomes more <UNK> and eventually frustrated and paranoid as their <UNK> drag on and they dig ever deeper into <UNK> territory becomes more <UNK> and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and more desperate to maintain control over a situation he has no control top of which he already has problems with the law the torment of <UNK> and families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds well to the idea that espionage against one's country even if thought to be done <UNK> leads only to major problems and the <UNK> of the <UNK> of the friendship and trust between the two main characters br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br <UNK> and penn each did extensive research on the characters to capture their individual look and feel so they're portrayed with extensive depth and realism br br the acting is excellent br br the atmosphere of paranoia builds quite well br br the story is fascinating and of course as one based on actual events it has some added kick br br nice sets br br the <UNK> working with the <UNK> and are portrayed very well and not stereotyped or given evil just for the sake of making them look bad br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br the music is alright nothing perfect though br br sound effects are occasionally a little was the case with a lot of films from the seventies through the eighties br br the bad br br chris <UNK> timothy <UNK> has a relationship with a woman that we hardly know because of trouble <UNK> with the us and soviet <UNK> her life can be put in this isn't as expanded upon as it feels it should've been minor problem though br br the ugly br br the apparent simplicity required to sell government secrets is a little unnerving nothing like a constant state of to keep the masses feeling as <UNK> as possible br br memorable scene br br seeing the first cia report accidentally sent to the wrong place with the reason being rough night br br this was another film that suffered massive <UNK> due to the controversial content of the story studios and producers didn't see how a movie about two american <UNK> could ever be accepted by american audiences luckily it's filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality of course it helps that the <UNK> anti heroes aren't portrayed like a couple young men who've made gross errors in judgment in their lives as such it becomes a very human drama and one portrayed very well and very <UNK> br br acting 9 10 story 10 10 atmosphere 8 10 cinematography 8 10 character development 9 10 special effects make up 8 10 little <UNK> high quality nudity sexuality 2 10 one scene in a strip club violence gore 7 10 no gore just some violence music 7 10 direction 9 10 br br cheesiness 0 10 <UNK> 0 10 br br overall 8 10 br br if you like films about espionage and spies then you can't go wrong here if you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters then this may also work for you highly recommended br br www <UNK> com
<START> having seen rush live i'm able to appreciate the <UNK> of this others may complain of sound problems but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60 000 <UNK> and it goes to show the <UNK> <UNK> gain of attention
<START> this is a god awful norris film with one of the most annoying performances ever in <UNK> levels and a weak script the characters were terrible and it has hardly any action plus even chuck norris stinks in this christopher is very weak as the main villain and the story was not very interesting plus norris seemed bored with the whole thing and i don't blame him as i was too <UNK> levels gives one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever i couldn't stand as i was tempted to rip the tape out of my vcr plus norris and levels had no chemistry together if your looking for some great martial art moves from norris don't go near this however if you want a movie with an uninteresting story hardly any action and bad acting look further this is a god awful norris film with one of the most annoying performances ever from <UNK> levels avoid it like the plague the direction is incredibly bad aaron norris does an incredibly bad job here with no suspense or thrills bland camera work and keeping the film at a dull pace there is a little bit of blood and violence we get 2 gory ripped out heart exploding body and a few <UNK> wounds the acting is really bad chuck norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here his one liners are flat and his acting wasn't that great and i am a huge norris fan this is his absolute worst norris still rules <UNK> levels is incredibly annoying here his whiny <UNK> performance severely <UNK> me i was so hoping for him to get it good but sadly he didn't christopher is pretty weak as the main villain his voice was cool but he over acted big time j wilson is beautiful and did okay with what she had to do rest of the cast are terrible overall please avoid this it's not worth the torture even if you are a huge norris fan like me bomb out of 5
<START> i'm not a movie maker but i do know it is hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw your audience into the character horses on mars does this and more when you are watching a good movie you don't want it to end this is how i felt watching this film it is visually <UNK> and the takes on such human qualities that you feel you are on the journey with him br br really looking forward to see what exciting adventures mr anderson takes us on in the future well done
<START> fans of apocalyptic movies will <UNK> this well made low budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 george pal classic when worlds <UNK> a <UNK> is headed for a near <UNK> with earth and when his fellow scientists disregard his <UNK> of doom eccentric scientist peter crawford dennis hopper <UNK> a group of private <UNK> to secretly <UNK> an underground <UNK> br br the story unfolds through the eyes of muscle bound <UNK> war veteran jake lowe peter <UNK> who inadvertently discovers <UNK> hidden <UNK> and then decides that crawford is wrong for keeping his project hidden from the rest of humanity as the <UNK> approaches the subject of who should live and who should die makes for interesting drama br br while the special effects are not in the same league i enjoyed the story more than i did spielberg's war of the worlds because i feel this screenplay is better some suspension of scientific reality is required but it's worthwhile for the development of a good story i highly recommend this film to fans of the genre
<START> if it is true that <UNK> is a two sided <UNK> which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its <UNK> then the cinematic portrait of erika <UNK> has its reality professor <UNK> treats her piano students with a kind of fascist <UNK> while longing for the same for herself her <UNK> expression projects her desire that is why she can hurt without guilt or <UNK> br br along comes talented charming handsome young walter benoit who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity he wants to become her student so as to be close to her she rejects him out of hand but because of his talent the vienna <UNK> votes him in he falls in love with her again she pushes him away but he will not take no for an answer and thereby begins his own descent into <UNK> and loss of self respect br br the question the viewer might ask at this point is who is in control the <UNK> or the <UNK> indeed who is the <UNK> and who the <UNK> it is hard to tell is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque <UNK> and <UNK> or is it the person who is <UNK> out the door <UNK> giving the order that no one is to know what happened br br but erika is not just a <UNK> freak she is a sex extreme freak she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the <UNK> of <UNK> actually that isn't even true she says she doesn't care what others think she doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love love she calls it for her sex and love are one and the same br br at one point walter tells her that love isn't everything how ironic such a is to her how gratuitous the comment br br the movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael <UNK> who <UNK> the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but <UNK> as in the bathroom when walter <UNK> himself high above the top of the <UNK> to find erika within he also employs a fine <UNK> of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another this is particularly important in the scene in which erika like a blood <UNK> corpse caught in stark white and black light lies under her lover rigid as stone here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its <UNK> <UNK> we don't need to see any more br br the part of erika <UNK> is perfect for isabelle <UNK> who is not afraid of extremes indeed she excels in them i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul like the woman she plays in this movie she is <UNK> of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a <UNK> sense what matters to her is the performance and the challenge no part is too demanding no character too <UNK> it's as if <UNK> wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to watch her as she does she is always fascinating and nearly flawless she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work br br i think it is highly <UNK> and <UNK> us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the la from 1977 when she was 22 years old there she was apple sweet in her red hair and <UNK> and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing a <UNK> apprentice <UNK> her character was shy about sex and modest just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a <UNK> here she is a self destructive witch bitter with hateful knowledge of herself shameless and entirely <UNK> br br <UNK> is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of <UNK> hollywood could never make a movie like this in the american cinema only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty <UNK> greatly <UNK> her exposure because of her ability and range but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in la 1995 in which she plays a vile <UNK> <UNK> br br do see this for isabelle <UNK> you won't forget her or the character she brings to life
<START> this movie is a piece of the time in which it was made realistic movies were not candy <UNK> during the late 60s and early 70s the producers did not try to create some happy ending that didn't exist the lack of a happy ending would create <UNK> in the audience that hopefully would <UNK> them on to action at least that's how it seemed at the time in today's movie world this movie would probably not be done there would definitely not be this ending however realistic the sad fact is that the movie depicted a situation which could not be improved upon without action from the improvement of the relationship between the white southern traditional thinking and the <UNK> movements of that time
<START> <UNK> doll of flesh by is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse torture and <UNK> a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions typically twisted japanese porno <UNK> that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore there is no plot to speak of just plenty of hard core sex scenes <UNK> <UNK> again and lots of blood the special effects are quite impressive the <UNK> of japanese porn actress is shown in <UNK> detail the tongue cutting scene really made me <UNK> her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is <UNK> <UNK> open and finally one of the <UNK> is having sex with her intestines psycho the snuff <UNK> actually reminds me guinea pig flowers of flesh and blood but it's not as memorable so if you're a fan of ultra <UNK> japanese <UNK> like all women are <UNK> or <UNK> my virgin slave give this one a look 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of those movies you find when you stay up too late and only have basic cable it's hard to believe this movie was made in <UNK> considering it looks like something out of the late 80s <UNK> youngsters with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who's on a mission to make the best flavor ever soylent cream br br this movie is extremely demented and is only scary in how creepy and absolutely ridiculously gross it is actually the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home the fact that these kids have no escape from their silent suburban <UNK> makes any random loony loose in the neighborhood seem like a walk in the park br br the most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical fat kid is so obviously a slim pre teen with a mountain of padding under his <UNK> i guess that either a they hadn't invented couldn't afford a fat suit b the casting director was too lazy to find a <UNK> child star or c we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is starving and has an enormously <UNK> belly br br so if you're up at 2 am and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip on with your <UNK> friends go ahead and take a look personally i'd rather be sleeping
<START> in the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations blade is by far one of the best realised and most faithful overall to the source material given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in <UNK> tomb of dracula the writer took almost all of the characters and plot elements from the <UNK> history while changes were inevitably made the <UNK> points of the film right over any criticisms don't let any of you friends tell you different blade is one fine film if it feels too comic for you stanley kubrick <UNK> out there it's because it's supposed to deal with it but don't <UNK> it for it
<START> space is a <UNK> right therefore space sucks vampires also suck a really bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the sucking power right br br it started with what could have been a fun premise retelling <UNK> <UNK> dracula story in the future there's a salvage crew that's sent out to investigate a <UNK> ship that's lost in space called the fans of the original novel will <UNK> assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of dracula set in the future unfortunately short of sharing character names this one takes the <UNK> route and goes into the b movie galaxy twenty minutes later when <UNK> becomes a vampire trust me when i tell you he's the best actor in the movie and that's not saying much br br casper van <UNK> should be his <UNK> on daytime television erika <UNK> should have quit after she left <UNK> and poor <UNK> <UNK> is having trouble reading from the cue cards the guy who plays dracula in this one is more ridiculous than frank <UNK> was in the 1970's version if you can manage to sit through the whole movie you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable the ending makes one wonder if the actors and the crew realized what a piece of garbage they were making and walked off the set br br take <UNK> vampire fans this one sucks twice as hard
<START> not a good one not at all br br this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the <UNK> home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of <UNK> itself br br it's basically nothing my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast cash to buy a boat or something because this one's just ridiculous thankfully it doesn't kill or ruin the series but it just has no effect on the series at all br br i'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly <UNK> to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than the <UNK> curse
<START> this is the worst kind of film br br the plot is ludicrous the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child <UNK> in their <UNK> good boys and need to be <UNK> that this might be grounds for <UNK> are black people universally inspiring do the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody <UNK> do judges really think that a fair trial can be <UNK> when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting kill him do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the <UNK> waiting to hear the verdict do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing do <UNK> really <UNK> people of murder because they feel sorry for them do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to <UNK> people that their client was <UNK> insane br br worst of all any high minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to <UNK> the audience was the subject of rape let alone child gang rape really in competent hands here is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands and if so why the completely gratuitous kidnap and <UNK> of sandra <UNK> and the completely pointless <UNK> rape charge against one of the witnesses seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all br br this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a <UNK> and making a crass shallow tasteless money <UNK> from it shame on them
<START> this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain top <UNK> as free men in <UNK> century brazil the story is interesting and <UNK> however this film as a film is terrible br br the soundtrack is not period music or <UNK> music it is <UNK> brazilian pop music from the early 1980s battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop <UNK> best left to the disco or bad cops dramas admittedly the lyrics are folk ish tales of the <UNK> the special effects are absurd rather than <UNK> the <UNK> of african religion and <UNK> beliefs they merely make the film look cheap they are completely unbelievable and i don't mean merely in a sense of <UNK> br br life within the <UNK> of could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film for this society as shown in the film is one part <UNK> one part <UNK> pop festival moreover it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and <UNK> around to the <UNK> of '80s pop music on the other hand they have an abundance of beautiful food but the viewer hardly sees any work being done the king against private property in a hackneyed and clichéd way when a man complains that people are taking the <UNK> that he has grown over many months the king says what comes from the earth belongs to everyone as the earth belongs to no one if they need food they have a right to take yours br br i am glad that i learned about this episode in history but i am <UNK> that a film with such low production values and that <UNK> upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today
<START> regarded as another one of the recent over the top <UNK> brought upon us by hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failed especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of natalie portman this film is almost <UNK> driven by the chemistry that both susan and natalie share they seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family they go through so many mother daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities i feel that these two <UNK> talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of <UNK> and really saved the suffering plot i would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over the top <UNK>
<START> absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen it totally ignores and <UNK> any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull thank god the 80's are over and god save whatever man was actually born as james bond iii
<START> in my work with the only <UNK> non profit organization security on campus inc dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime <UNK> and student awareness i see all too often the type of campus violence and cover <UNK> through secret campus <UNK> portrayed in the movie <UNK> mary ' in fact we receive numerous calls and <UNK> for information every month from campus <UNK> such as <UNK> who are facing similar situations br br its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent <UNK> by mary ' the <UNK> roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by melissa joan hart for justice was very well done and accurately <UNK> br br this was the first television movie that i have ever seen that i felt truly reflected and <UNK> all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our <UNK> college and university <UNK> although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours this movie comes closer than any others i've seen
<START> michael hypnotic <UNK> is a film that will stay in one's memory for quite a long time this <UNK> crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films the movie is <UNK> photographed by m david <UNK> with a haunting score by stuart br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you should stop reading here br br the idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers never has the <UNK> views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in <UNK> we don't need any color the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the <UNK> in this remote <UNK> br br at the center of the story is irwin the sick child under the care of the mysterious father <UNK> this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is <UNK> the medicine for his body but is he really there at all we watch him <UNK> with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery there are two <UNK> open graves will one of them be for irwin br br at the same time another plot line plays parallel to this first theme we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created their reward is one <UNK> and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of people br br the third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower <UNK> cup of tea <UNK> and happy they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area when irwin meets them at the cemetery he offers to help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here we watch as the <UNK> examine the <UNK> the boy has placed among the pages of his bible could irwin be that angel br br the closing sequence show us all parties leaving <UNK> in different directions the men in black riding their <UNK> perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired <UNK> given to them as a reward the mystical group is seen <UNK> a plane and taking off for a higher place we also realize that the child in father <UNK> in spite of the and the care he received from the <UNK> figure has died br br michael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals nick nolte as father <UNK> turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man james woods as walter one of the men working for the <UNK> does a fine job the biggest surprise is duel farmer who makes an excellent impression as irwin this child actor with the right <UNK> shows great promise br br the mystical group is brilliantly acted by <UNK> hannah robin <UNK> ben foster and anthony <UNK> the man with the funny <UNK> peter <UNK> mark polish ben foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr polish direction br br the beauty of the film relies in its simplicity mr vision will haunt one's memory the images of montana as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while
<START> a fairly enjoyable kidnapping caper set in new orleans but its main downfall in my opinion is that it packs way too much political intrigue and double crossing and not enough of the sexy young actors scenes of vibrant colour original <UNK> style and biting humour these aspects combine to give <UNK> daring cinema which makes a whole bunch of recent stuff look <UNK> dull let's hope continues with such flair he looks like a talent to watch out for the <UNK> bunch of small time crooks in the film are by the <UNK> <UNK> of emma thompson and alan <UNK> the humour of whose scenes is much needed in making the movie what it is the pair pull off their obligatory southern just as well as the <UNK> and it's a delight to hear these two <UNK> of british cinema <UNK> away to each other with lethal weapon style <UNK> just a pity that the only scenes they have the opportunity to steal are exclusively theirs anyway with a bit less politics and <UNK> the film would be near perfect so i'll give it a healthy 8 10 and hope that a few people remember it a bit better than the box office did
<START> i loved this movie when i was a teenager loved it it hasn't grown up with me though maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish full of macho <UNK> cheesy dialogue overwrought <UNK> mo and characters saying a lot the <UNK> narrative <UNK> <UNK> from one character to another one plot <UNK> to another without ever bringing it all together and it doesn't help that william <UNK> <UNK> expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching but no one's really at the top of their game here and the women folk get particularly short <UNK> the only real impact comes from the impressive <UNK> sequences and hans <UNK> <UNK> score which remains one of my all time favourites
<START> as a native chinese i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a <UNK> i said <UNK> because it is a lie that chinese people have been <UNK> for thousand years br br i guess most western audience may don't know means the first emperor the king in this film is the most notorious <UNK> in ancient china the chinese word was spoken by the king means 'the land and the <UNK> spoken from his mouth is totally lie from then on one after another all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said br br another fact is empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people br br well i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a <UNK>
<START> in a year when <UNK> in the rain and high <UNK> were released this <UNK> turkey somehow won the oscar for best picture half the film is nothing more than circus performances the other half is soap opera and melodrama heston and <UNK> both <UNK> although they are models of restraint compared to the annoying <UNK> playing a self centered <UNK> artist <UNK> acts like an <UNK> high school student in a badly produced school play <UNK> is the only cast member to turn in a decent performance demille has no interest in telling a good story only in creating an overlong spectacle not matter how dull
<START> i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of <UNK> <UNK> i was searching for new material to watch since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn't interest me i've always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael <UNK> so i chose this movie i was pleasantly surprised br br personally i enjoyed the film rich who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box are well justified i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page br br i like suspense movies and this one was no exception the movie kept me guessing until the very end i was surprised by the ending br br the moments of reflection and <UNK> of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense his reactions to those gave the film a sense of the <UNK> yet side of police work the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition br br if you like suspense films but also like films that <UNK> on the character's feeling personal <UNK> side this film is for you br br should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite guide watch it br br however if you are looking for a rental video follow rich advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it
<START> remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on friday and saturday late nights when our <UNK> thought we were in charge well this movie plays exactly like one of those movies <UNK> biggest claim to fame was the love interest to mel <UNK> character in lethal weapon 2 and this performance was one of the reasons why she's never made it big she's a terrible actress br br in lethal weapon 2 i thought she was cute cute enough to check out some of the other movies she'd been in including loves music loves to dance another big let down which i obviously was not impressed with either but as attractive as she is to my eyes my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap predictable role and done it very badly br br in this movie <UNK> stars as a <UNK> and not a good one either who's working the <UNK> of france couldn't cut it in her own <UNK> so she's making their ears bleed who's down on her luck but even worse the french government wants to throw her out because of an <UNK> <UNK> or maybe they just caught her act but she gets married to this <UNK> who is just as down on his luck and the predictability begins terribly is there any way to give this movie a negative rating 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it
<START> the priest into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love but the process of love and salvation has high beauty of human or vampire http <UNK> co <UNK> diary br br and the love of femme fatale is not notorious but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire she did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost but decided to leave human alone fragile but lovely femme fatale this movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire that far beyond priest and salvation also i thought about love adam was not so responsible for <UNK> but this adam priest <UNK> and responsible to pick eve up from the paradise lost <UNK> world another <UNK> poem of adam eve paradise lost
<START> i'm <UNK> to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of <UNK> last year at <UNK> comes to mind well x ain't no last year at <UNK> i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years x achieved <UNK> in that august group in my defense i believe i made a <UNK> effort to stand my ground hoping things would turn around however i finally threw in the <UNK> just shy of the 90 minute mark quite respectable under the circumstances x does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of <UNK> earlier work after a 10 year <UNK> that must have been bitter for him indeed <UNK> is still spinning in his grave
<START> br br is simply david <UNK> best movie all the people compare it to the matrix they're not even similar if you enjoyed <UNK> other works just a little bit you'll love this one
<START> if you like bad movies and you must to watch this one here's a good one not quite as funny as the first but much lower quality a must see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for a good laugh at the writing
<START> if you came here it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it br br i feel for you i really do and i <UNK> apologize as a canadian because that's what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the bleeding reported out of every dozen cases br br i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their thanks for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the bottom right hand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie br br and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my <UNK> trailer i swear to god br br you know what i'm not writing anymore about this it's just too painful
<START> i adore this film the chemistry between the two leads miller and <UNK> is amazing they spark so well off of each other creating an unlikely comedy duo alan <UNK> is hilarious his enthusiasm for the role is clearly evident as he camps it up the acting is superb and it is a genuinely amusing and touching film not the greatest film ever made i'll admit but it is a huge amount of fun and i would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty brit flicks includes some of the best british actors including michael so you can't go far wrong look out for cameos from david <UNK> and matt lucas of little britain and rock profile fame
<START> <UNK> devil is <UNK> the first major studio full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process supposedly producer went to africa to shoot a different movie but after hearing the tale of two man eating lions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decided on this one it's a good story too almost <UNK> like fear redemption the great white hunter and all it's the telling of the story that seems to drag almost as though filming in the new process was too <UNK> for the crew the action scenes are stiff almost too staged but these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion
<START> whenever <UNK> miyazaki does the <UNK> writes directs and <UNK> a movie he makes a classic film for the ages he has done it again with no no br br the story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight <UNK> along with her younger sisters by her father a bitter ex human wizard named <UNK> the fish escapes from her father and rides a <UNK> to shore where she is caught up in a operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle this underwater sequence must be one of the most <UNK> drawn animated scenes ever <UNK> and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release miyazaki who shows no fear of having a busy scene has <UNK> himself there were literally hundreds of <UNK> drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time br br when the fish escapes the operation while still trapped in the bottle a five year old boy named spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle saving her since she is the result of her father's magic she is capable of magic herself and her father <UNK> tries to retrieve her the boy names the fish just when learns that can speak her father successfully <UNK> her back into <UNK> br br after a war of <UNK> with her father manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human she meets up again with in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways there is a <UNK> factor in this film <UNK> and arguably <UNK> that of no <UNK> joe <UNK> once again provided outstanding musical support br br the story itself is simple as are miyazaki's films in general and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers while i haven't viewed it enough to be sure the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep <UNK> in long discussions as <UNK> to <UNK> no did nonetheless this is the ultimate feel good entertainment movie i gave the movie a ten out of ten rating
<START> was <UNK> <UNK> film and the first in which her <UNK> swedish voice was heard she plays the lead character anna who has <UNK> with being abandoned by her father chris a drunken <UNK> owner played by george f marion and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water br br meeting irish matt charles <UNK> may mark the turning point for her or does it garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later marie <UNK> makes an impact in the role which gave her a second <UNK> of movie success in films such as min and bill dinner at eight and emma while marion and <UNK> are more than adequate br br an interesting slice of movie history garbo would do better <UNK> in the years following but will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen
<START> not only have i read the book and watched the movie but i was <UNK> on the <UNK> john f kennedy when they filmed this needless to say film <UNK> and actors can be trying to people trying to do their jobs now about the movie as a career navy man i was pretty upset on how they showed life on board an aircraft <UNK> i could pick apart the inaccuracies throughout the movie anyone that has lived on a <UNK> could but that would take pages one scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the <UNK> combat information center and they were watching a radar contact move across the screen each time the contact moved it <UNK> unfortunately that equipment doesn't <UNK> like that i was a <UNK> on that equipment the book was based upon fact the movie wasn't the follow on tv series was just as bad and the navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad if you're a navy person watch this to see how a movie about <UNK> life is seen from the eyes of hollywood if your not a navy person watch <UNK> or top gun at least those movies are entertaining and based upon fact
<START> sings david in this movie but it is it's all about america so don't be ashamed to watch it just think if you can to prevent more damage you know you're just the same regular guy next door so be careful one of the best critics of common mind and friendship still don't care go for it for the music it's worth a try just close your eyes and pat and david <UNK> will touch you so deep you'll start to scream and while watching if you'll dare to open your eyes please don't do the popcorn stuff you're gonna miss quite a lot you may think that it's not worth but think twice and don't look at your <UNK> lawn you never know what to find there is it worth try it just don't die or over it
<START> <UNK> cheesy <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> from the la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in los angeles even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog nonsensical plot <UNK> and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen br br i have a theory every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his her career this was tommy lee <UNK> turn although he makes a decent effort the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames <UNK> sorry about that most of the supporting cast is also <UNK> by the hackneyed writing a few of the actors simply phone in their roles anne <UNK> deserves special hall of shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist she is about as convincing in this role as pee wee herman and even he would have at least done a better acting job br br since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here i would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends and have a game of find the scientific <UNK> the loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like everybody looks the same over and over here's a <UNK> of the kind of nonsense you can expect a scheme to blow up a building is <UNK> <UNK> and the dynamite set and <UNK> all within a space of about 20 minutes br br let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clichés divorced <UNK> scientists who get ignored by everybody obnoxious cops tough street kids <UNK> teenagers greedy <UNK> etc all are present and in abundance the film also <UNK> you over the head with a relentless <UNK> of political correctness br br for fans of cheese and silliness only all other viewers beware
<START> the questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary the <UNK> beauty and horror of one mans walk through life are revealed in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are combined and connected through a mental <UNK> that has been transformed into a single straight <UNK> which the walls have been <UNK> with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the <UNK> of his own vocal <UNK> this film for about 80 minutes have discovered a new dimension of storytelling what do i call this apparently new sense only god knows after all isn't a miracle something that god does for us but chooses to remain anonymous br br this is a <UNK> to see if you like to experience the lovely horror of war this documentary will <UNK> your soul to the <UNK>
<START> it's a shame that <UNK> and his buddy do not get the world wide recognition that other cartoon comic characters get br br this is another funny <UNK> cartoon <UNK> with entertainment the animation is excellent and the voice characterization good even if the <UNK> is a little out the music and score fit well within the story and the in of some modern musical numbers is a nice touch br br the running time seems short and while it's not the best <UNK> story or the most developed cartoon it's good clean fun the modern disney like animation will capture children <UNK> fans and new <UNK> enjoy the adventure
<START> this movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days kind of like plan 9 from outer space in spite of this it's still a classic <UNK> among my favorite creature features possible spoilers ahead count dracula and larry <UNK> aka <UNK> arrive at the laboratory of dr <UNK> seeking a cure for their <UNK> anti social behavior such as killing people in the meantime kindly dr <UNK> discovers the body of the frankenstein monster becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life a common character <UNK> among scientists mad or otherwise he goes against his better judgement resulting in monster mayhem and madness one of the final universal classics of it's time <UNK> and <UNK> meet frankenstein followed 3 years later it rates a 10 with this reviewer <UNK> steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of dracula and becoming a half werewolf vampire creature coming to a tragic end at 1 hour 7 min it packs quite a punch a worthy addition to my video collection br br rating out of
<START> i would have to say that in general <UNK> movies have impressed me i have a 5 year old <UNK> fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say i have seen quite a lot of <UNK> these holidays but i am not sick of them br br this film visually has a lot to offer especially the backgrounds and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie one thing i noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of hair in this film it has a lovely range of <UNK> from classical music and i think that this is great as it exposes a new generation to the classics this film is well worth ago especially if you have young they will be entertained for hours
<START> this film really misses the mark on most <UNK> the accents are laughably weak the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best br br they've got a great idea it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above br br the writer seems to think by putting the word f <UNK> into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard he's no brick top thats for sure br br next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film br br it's a crime to compare this to films like the business lock stock and snatch
<START> if you have ever <UNK> at wal mart then you probably know about the 5 dvd bin that sits by the <UNK> department well that is where i found this movie however i was tricked you see the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy <UNK> on it and even listed her name as a <UNK> i picked it up thinking wow i didn't know sandra <UNK> did this movie so i was <UNK> to go home and watch a cool sandra <UNK> movie much to my surprise ms <UNK> had a small role very small role she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent talk about supporting actress she may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie besides being <UNK> of this being a <UNK> flick i looked past that and i continued to watch an action packed film negative at one point for special effects a gun was taped to the camera you gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is
<START> <UNK> master of the thieves br br watch some movie steal some parts of them write a script it must be very easy to be a director in turkey i think <UNK> watched identity 2003 saw 2004 a few series which is about crime murder etc then he said <UNK> <UNK> i have found it after that he wrote the script of the movie br br you can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie it took only 10 minutes for me he <UNK> i'm the murderer i'm the murderer there is no mystery br br <UNK> <UNK> is same <UNK> exaggerated <UNK> funny macho man br br there is only one good thing in the movie the performance of is very good you may see the movie just for that
<START> the vampire <UNK> has in my opinion actually proved its <UNK> of such infamous there were many sub genre films last year from a <UNK> of countries i've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss forgive my <UNK> but since i've recognized the trend as a phenomenon which it is and <UNK> features my favorite horror <UNK> i'm going to now move outside of north america for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn't see as of now br br of the many effects of twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies i hate this sexist which has the effect of <UNK> an entire generation of fans into sides i think men are prone to hate <UNK> work and its <UNK> to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an <UNK> which was always theirs is now <UNK> women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral <UNK> since they grew up with <UNK> expectations that were <UNK> four times we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying <UNK> if vampires are going to survive the <UNK> and remain relevant cue <UNK> this korean film was directed by park chan <UNK> of <UNK> fame there are two ways to <UNK> it either it between gender expectations and is universally <UNK> enjoyable or it is a <UNK> mess that doesn't decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one don't let me convince you that the film has no <UNK> its director is a man whose fame is story driven action films its protagonist is male and has a passive aggressive interest in his lover more on this later still his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived and his attention is returned there is a male <UNK> to this picture yet it is not so one sided that women could not enjoy it the same cannot be said of or new moon br br the plot follows an <UNK> <UNK> novel called which i have not read according to <UNK> the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man he kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her the two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man's body between them they are thus driven to insanity but care for the woman's <UNK> mother at the <UNK> conclusion they try to kill each other discover each other's plans and commit suicide br br now this nearly 150 year old french novel into modern south korea and you've got <UNK> chan <UNK> doesn't <UNK> the story enough to elevate this to must see he often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration i think the most memorable parts are when his <UNK> are unhinged by narrative his use of the mother in law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect see it br br the protagonist is originally a <UNK> christian who becomes a vampire after a <UNK> blood <UNK> following his <UNK> for a new medicine he thus becomes the god he once was smitten with people flock to him and view him as a grand <UNK> ok that's really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he <UNK> it instead of confronting the <UNK> people he instead blood out of <UNK> hospital patients br br let's continue with the christian <UNK> the woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband her <UNK> mother in law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter in <UNK> <UNK> finger the man kills her but <UNK> her the two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly <UNK> the humans the man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him they both die but he for her crimes and his own but the film portrays her evil more <UNK> br br the woman character is a caricature and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior she is a housewife with no education while the man is a priest whose mortal life was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their characteristics she becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge he becomes a <UNK> with a spirit his life is how <UNK> view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine <UNK>
<START> the third entry in the <UNK> franchise but apparently the three made for tv obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with nicole kidman are <UNK> known and very popular i haven't seen either the early 80's revenge of the <UNK> wives or the mid 90's the <UNK> husbands but this the <UNK> children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film it's basically the exact same film as the original obviously less mysterious yet much <UNK> and incredibly 80's to the <UNK> degree the main difference here like the title implies is that not just the <UNK> wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage <UNK> in town <UNK> the typical and highly effective <UNK> treatment <UNK> by the local men's association for some reason the scenario attempts to <UNK> the <UNK> mystery until late in the film even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement the <UNK> family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of new york to the small and peaceful community of <UNK> particularly father steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in <UNK> and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife whom his new wife laura and adolescent children mary and david know very little about died under mysterious circumstances the town is almost too perfect with <UNK> neighbors and model students and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to <UNK> their efforts to <UNK> the place and take the local youth of <UNK> in <UNK> cause <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> particularly the members of the men's association and put the <UNK> relationships under a lot of stress david meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school lois but when even she transforms into a domestic <UNK> overnight david can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister <UNK> secret the first hour of the <UNK> children is slow paced and rather tame but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the vhs cover promises and like a late 80's thriller ought to be in fact the <UNK> <UNK> behind the <UNK> secrets is illustrated in greater detail and i think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that at least i did the overall plot still doesn't make a lot of sense and the script is chock full of irrational aspects but it's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear the acting performances are far above average especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the men's association depict plausible characters and even teenage players <UNK> lauren and randall give away impressive performances recommended without <UNK>
<START> this is a teen movie and while u watch it expect some nonsensical stuff added here and there but overall the movie is effective very effective it makes you question and leaves you thinking the story is kinda far fetched but is believable and makes you feel good in sequences its not like its the usual done and tried path the characters are pretty well defined and are convincing justin long stands out among all the others and watch out for his speech in the end he will convince anyone with that speech he is simply brilliant in that speech he needs to take on some more serious roles he is worth more than just teen movies <UNK> this movie and get <UNK>
<START> what a cast and what a waste of it seriously when a movie has gabriel <UNK> jamie foxx <UNK> <UNK> stuart <UNK> hal <UNK> <UNK> griffith and <UNK> stallone in it you would expect some quality the movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it yeah i think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it br br the story is not only messy and unlikely it also isn't exactly terribly original it uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies but to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it it made the story such an unlikely one to watch on top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best <UNK> in the game this is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn't ever made a lot of sense to me br br despite that the movie has a great cast it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles i don't know what it is about stuart <UNK> he is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place perhaps it are his looks i don't known this basically also was the reason why he got replaced in the lord of the rings the <UNK> of the ring also <UNK> <UNK> isn't much good and actually quite annoying in her female role and what was the point of having <UNK> griffith in this oh i guess i could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the jamie foxx character gets but i guess you get my point by now br br <UNK> just isn't much of an original writer director and on top of that he also doesn't handle his own material very well scenes often feel disjointed it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable on top of that the movie features some bad editing at times which also doesn't help to make this movie look like one <UNK> whole the movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that <UNK> hasn't made a movie ever since br br a too big mess to make you enjoy this movie br br 4 10
<START> 1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of <UNK> not far behind like don't go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as don't go into the woods but it's still not great either one thing is that it's just boring and acting isn't very good but much better than and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless <UNK> footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space br br so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldn't contain a fit of <UNK> when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon walk to get away from the and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl <UNK> to death with the sleeping bag and the <UNK> looking br br all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didn't find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better
<START> this movie is awful it creates characters not in the book and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl not to mention the <UNK> speaking <UNK> the book was a simple story about belief and this movie is a dark ugly and needlessly scary movie about nothing br br the animation is superb but the story has been ruined by hollywood br br the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from <UNK> with a story that needs no improvement hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used
<START> soderbergh is a fabulous director but nothing he could <UNK> could beat the amazing cast he gathered for this <UNK> of sequels clearly he knew this from the get go the term star vehicle has <UNK> been used to refer to a movie that builds itself around one star what this film does is net a whole herd of hollywood hot shots and make them shine even <UNK> than before the last scene says it all all the stars sitting around with nothing happening and nothing being said we just get to see them <UNK> as though it were a scene from a reality show where george clooney catherine zeta jones matt damon brad pitt and don cheadle are just hanging out being themselves so the story's not important at all at least that's not where the <UNK> greatest pleasures come from if you want a clever heist movie better stick with 11 but if star <UNK> turns you on this will make your day
<START> this movie is so over the top as to be a borderline comedy laws of physics are broken things explode for no good reason great movie to sit down with a six pack and enjoy do not i repeat do not see this movie sober you will die horrible death
<START> i watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology out do cecil b <UNK> classic epic of 1956 starring <UNK> heston <UNK> and sir cedric <UNK> of course i was let down yes they had all the biblical characters correct but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes that held your interest throughout the first movie if you going to have a mini series you have to have some scenes the burning bush <UNK> the red sea drowning <UNK> building <UNK> could have been done with <UNK> technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as lord of the rings or the matrix obviously they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of faith and sacrifice which is much needed in these trouble times
<START> of course i am going to think it was a great movie i recognized several people i didn't see during filming also i was the one playing the guard about an hour into the movie in the death row exercise yard asking for a light for a cigarette i also changed this one scene they had originally had it set to go into the <UNK> yard and <UNK> out the <UNK> and turn him around and walk him out the director said it is taking to long what would you do <UNK> i said we need to go in and hook the arms and drag him out backwards that way your camera can stay on his face as we take him off set i also lived at this same prison as a young child as my father was the assistant warden of security i am also a current employee with the <UNK> of <UNK> as a <UNK> at the maximum security institution even though a lot of the movie was a joke the part i was in was reality enough also in the bar scene the dancer kicking high in the air and leaving the stage was an actual stripper i use to work with at a club called the classic cat
<START> i've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film i'm in total <UNK> with almost every reviewer in saying that <UNK> <UNK> is crap crap crap crap crap don't the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini series the script is so dumb so pointless and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire <UNK> population but he somehow misses one guy that's <UNK> around trying to sell stuff to <UNK> give me a break and what was up with <UNK> sons acting like indiana jones saving girls in distress if all that isn't bad enough there's the part where god <UNK> to <UNK> and says i'm sorry <UNK> i was wrong <UNK> nbc god can not be wrong this film is the most tasteless and <UNK> biblical film ever made
<START> i enjoyed appreciated will view this movie again because i am sure there are subtleties that i missed wonderfully cast no over acting or cliché performance or plot uses a tragic event to reflect multiple relationships how those involved in each relationship are connected or <UNK> and <UNK> of life what position each one <UNK> in the relationship in life and how they cope with the confusion joy hurt and disappointment of discovering that things are not what they perceived them to be at first i thought there were <UNK> and the observed but that is not the case we are all connected somehow and our perceived <UNK> is only in small degrees i recommend the movie to everyone especially those in teaching social work religious <UNK> and every other person that <UNK>
<START> i don't know what it is about the crew from but everything they produce seems to be genius in its simplicity and stupidity <UNK> is so incredibly dumb and funny that it's almost comedic excellence sometimes it makes absolutely no sense but who cares br br it made me laugh my ass off a must have for the jackass <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was great in the <UNK> and especially all in the family he was also very good in <UNK> why on earth would he do this movie this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man luis <UNK> does the best he can but this is awful this movie was the beginning of <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> i think he is very funny but this is an awful awful pointless ghost story stick with <UNK>
<START> i don't think this can <UNK> qualify as film the plot was so flimsy the dialogue so shallow and the lines so terrible that i couldn't believe that someone actually wrote the lines down said holy sh t this is a masterpiece and then actually pitched it to a producer i for one am still <UNK> and will forever remember this film as the mark of the <UNK> of intelligence in america that and <UNK> of course
<START> medical student paula wins a place at an <UNK> <UNK> medical school when the body of a young man she met on the train turns up on her <UNK> table she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death and <UNK> a gruesome conspiracy <UNK> by an secret society operating within the school disturbing and gross lots of scary parts it even has a good script and ending but it has a one poor part what else could you see from this movie it's a good mystery and horror movie but of course if you like it go buy it if you don't there still is not reason to waste your money on this br br rated r for extreme graphic violence sexual situations and profanity
<START> i don't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended seeing american soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side and <UNK> wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side it certainly made the us forces look anything like the good guys was this supposed to be acceptable
<START> you got to see it to believe it shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy anything goes 70s this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day then again i bet it had a one week run actually its pretty hilarious the acting is dreadful the direction non existent but the hair clothes rotten pre disco music and the general out and out <UNK> of the story are mind <UNK> sleazy its very sleazy highly if you can find it
<START> forget jimmy stewart <UNK> his life and <UNK> for this smart comedy of errors instead i suppose only <UNK> <UNK> explains why this flick and <UNK> other great christmas story meet john <UNK> aren't <UNK> with the same level of love as well you know it's name br br stanwyck plays a food writer for a type <UNK> who has been lying for years to her pompous <UNK> about the <UNK> setting for her <UNK> she's an ace b s artist until the day <UNK> sailor is pulled from the ocean after 18 days <UNK> 6 weeks in a navy hospital released the last year of wwii the film is <UNK> with subtle patriotic gestures and holiday nostalgia but never sinks to sentimentality stanwyck is sexy and sassy as always and meets her match in the hunky morgan with whom it's love at first sight unfortunately she has to play married to <UNK> <UNK> architect who actually has been seeking her hand for years at his farm in <UNK> just to fool her boss br br s z adds a great deal of hungarian double <UNK> humor in support as <UNK> true source of <UNK> talent <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious as <UNK> obnoxious irish <UNK>
<START> i stumbled on to this site while looking for a video or dvd of the 1959 version and <UNK> with sammy davis as life if anyone finds this on a home movie format please let me know i talk to my daughters all the time about things that they think are new which actually have already been done we went to see a live theater of version a couple of years ago and all i could talk about was this film sadly my daughters cannot remember seeing sammy davis jr in any production although they have heard of him needless to say they're not familiar with the other great actors in the film it is a major <UNK> not to have this classic film because of the cast on a home movie format for <UNK> and for future generations anyway in my opinion this version was the best
<START> this is a poor excuse for a movie a film noir done by berkeley please first let's forget about the plot a truly simple minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde so what turns her from <UNK> him to loving him along with a group of other guys he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is off them it isn't exactly <UNK> but she's suddenly smitten it's truly painful to watch claude <UNK> trying to portray a hard bitten tough talking noir type cop a crooked <UNK> is his main and rather pathetic acting tool along with a <UNK> voice most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles how he ever got talked into taking this job i'll never understand enjoy it if you can for a few period details the old cars and gas <UNK> but don't expect a decent film experience it wasted 1 1 12 hours of my life
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona in fact his character pretty much carries this whole film or what's worthwhile about it the problem is with the exception of his gal pal played by marisa and paul as a trick date boyfriend for some of the characters no one else even comes close <UNK> plays a 30 something director of cuban <UNK> and unknown sexuality who comes to l a and gets a job making a gay documentary in the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects he comes out but very s l o w l y even at <UNK> minutes the film has obviously been stretched out and padded with various film school devices most of which only end up <UNK> <UNK> the narrative which ain't much to begin with or pointing out the overall amateurish <UNK> of the film making br br which is a shame because there's a love story in here somewhere and the final three minutes when <UNK> <UNK> finally <UNK> with a wealthy west hollywood party <UNK> nicely <UNK> by <UNK> henderson and they share some sexy <UNK> kisses it works despite all that came before but we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations why would handsome <UNK> have a <UNK> for a boyfriend he wouldn't and don't even get me started on friend <UNK> rules for dating no gay man i know hell no sane person period would put such <UNK> on himself or others and please tell me how <UNK> gets a <UNK> banana which is normally fairly right stuck up his butt and has to go to a doctor to get it removed br br i noticed <UNK> won an award for this film as a short it probably should have stayed that way all this said i'd look forward to seeing <UNK> on screen again in a better scripted comedy with more assured direction
<START> now i am not prone to much emotion but i cried seeing this movie it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups but there is something here for everyone the classic song it's so hard to say goodbye really makes this one worth watching at least once
<START> some people think of sweden in a negative way too neat too clean too serious too organized and too northern a people tortured by their own religious fate and history sometimes leading to depression and <UNK> heavy <UNK> this need not be a problem for a filmmaker as for example the late bergman has shown us what can be cinematic possible under these conditions bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not <UNK> comment on this identity as such br br however does the reverse he comments only on this identity <UNK> <UNK> his people to the bone in his world sweden is equivalent for hell on earth but he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly cannot step out of br br compared to his previous movie <UNK> songs from the second floor there is also not much progress to be observed the intention was that this was more accessible but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience aren't the best in the movie the same <UNK> and <UNK> also still apply there is the one shot camera position and the lack of action in front of this shot yes the stills are well done some of the scenes actually work and the <UNK> and <UNK> is amazing but does that make an interesting movie thinking in a negative way this is cinema taken a step backwards br br background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup but i find his movies about as empty as those commercials there is a message about mankind but it is trivial and without much depth
<START> if you've ever heard the saying the book is always better than the movie heart of darkness is no exception to the rule i believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because i read the book <UNK> with my english class we discussed each paragraph in great detail so i <UNK> the concept pretty quickly i couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie this may be because there were no discussions held in class but i suppose it is also because i couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel if you're the type of person who believes in that well known saying then leave watching the heart of darkness movie off your to do list
<START> as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct <UNK> of history but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no <UNK> i wish the director and or the screen writer had done his her research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a <UNK> that should not be there this movie portrayed the <UNK> and muslims in a very negative <UNK> while making the third group <UNK> look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations the inaccuracies coupled with the <UNK> disregard for one's faith as portrayed by was a disgrace to the highest format though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles both <UNK> k and <UNK> c played their rolls exceptionally i hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a <UNK> for the actual historical event
<START> you know you're watching <UNK> with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you i'm okay with the crappy lip <UNK> but the sound mix is really of too every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator either way this is pretty much the <UNK> between boring french <UNK> and the heavenly campy joe <UNK> flicks involving <UNK> and <UNK> don't get me wrong there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one but there's always room for more laura <UNK> stars and that's good because she's hot it's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure but she still rules over her white counterpart you can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her <UNK> of often every reason is good every person is good every location is good one scene even involves an entire hockey team whatever they are doing in africa sometimes the plot gets in the way and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people but there's enough laura <UNK> for all
<START> very tightly written acted and filmed violent but not too much so whoever edited this knew exactly what he wanted to portray there isn't a wasted scene in this movie the usual suspects was superb ensemble acting this is a collection of outstanding individual performances i rarely buy movies but this one is worth <UNK>
<START> this movie was really bad i mean really really bad the scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot and it was filmed in 2003 i think this was a great waste of time and money and michael <UNK> with his from scooby <UNK> image just made me laugh never waste your time with this picture i really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them the cat <UNK> fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene i think this is a beautiful example of bottom 100 picture
<START> red <UNK> plays a radio detective known as the fox in <UNK> in the dark also starring ann <UNK> conrad <UNK> eve <UNK> <UNK> grey and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> aka the fox finds his plans to marry his fiancé carol <UNK> <UNK> when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a <UNK> cult <UNK> joseph jones <UNK> has just learned that his cult the silver <UNK> is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew who is going to be living off of the interest he wants <UNK> to <UNK> a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney for <UNK> and because he's not sure which one is <UNK> fiancé jones kidnaps carol and also the radio daughter grey br br this to me anyway is a superior film to the second entry in this series <UNK> in <UNK> the plot is better the cast is better there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes <UNK> when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes is quite <UNK> and <UNK> is very good <UNK> always played these evil men to perfection eve <UNK> is <UNK> agent who <UNK> a date for him and grey to make sure his contract is <UNK> i had only seen grey in films from the 1950s <UNK> she was always a good looking woman but who knew she was such a <UNK> in the <UNK> and <UNK> this is a fun film with a neat cast
<START> oh god book ii is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it it is not all that funny its plot plays too much br br like a rejected situation comedy pilot and the use of the <UNK> think god is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original john denver had not returned for this movie and that made a big difference george burns as br br wonderful as he was playing god does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with john denver br br i would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10 but only for br br george burns the rest of the cast is nothing special br br if you loved the first one don't bother to see this one
<START> jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together they have made lots of movies together i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch i give the movie 10 out of 10 jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv they will be sadly missed god bless you both
<START> i don't know but the movie was just too similar to other movies i've seen the ring the eye dark water they're all the same to me don't get me wrong it's beautifully made lovely camera work great graphics but that story is just too too common in the end it's the score that makes the suspense you know the screams <UNK> the characters in the movie are also not <UNK> very naturally moving very slowly surprised by anything they see i know some people that love this kind of film and if you do being a well made movie i guess it doesn't hurt to watch it but if you've seen the movie i've mentioned above and didn't like them then i'd suggest you don't bother
<START> this has to be the greatest practical joke ever i'm amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face i might be wrong but the impression i get from this movie was that they <UNK> frank stallone and joe <UNK> into acting in this movie that has a budget of just under 40 depending on how much those bats and <UNK> painted equipment cost create the most incoherent movie ever created and sit back and laugh at the fact that joe <UNK> and frank stallone weren't in on the joke br br if by some chance they weren't kidding and they <UNK> tried to make a real movie then i feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation i've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies but this movie is so bad i can hardly watch it they repeat pointless special effects so many times that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage if i were forced to watch this movie on repeat i would <UNK> myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times through no offense to the great frank stallone but i would rather watch <UNK> teach a class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again
<START> this is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind one knows it's going to about a mute one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment br br well forget it the movie starts with a little black humour and then gets started from then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of <UNK> all right it must be said the unexpected twists are expected and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear <UNK> but this movie doesn't let you go br br it's like the old gangster movies but then without any <UNK> at all and in russia and that's one of the most important aspects of this movie it's <UNK> in russia this does have a great impact on the movie according to me it makes it better everything becomes simple and basic life is without nonsense this could be a great potential for more movies in the future gangster movies about the russian mafia br br it is a <UNK> and terrifying movie it's horror but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute one last advice don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well
<START> i agree with so many of the other reviewers here this was a great film and an even better novel by robert fish unfortunately i believe the author died before he could see this film made the performances are all top rate with the three principles john glover ben cross and <UNK> seemingly made for their roles the <UNK> both in europe and israel seem very authentic and the 4 hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story fortunately i did tape this when it was on television and have enjoyed watching it ever since i can say <UNK> that it holds up even to this day i gave it a rating of 10 if you haven't read the book you should really find a copy this would be an outstanding film to release on dvd with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast
<START> the best bond game made of all systems it was made of the best bond movie of all time if you don't have the game <UNK> you should rent it and if you don't have the movie <UNK> you should rent it also to better understand the game the best bond game of all
<START> to be i used to like this show and watch it regularly but now thank god i don't understand why did i watch it sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting tv shows i've ever seen i really don't get the point of this show despite of trying people are saying that sex and the city is funny in what way by <UNK> all the time talking about <UNK> and the size of the penis give me a break br br i don't understand the plot we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every <UNK> who comes around and this show is all about four spoiled chicks who are sleeping with every man in the city but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis <UNK> and yeah the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship if you can have a good sex you're a good husband or wife it doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart the size does matter br br the biggest problem is also bad acting the four main actresses sarah jessica parker kim <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> davis are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me sick just watching this show parker is just screaming and complaining all the time is showing her old boobs and saying the f word all the time davis delivers her smile and nothing else and <UNK> acts like she is bored all the time and yes men are sex hungry pigs in this show but judging by this show women are not much better this show is insulting for men and women the women are shown so primitive and <UNK> like they don't have any heart just <UNK> for sex it's insulting for everyone br br sex and the city is one of the worst tv shows and i'm glad that the show ended because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories the whole world is not all about sex and <UNK>
<START> what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter a <UNK> script great liberties taken with <UNK> life dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced <UNK> never gave up his believe in a higher power he may not quite rightly have believed in the established christian idea of god but was not an <UNK> which this film implies what would have been a riveting and much better film is if they had started with the <UNK> of on the origin of species and constructed a story of the great revolution that <UNK> and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides instead we got a plodding boring drama mostly made up a great injustice
<START> only few can understand character and to do that u most likely are <UNK> to see both sides of life and to face this reality is very hard and can lead some few to bad acts like character does but for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were good in the sense that the intention to save another from physical or mental in this case pain over long time and it is really sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes in it but the one character to make one through good intentions is killed by it the lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see realize face and make right of the real life situation u see and to make right or inspire one who can make right of a wrong situation but before that u have to see both sides of something and <UNK> it for the sake of long peace and <UNK> of all human life aka don't be ignorant
<START> well done melodrama that tells the story of sally <UNK> dancer in the circus raised by <UNK> performer played by w c fields he of the top hat little mustache <UNK> pants and <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and runner of carnival con games like three card <UNK> and the old shell game has raised sally who <UNK> him as her real father since <UNK> mother kicked out of her home by her father a judge when she married a circus man died and left sally <UNK> sally is <UNK> and loyal to no matter what he gets up to but seems to feel a bit of guilt over keeping her in the circus instead of with her own family all these years when they end up performing in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live uses the opportunity to investigate <UNK> real family with the idea that he may <UNK> her to them but grandfather the judge takes an immediate <UNK> to sally 'cause he doesn't like a show girl what a stern narrow minded man he is a real piece of work that guy and meanwhile sally is busy being pursued by a handsome and rich young man son of the man who helped grandpa get his <UNK> br br this is a very good film with a few laughs here and there and a sort of odd editing style i don't know how to describe this other than it shows long shots then sort of jumps back a few seconds or changes angle suddenly as a close up is shown carol <UNK> who plays sally is delightful here quite cute and comical in her performance w c fields even without his famous voice is very funny just the way he moves and his amusing comical reactions to things like a small dog seen in one funny scene we even see him <UNK> briefly in this i love the few <UNK> at the old fashioned circus and carnival that is shown here the print of this featured on the dvd is very nice looking <UNK> a light <UNK> tone and the piano score for this is really excellent performed by philip based on the original cue sheets
<START> well don't bother this film looks so tired the acting is so old fashioned and the plot and characters so drab that it should be studied instead of watched it is really a horrible waste of film stereotypes clichés nonsense and amateurish film making i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open how could such a film be made and more interestingly how could anyone find it funny or watchable old tired sloppy a junior high skit at best there is nothing watchable there except for a study of very ancient film not good film just ancient this is not <UNK> and <UNK> or laurel and hardy this is nonsense the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh some films are so bad that they are good but this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again
<START> while disney have been the animation studio for the past 70 years there have always been rivals to their supremacy when this review was written in 2009 for example companies like <UNK> and to a lesser extent warner brothers and were bringing out animated movies that could be said to challenge the disney <UNK> back in the beginning in that late <UNK> and early <UNK> <UNK> when disney was serving cinematic like snow white <UNK> and <UNK> the competition was provided by brothers dave and max <UNK> despite releasing two very commendable films they never quite <UNK> the market  many <UNK> their downfall to the commercial failure of mr bug goes to town released the same week as the attack on pearl <UNK> which gave the american public something more significant to think about than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon that this film has faded into relative obscurity is a travesty br br in a <UNK> of <UNK> garden in the city a bunch of bugs are in dire danger humans use the land as a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and other <UNK> right on top of the homes as they go honey shop owner mr <UNK> voiced by jack <UNK> fears that the future is bleak and wonders how he will ever be able to raise his daughter honey voiced by pauline in more secure surroundings a highly <UNK> creature <UNK> c beetle voiced by pierce offers to provide her a <UNK> place to live if she will accept his hand in marriage but honey is much more interested in her childhood sweetheart the cheerful and optimistic voiced by stan freed believes that everything is about to be resolved for the better but is left looking foolish when <UNK> beetle and his pair of comical <UNK> manipulate the crisis to their own <UNK> end only at the very end as their <UNK> becomes the foundation for a huge new <UNK> do the bugs switch loyalty back to as they look to him to lead them a new safe home away from the destructive influence of humans br br what really works in this film is the delightful characterisation  all the bugs are cleverly developed and designed for maximum audience appeal the bumbling villains <UNK> the fly and <UNK> the <UNK> hilarious names if you stop to think about it are particularly memorable equally admirable is the storytelling drive  even the youngest of children can enjoy this story while at the same time it <UNK> conveys a message for older audiences about the way human <UNK> can impact upon the survival of <UNK> time has inevitably dated some aspects of the film and when viewing it the audience needs to accept and forgive these occasional signs of general age and wear but on the whole mr bug goes to town is an accomplished funny and very <UNK> presented animation with a worthy message to boot
<START> this is a really mediocre film in the vein of <UNK> <UNK> the cast runs around like mad max <UNK> and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience <UNK> nicholson is one of the those guilty pleasure actresses you are delighted to stumble across in films but she isn't worth the price of rental space <UNK> starts an <UNK> fire and burns a vote of 4
<START> until i saw this film life is beautiful was my favourite film of all time this film is everything a great film should be great script <UNK> acting and direction that neither approaches the <UNK> the subject <UNK> nor leaves it without the emotional impact it demands this film contains the taste that could not come from hollywood and lacks the that would come from france a wonderful movie even above the <UNK> i have come to expect when i see the <UNK> films <UNK> come up i need not go into detail as the previous <UNK> <UNK> everything why this movie has to be seen by everyone on this planet
<START> this movie was never intended as a big budget film but was a cute little picture that pretty much anyone could enjoy it probably won't change your life but it is certainly charming and engaging br br <UNK> <UNK> plays a <UNK> that's certainly not new who has a tv however his ratings are failing and he is worried about <UNK> so he decides maybe he is too out of touch with kids as he and his wife have none of their own so he <UNK> as a and regrets doing this almost immediately remember he is a <UNK> and doesn't particularly like kids to make things worse one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy no matter how <UNK> he acts towards the kid the child just wants to spend time with him the kid is cute and nearly steals the show all by himself br br what happens next and the twists and turns of the movie are something you'll just have to find out for yourself understand that this is a light cute and yet not <UNK> movie you'll probably enjoy
<START> critics claim that this film is one of the worst films ever <UNK> also claim the same but there is a flip side to that <UNK> they are wrong very wrong it's the most clever film i've seen in ages br br from beginning till end you see a story thats unrealistic a story that <UNK> the real world this film is like a mirror you see yourself in another way that people see you to really understand the directors point of view you have to see it another time br br when you see this film try to understand the story and watch the background listen to the lyrics of the music and smell the industrial <UNK> br br this film is one of a kind you'll hate it most people do or you'll love it and understand it completely br br ernest <UNK> once said 'the world is a fine place and worth fighting <UNK> i agree with the second part
<START> dead man walking is one of the most powerful movies i have ever seen i find it hard to believe that anyone after having seen the movie could feel indifferent about the film or its message tim robbins does not try to <UNK> his ideas and beliefs on the viewers but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty whether it is right to murder a murderer or not i have always known where i stand in this question even as a child and this movie despite the fact that it does not really take any sides made me even <UNK> in my conviction that it can never be right to murder anyone br br sean penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of matthew his nomination for an academy award was very well deserved even if nicolas cage does a great job in leaving las vegas i would have been happier if penn had won the award susan sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the academy award she won and tim robbins certainly deserves the vote i have given this film 9 10
<START> a good but not great film the great dictator is <UNK> first <UNK> it's a good effort and at times a remarkable satire on hitler but unfortunately the moments of chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue yes chaplin the silent screen master just uses too many words in this film and his tendency towards writing long speeches and <UNK> <UNK> of dialogue would carry over into his other <UNK> films such as better <UNK> still chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in <UNK> roles is certainly memorable <UNK> doesn't have the glow she did in modern times her off screen affair with chaplin was <UNK> at the time but she is always worth seeing and jack <UNK> just about steals the show as a rival dictator to <UNK> famous creation
<START> this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets <UNK> calls telling her to check the children she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it not much suspense it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film at the beginning when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something whats up with that the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a beatles concert even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy don't waste your time with this <UNK> said
<START> this is horrible film it is past dumb first the only thing the twins care about is how they look and what boys like them they are in <UNK> grade not to say i am a <UNK> or anything but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages being pretty and popular is not everything but that is what the twins make it out to be the plot is even worse the girl's grandpa just happens to be the <UNK> to france he has a co worker take the girls around paris and they meet two cute french boys with <UNK> they <UNK> out to meet the boys start to really like them etc they meet a <UNK> in process and go around paris with total strangers they think are cute need i say more this movie may be cute to 8 9 year olds the twins play <UNK> losers that want boyfriends it makes sends the wrong idea to girls the film itself is not great either i don't <UNK> this to anyone i give <UNK> to paris 2 10
<START> my favourite story from <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> jones was born to play the part of the maniac <UNK> axe swinging madman steve dixon having seen him before in tango cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved a jealous husband takes <UNK> in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay the young worker ted billy <UNK> receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind now how is a blind <UNK> supposed to work a tribute to black humour if there ever was one the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial <UNK> about his wife <UNK> another man <UNK> behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues one even stated he became a changed man when he got married though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could
<START> city streets is amazingly modern technically speaking for a movie made in 1931 also who could not be <UNK> enthralled by gary <UNK> powerful <UNK> <UNK> the audience attention the plot is quite elaborate and clear the scenarios <UNK> are exceptional in every detail all the actors are above average i keep guessing how the director and his staff including editing sound lighting photography could have been so brilliant i couldn't find a flaw understanding that the scenes in the road <UNK> ride with the large motion pictures screen on the background was the best they could get in 1931 all in all i found this movie superb and so much alive thanks to gary cooper charisma
