<START> bon voyage has the fast pace that in some ways reminds me of the indiana jones star wars films it's as if you're on a fast train or roller coaster br br it's billed as a romance mystery thriller and farce it's all of that and more including <UNK> observations on the reactions of french society during the nazi invasion at the start of wwii and it's also an <UNK> of <UNK> that involves 7 main characters the scenes all seemed historically accurate to my eyes and gave an excellent feeling for the period br br all of the actors were well cast and gave great performances but imo the most superb was that by isabelle <UNK> who played the role of an <UNK> self centered french movie star not only did she quite convincingly play the role of a young actress perhaps half her age but she also played her <UNK> <UNK> convincingly yet in such a way that the audience sees she's only half serious and more complex as a person than just a gold <UNK> her character and energy <UNK> the film through from beginning to end it wasn't until i read roger <UNK> review that i discovered she was 48 years old at the time of the film what beauty br br i appreciated the ending it's satisfying but lets you write your own conclusion as to what happens to the main characters br br as another user <UNK> observed do not arrive late you need to be there from the opening scene good advice br br i gave it 9 of 10
<START> the duke is a very silly film a dog becoming a duke but it's a very fun movie it has some of those corny pranks that many kids movies have but thankfully no <UNK> function jokes as so many animal movies feel compelled to have mostly it's just dogs being dogs and people being well people the <UNK> <UNK> are likeable and appealing the <UNK> <UNK> are ridiculous and of course the pun of many jokes but there is something <UNK> about this movie for even though it is silly it's not out for every cheap laugh like home alone and others br br <UNK> simon and <UNK> do an excellent job playing black and <UNK> <UNK> who becomes the duke after his beloved owner a real duke dies for the most part they just act like dogs no ' or human like emotions and attitudes however they do stereotype <UNK> and <UNK> does fall for her just because she's a <UNK> come on these are dogs they have a different view of beauty br br overall charming fun and enjoyable
<START> in <UNK> director walt disney and animator <UNK> changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly <UNK> series the <UNK> dance and disney had been <UNK> together since the early <UNK> in disney's laugh o <UNK> cartoon series however their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when accepted an offer by a <UNK> to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year was hired by columbia pictures and decided to return to his old <UNK> for another dance this time in color br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is essentially a remake of the <UNK> classic the <UNK> dance the movie that <UNK> him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their <UNK> ready for the show that's about to begin as a group of <UNK> has formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy tune now it's not easy to be a musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put a good show and another group of <UNK> begin to dance a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it's hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the <UNK> run towards their graves br br directed and animated by <UNK> himself <UNK> <UNK> follows <UNK> the pattern set by the <UNK> dance years before although with a crucial difference did the whole film in technicolor the bright <UNK> allowed to create a more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and <UNK> than those he conceived before it is certainly a more experimental film than the <UNK> dance although sadly this doesn't mean it's necessarily a better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all br br however it is not the <UNK> of the concept what truly hurts the film after all <UNK> it in a wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming <UNK> and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w <UNK> for the <UNK> dance in other words while tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it's easy to forget about it rapidly while song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable being a musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down flawless work of animation personally i think that with a better musical <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would be remembered as <UNK> as the <UNK> dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it's still a fun film to watch br br it's kind of sad that most of the work did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if lacked the popularity of disney or <UNK> disney's main rival he did not lack the quality of those <UNK> films it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney's mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings <UNK> <UNK> is a very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can't help but thinking of the <UNK> dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that <UNK> are still here to haunt us and inspire us br br 8 10
<START> awful awful awful show real world issues dealt with blatant <UNK> stereotypes <UNK> what the hell is going on with the african american black guys <UNK> <UNK> power awful awful awful awful awful show the fact that it lasted three seasons <UNK> belief this show truly is <UNK> for the brain dead of mediocrity br br saved by the bell almost seemed humorous compared to this well upon <UNK> no it's of the same banal <UNK> and therefore equally devoid of intelligence the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message the mentality and deliverance is the same yet somehow feels evil and soulless you can almost hear the tv executives buzz words at each other in fact i felt so <UNK> at this shows existence i felt compelled to comment br br awful awful awful show
<START> even though this is the first film by the broken lizard group it's the last one i saw having mildly enjoyed super troopers and managed to sit through the crap that is club and i was surprised to hear they did an earlier film now i didn't sit down with high hopes but was hoping for a funny campus romp my friend asked me to keep in mind they are younger obviously and its their first <UNK> into film i did and was still disappointed not taking away the acting and comedy skills of the <UNK> guys they were ok the whole film was tiresome clich√©d and frankly boring some of the other actors in the film were really poor at acting and the <UNK> game didn't even resemble <UNK> poor showing they improved drastically with super troopers and have <UNK> since lets hope they get back on form with super troopers 2
<START> before we start may i say i hope you've already eaten when you're reading this why because after i'd seen this film for the first time the <UNK> look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'the <UNK> had appeared on the screen so don't say you weren't warned br br fred <UNK> might have directed earth vs the flying <UNK> an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim <UNK> mars attacks but the giant claw is not that giant a film yes it's a <UNK> monster that flies in the air attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a <UNK> the beast is giant except in the scenes where it's considerably smaller but who needs consistent proportions in a movie scary it could have been but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from <UNK> street
<START> with a single act br br charlie wilson <UNK> a real character during the 90s when the communism on <UNK> the wall of berlin and the war on with the <UNK> broke over he did it a single denial for money and everything went down he should be remembered so here it is his <UNK> br br back to the movie funny dramatic <UNK> <UNK> or just boring anyways it's a smart movie about <UNK> life about <UNK> the world and about above all a lesson to the world a lesson to every <UNK> out there a critical point of view referring to countries who support wars with money guns and words br br lesson learned world isn't a nice place to live in
<START> jeremy <UNK> and forrest <UNK> are good actors but this movie was badly written first of all during the <UNK> scene <UNK> sits too <UNK> in his chair he appears to be reading something and rather <UNK> too perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes also the violence at the <UNK> was a big letdown slow mo bullets flying how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost his <UNK> afterward wasted another 10 minutes then he decided to get revenge and talk to all his industry journalist friends and <UNK> he's a journalist for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lo and behold they actually give him <UNK> on where to find the bad guys how do they know but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when <UNK> finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out but not the baddies who killed his wife and blows them away anyway so he's just a murderer he gets away and well i shut it off i mean i couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original <UNK> instead he's going after their friends i guess or anyone who hangs out in <UNK> and leaves automatic weapons laying around the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame it's ok son crying helps he says to his son son says no it doesn't and father says you're right it doesn't <UNK> takes on questionable roles like that one dragon movie he did he was excellent in <UNK> <UNK> which is a completely different animal than this <UNK> thriller
<START> as with most viewers of this film i'm an avid reader of the books the first 2 films have buck ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play second <UNK> to louis <UNK> <UNK> presidential effort world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book series br br the problem is this film is as awful as the first two amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series other illogical parts feature i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2
<START> nice movie and tom does a fantastic job playing the guy in the girl's body she really does it well br br a sort of teen version of many other movies but well done br br well casted from matt to
<START> <UNK> baby is always underrated most likely because it has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that a <UNK> movie gets all that the pg means is that pam doesn't take her top off she takes her top off in every other movie she's been in though so it is more exciting than <UNK> more action it takes off slow but by the time she's on screen the thrills have started like <UNK> martin is the heavy trying to get <UNK> father but she ain't having that she <UNK> a one woman war against martin and his gang of <UNK> the best scene is with a stupid <UNK> in his car which i'm still laughing about i thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating but i was wrong it <UNK> sex with violence and in a film that can only be good
<START> yet another tv show becomes a movie steve the office carell plays <UNK> agent <UNK> smart in a movie that's so bad it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw the seventh rate story if you can call it that has a <UNK> trying to take over the world it is so unfunny it is absolutely pathetic about the only thing anne <UNK> does as agent 99 is look good she seems incapable of doing anything else bill murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds and a few faces from the tv series turn up in very small roles movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film it is neither even though i really was not a fan of the tv series at least it was light years ahead of this piece of hit all this does is drag it through the dirt and <UNK> whatever good memories we had of it thank god don adams is not here to see it keep it up hollywood keep making crappy movies like this and keep 'em to the <UNK> on a weekly basis no wonder the film industry is going down the <UNK> this movie is so rotten it's not even good for laughs if this movie were a newspaper it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage there is absolutely no reason to see this movie a root <UNK> is more enjoyable than this rating zero minus five stars unless you are a <UNK> stay away better still do what the title says get smart and save your nine bucks you will be able to buy about 2 <UNK> of gas with it put it in your car and be thankful you did not waste it going to a <UNK> to see this bomb
<START> great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food br br joan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> should fire their agents
<START> ok so i know better than to watch movies on scifi er sorry <UNK> or or whatever it is now so sue me i spent my whole saturday doing <UNK> board for a i can be forgiven for <UNK> into my <UNK> and wanting to watch some movie i'd never seen rather than read <UNK> in the original or learn how to play the br br which is to say i didn't deserve open graves of which i saw none incidentally were there any did i fall asleep why is it called this br br some <UNK> visuals not many scares as with too many films in modern horror films no reasons are given apart from shared humanity to care about any of these people half a point though for the <UNK> <UNK> who was clich√©d but did have one good scene br br it all sort of plays like final destination delivered via a board game the game does have an intriguing look to it and it involves one of my favorite old <UNK> i'll give it that much the <UNK> there is that the game possessed more personality than most of the characters br br as for the end if you didn't see it coming then i think you fell asleep somewhere back around the dawn of the genre
<START> for years i <UNK> watching this movie now i know why it was even worse than i'd expected <UNK> <UNK> makes the worst movie mistake of his career since <UNK> where's my car ' tara reid co stars as the girl of dreams who asks him to <UNK> her father and his boss 's pet owl for the weekend the rules 1 no shoes in the house 2 no people in the house 3 the <UNK> son stays out of the house 4 don't touch the furniture br br well you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes how the rest of the film is going to turn out br br you know there are films like meet the parents where bad things happen to someone but it's entertaining to watch and it's delivered in a way that you can't wait to see what happens next this is not one of those films you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen it's an extremely frustrating movie to watch and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off because it was so bad but i paid the rental <UNK> and figured i had to watch it now br br tara reid was good and i would like to see her in more films though i'm not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career br br the end result is a happy ending but of course with the kind of film it is you would expect nothing short of that br br don't watch it you'll sincerely regret it
<START> this is a video version of a stage production with extra shooting for the video edition the result <UNK> both the drama of the stage with the impact of well produced film the set by george with <UNK> and masks by julie are superb br br norman is terrific and one gets to hear and see the young this production is stunning emotional and <UNK> if you don't see this you have missed out
<START> at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and <UNK> film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull <UNK> getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy <UNK> along the <UNK> world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet <UNK> in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a <UNK> bill <UNK> as <UNK> winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james <UNK> as <UNK> to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three <UNK> off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james <UNK> at age <UNK> looks a bit long in the tooth to be a <UNK> especially when the sign at the <UNK> office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be <UNK> br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding
<START> yes this is one of the <UNK> of the black action genre confusing mixture of racist comedy and racist violence at times reaching a disturbing pitch even for a fan of the genre this movie isn't your <UNK> in the park wonderful bits of <UNK> ray moore comedy stand up that don't seem funny at least not to a white boy like me but great in context much better than its <UNK> sequel the human <UNK>
<START> when i was driving home after work i bought some movies for my four year old twins i had bought this movie my kids would enjoy i watched this with my children my 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up in this movie the dad acts like a <UNK> my little ones would watch it every day one day they threw away all our movies i sold the jones movie on ebay my grade f i rather be seen on the worst dress list br br my kids now hate this dumb movie if gives the idea that <UNK> can talk to each other i wonder how the dumb movie sounds in <UNK> i broke the cd in half when i got irritated of seeing it over and over again no <UNK> but <UNK> acting was the best
<START> i've heard many things about beowulf maybe because i'm from romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here in my country and i expected a lot from this film at the end i was disappointed it is not as horrible as other users said but it's <UNK> bad it's all about a monster killing people in a <UNK> century castle and <UNK> the one who comes to kill him <UNK> is good as he is in all his roles but the rest of the characters suck and the action isn't too good either plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film the special effects are also very bad the monster looks awful not scary but awful oh and another bad thing the music the movie tries and manages to create the <UNK> century atmosphere but all the action sequences are presented on rock music which is very very bad i mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like charlie's angels where that's the perfect way to shoot your action but here that was a very bad idea br br vote 4 out of 10
<START> all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate it's gotta be the use of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is <UNK> iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and <UNK> is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes <UNK> iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called <UNK> mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in <UNK> 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber <UNK> and a handful of <UNK> this sucked
<START> i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful <UNK> theatre i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography the brilliant adaptation of a very <UNK> play and last but not least the <UNK> performance of al pacino who was born to play this role which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy <UNK> br br the film <UNK> explores the themes of love vs loyalty law vs justice and passion vs reason some might protest that the content is <UNK> anti <UNK> however they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation br br 9 10
<START> another enjoyable warner flick i really liked john garfield in this though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces i mean it's another dead end kids story of sorts too but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama the boys work great with garfield a nice sequence was the whole swimming scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster br br one negative comment claude <UNK> was grossly miscast as the detective the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a <UNK>
<START> four unhappy women leave dreary london to spend an enchanted april in a castle on the coast of italy br br elizabeth von <UNK> novel comes alive in this charming little film which beautifully demonstrates the virtues of a <UNK> script and ensemble acting all the elements come together to produce a movie that although nearly forgotten now still produces a feeling of appreciation at the story's appropriate resolution br br the actresses each <UNK> themselves <UNK> ann <UNK> is the free spirited wife longing for far from <UNK> london <UNK> alexander plays the quiet housewife wishing for the elegant responsibility of acting as <UNK> in the castle jane <UNK> is the beautiful young <UNK> escaped from her <UNK> of male <UNK> jessie ralph steals every scene she's in as an old lady wanting only to be alone with her memories of the past br br the men in the story are also well cast as miss husband frank morgan has a rather complex role as a <UNK> <UNK> who has a disturbing personality change when he becomes a successful writer <UNK> owen as miss <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> pompous as a man well <UNK> to bore for england his hilarious attempt to take an english bath in an italian <UNK> is made even funnier with the assistance of charles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> servants finally ralph forbes one of the <UNK> finest forgotten actors is <UNK> eccentric as the <UNK> lighthearted <UNK> br br movie <UNK> will recognize an uncredited <UNK> playing the <UNK> of the <UNK> club
<START> what garbage is there actually no part ii if this movie actually ends the way it did everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed this movie is nothing close to a movie like <UNK> which was actually a fairly decent movie this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars i started watching the movie under the <UNK> that it would be bad but i never imagined it would be this bad this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit if you have not seen this movie don't bother movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks stay away don't be fooled by the hype
<START> if you took a really good jack black movie added a little <UNK> <UNK> and then a dash of <UNK> with a hint of texas chainsaw massacre and house of a 1000 corpses you would have monster man i went into this movie not really expecting much at all but i wound up really enjoying the movie the whole premise is really cheesy a monster man in a monster truck chases down people but it is so funny that the writer director doesn't expect you to take it seriously justin <UNK> is a comic gem and should have a very promising career he is identical to jack black the only problem with the film is the unbelievable hero role played by eric but overall if you are looking for a really really fun movie that will crack you up until you are rolling in the <UNK> and at the same time scare the crap out of you check out this film
<START> how many english 101 <UNK> versions of 1984 must america endure gosh this is a great book but kind of a <UNK> i know i'll write one just like it where everything works out okay i'll also replace <UNK> old used up political insights from the thirties with my own insightful informed opinions form the 1970s think think political insight evil politicians i'm a genius and there will be <UNK> that they make of themselves for some diabolical reason i'll work on that it'll work no it won't bob sullivan writer of this story this really is all you're fault you could have stopped them early and said guys with our budget and acting abilities i was thinking romantic comedy or we could move away form taking ourselves so seriously and make a campy spoof this tired familiar genre of movies did you do that though bob no you didn't and you've had 28 years to think about it br br i don't mean to be so <UNK> i'm sorry i <UNK> at you bob you've obviously had to live with this mistake a lot longer then i have some blame really should go to ron smith who helped you adapt the screenplay he could have stopped you at any time you were young and naive and he took advantage of you now he <UNK> the plots for video games and you bob well who knows what you do i'm sorry if that sounds harsh bob but that's the way it is you were sold <UNK> by the hollywood <UNK> as if ron wasn't enough michael bay also saw your movie and without even asking for rights or anything added some explosions to your concept and turned it into the island that i think is the most disgusting part of all that with a little eye candy your script could of easily been good enough for a major hollywood production which i'd of hated just as much as this movie and not felt sorry for you at all br br i'm sorry things worked this way for you bob ron and michael walked all over you leaving you a <UNK> shell of a man who's height of movie writing greatness will be a joke on mystery science theater 3000 don't focus on that though bob because <UNK> works in mysterious ways and one day they'll pay for what they did to poor little bob sullivan
<START> this is a candidate for worst films i've ever seen it wanted to be as shocking as silence of the <UNK> but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned the make up is excellent the acting is pretty good but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they're more disturbing than entertaining
<START> poor jane austen this dog of a production does not do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice starting at the top poorly adapted the screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to come to think of it i don't know what she was trying for but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years couple that with all the over acting and awful production values this is one adaptation that should never have happened it would have been far better if they just gave all the money they <UNK> into this flop and <UNK> it to a worthy charity do yourself a favor read the book it is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production
<START> this is a great film with an amazing cast <UNK> glover is at his <UNK> his guitar solo is amazing also watch out for a cameo by william <UNK> truly a cult classic this is on my top ten list don't miss this twisted film
<START> im a huge m <UNK> fan that's why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming it's a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7 10 br br the suspense of wondering what <UNK> was actually up to was what really <UNK> me interested in this movie br br its a good rental br br 7 10
<START> an astronaut michael dies while returning from a mission and his body is <UNK> by the military the base where the dead astronaut is taken to becomes the scene of a bizarre invasion plan from outer space alien <UNK> inside the dead astronaut <UNK> the corpse and begin a terrifying assault on the military staff in the hopes of <UNK> the world according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br a roger corman american international production the man who fell to earth <UNK> mr as john <UNK> does all right angela greene is his pretty conflicted fianc√©e and ed nelson as dave randall is featured as <UNK> with a bigger budget better opening and a re write for <UNK> characterizations this could have been something approaching classic 1950s science fiction br br night of the blood beast 1958 bernard l <UNK> roger corman michael angela greene ed nelson
<START> personally i can only but agree with stephen 12 <UNK> there's really no point in trying to this film i like movies where nothing <UNK> happens <UNK> der has got the same <UNK> though that movie is less convincing since the <UNK> are rather in the beginning of the story so <UNK> had to focus on nature versus kinski <UNK> a <UNK> is wholly different though since it has several <UNK> turns etc in fact from the point where <UNK> is lost the movie almost to its grand finale his final of sand begin running through the <UNK> after the moment of bliss where he <UNK> about warning the polish family and <UNK> hair br br you can if you want to seek some real clues symbols in this one his trying to leave behind his <UNK> from the moment he arrives the pointing at the end the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in but there's no point in doing this it won't make the film better or worse since its force lies in the whole <UNK> which is never made explicit tons of history <UNK> europe the end of the <UNK> <UNK> as we've come to know it which has <UNK> to be only the beginning of it individual emotions expression are more important now than they ever were but wait now i myself am beginning to develop the one minor tiny flaw of the film the <UNK> talk about <UNK> parts now there's one thing never to do i myself believe it could have been expressed by other means furthermore i believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film br br i don't like explicit films i can read books so i don't want a storyline that speaks merely to my <UNK> i prefer films that you cannot explain in words but only in film lynch's lost highway <UNK> at hanging rock and <UNK> man who fell to earth also belong in this category for then and then only it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book so what about thomas <UNK> <UNK> i've never read it but forget about it the movie gives a different point of view it says things you can never say in a book it uses the movie art to make you feel through images and music the same thing that mann made you feel using text equally brilliant but different worlds
<START> <UNK> should be ashamed to be involved with this awful film the acting directing and script are all third rate with the entire film playing out like an excuse for writer director star larry bishop to get laid the only reason it was made at all is most likely due to his association with <UNK> the plot of the film is pretty flimsy and basically tries to survive on not so obscure references to older b movies and some cameos from guys like david carradine dennis hopper and <UNK> jones each one is <UNK> in their performance particularly hopper who is in full on paycheck mode at this point in his career the saving grace if there is one is that the script is so laughably bad that it can be entertaining bishop tries so hard to get that trademark <UNK> banter and just fails miserably which can be pretty humorous at times and grating at others i'd only check this one out if you love bad movies or if you're really into biker films
<START> okay i can sit through almost any movie and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it br br having served in the us army there are certain expectations in a movie including the military at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank uniform and <UNK> is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience bats human <UNK> had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the <UNK> and later in the movie the time was listed as 11 00 hours but it was full dark outside even if the script was perfectly done and the dialogue spectacular and the acting oscar worthy if the people making the movie don't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it
<START> i am an avid fan for instance i have the game then sell it bad mistake but then buy it again good mistake <UNK> br br anyways yes this film is very good the fights are very cool music very good and the cgi you cant <UNK> br br only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement it was almost all cloud which although is a great character u cant beat a of <UNK> and <UNK> br br but despite that the film was great in my opinion and a must watch br br overall a great film give and will give it 9 10 br br make more films like this and you'll be <UNK> more so than you already are
<START> if you have ever seen a bollywood movie you know they are longer than most movies due to the multiple song and dance routines each one is over five minutes long fortunately this one has fewer song and dance routines and fits into the standard movie length don't get me wrong i like bollywood movies but tend to fast forward through the song and dance portions i bought this dvd because i am an ian fan although his role wasn't as large as i hoped he still had a good amount of screen time and his character was much different than his other roles br br overall this was a good movie like most bollywood movies there is at least one element of controversy conflict of the traditional indian culture but true love <UNK> over <UNK> and a happy ending is had by all
<START> spoilers spoilers it's easy to see why the script for this film won an oscar at least during the first half my head was spinning from all of the snappy lines <UNK> by <UNK> coward plays a new york <UNK> why don't you <UNK> books that you like ' what and corrupt the public ' who charms and <UNK> his many <UNK> on then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre flying <UNK> take off in which coward must find someone who truly <UNK> him before his soul can rest in peace very enjoyable until it gets bizarre viewed at <UNK> in in march 2003
<START> abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre lousy audio thankfully <UNK> the dumb dialog and it's awfully talky for a movie about people who don't speak english there's no adventure to be found here it's a jungle adventure with <UNK> and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback br br three pale face <UNK> wander the african wilderness and encounter <UNK> man hungry <UNK> of <UNK> these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to <UNK> makeup shoes and hair <UNK> technology despite their desperation for the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones br br the only thing of interest as if there were any question is the assortment of young women clad in animal <UNK> cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951 plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with 1950s stripper moves no nudity or <UNK> violence on the other hand you may be <UNK> the catchy native song for days
<START> the <UNK> runner should win an oscar it's perfect in every sense the story the script the acting the cinematography one would never guess it was filmed in china the story of two childhood friends and what follows in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression the depiction of life in afghanistan under the <UNK> is all too real and horrifying i have not read the book but i have seen comments that put down the movie because the book is always better it doesn't really matter no one put down gone with the wind because it wasn't true to the book as a matter of fact it won the academy award for best picture and several other oscars i think this movie is brilliant bravo to the writer and director and the actors
<START> stealing is a crime and these guys kenny and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it i haven't even seen this film but not only do i know it sucks but the fact that it steals the story of another film or 2 films for that matter is such bull crap and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all o k that's a little much but stealing is worse br br ever seen it was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008 this radio host goes into work and then this zombie attack happens we only see what's going on inside the radio station and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation from all the reviews i've read and from the conversation i had with my friend who has seen this film and this film was exactly like it in the story with minor <UNK> here and there so throw originality and creativity out the window as for the zombies or the infected whatever you want to call them they are the exact same thing just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around <UNK> and have a never ending <UNK> for flesh they are zombies zombies br br zombies okay one to many but back to this crappy movie the zombies from what i've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 days later another better movie with their insane rage and even more insane <UNK> of flesh this is where zombie movies define themselves story does not matter in a zombie movie as long as your not taking the idea of another film sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story as is the case with but the zombies have to be in a way original 28 days later started the insane raging zombie i can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film the evil dead i think all i have to do is just type the name again because come on it's the evil dead romero is the master and he went through all different types of zombies from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead and he did each one with his own unique style br br so after talking about other great zombie movies i think it's about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it this movie down right steals the original story outline to which i think is called <UNK> and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing yet in hollywood it's allowed and apparently <UNK> of this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie and just tries to tell it differently the 90's is like the worst period for movies ever sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't and it's because all the movies were the exact same my favorite the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end they force feed you one suspect make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him then <UNK> all this time it was this guy you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue say hey guys what did i miss oh didn't see that coming did ya well i'll leave a clich√© as my closing statement this is one film you'll surely want to miss
<START> this a lovely and charming epic fantasy with lots of heart i got lost in this sweet film watching it at the <UNK> chinese theatre in hollywood it's truly romantic with a touching message the artwork and the effects are visually striking and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so apparent the frames are like watching moving art it also has a strong and talented cast of actors what a wonderful surprise to see <UNK> <UNK> he is just a fairy tale perfect king sarah douglas is terrific as the villain and christine taylor and tom <UNK> make a lovely romantic pair the fact that the movie was made on a ridiculously tiny indie film budget just blows me away it may not be the slick hollywood stuff we're <UNK> by but it's a really nice movie to rent and enjoy <UNK> up on your <UNK> on a rainy saturday don't forget the <UNK> popcorn that's my advice just enjoy it
<START> before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away from the credits i was falling of my seat i just couldn't contain myself the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy is the absolute double for the jewish <UNK> who comes back from fighting in the war due to the <UNK> of the <UNK> he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had but things went wrong and <UNK> was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish 'the due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the <UNK> and <UNK> got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for and consequently takes his the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic it the morals which society could only dream about in the speech it <UNK> the whole meaning of the film because of the and which it <UNK> and it <UNK> works because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest most prominent things such as war
<START> great acting great production values good direction br br but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered br br the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow through is weak for instance we're very clear that <UNK> <UNK> is pro war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film br br this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea br br the depiction of the war itself is heart <UNK> accurate though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war <UNK> that swept britain at the time perhaps this is historically accurate like so much in this film i simply don't know
<START> has all the ingredients of a good joel <UNK> film intelligent youthful characters stunning cinematography a gripping story and excellent performances it's <UNK> fun but it's done very well and <UNK> with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving br br <UNK> has a knack for <UNK> talented young actors and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things see the cast list their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average <UNK> sutherland shines in his <UNK> <UNK> student role br br the cinematography really <UNK> the right side of the brain which is what i love about <UNK> his use of light and location create images that stick a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which <UNK> you while you watch the film and <UNK> you when you go to bed reminded me of the lost boys br br this is a film that takes an awesome premise curious students want to find out what's after death and successfully follows it through into a scary gripping tale of redemption one of <UNK> best highly recommended
<START> movies just don't get worse than this horrible plot terribly timed pathetic characters and effects and yes this is using b standards br br and for the guys nothing this movie is a terrible let down couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build up with no delivery br br this movie appeals to no one horrible movie it had bad plot acting b flavor special effects and everything else plus no nudity or for guys or the girls
<START> dean cain the one time super man plays max hooper the super thief he can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product now the thief finds himself having to be the hero <UNK> everyone in the building unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the f b i c i a are outside waiting for max br br the movie is barely passable dean cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is <UNK> with a weak script and pretty poor direction
<START> when i first saw it 9 years ago when i was 9 i thought it <UNK> i'm 18 now and i still think it stinks i mean <UNK> no special effects or anything it was boring and kinda anti climatic my cousin watched once and george <UNK> <UNK> kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better but they kept cutting to the budget it would have been a great episode but it was a terrible movie
<START> comments must've been written on <UNK> <UNK> day because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth br br <UNK> <UNK> is hilarious in every scene in every way the chemistry between <UNK> and cooper could not have been <UNK> supporting cast is superb br br writing and direction are magnificent br br like so many other comments on this board again i <UNK> why can't films be like this anymore br br this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best folks
<START> then you will be a big fan of this movie its almost the same basic concept a nice mixture of music soul and drama i'll admit i was a little about seeing this movie i had only seen previews of a white trash girl <UNK> to a <UNK> but i am a big fan of samuel l jackson and i enjoyed <UNK> flow so i thought i would give it a chance br br i'm very glad that i did it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a <UNK> southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man the story had heart and was very influential br br the music in this movie also added a nice touch craig <UNK> mixed his style from <UNK> flow into this movie except took a new spin and used the blues his musical scenes are still at the top of the <UNK> as far as performance scenes go by he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes br br no doubt if you liked <UNK> flow you will love this movie and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this i give it a 9 out of 10 very interesting film and it is extremely under rated shame br br go out and rent this movie
<START> ten minutes of people <UNK> <UNK> of pink vomit recurring scenes of enormous <UNK> of dog <UNK> need one say more
<START> i watched this film in a <UNK> theatre yesterday 4 <UNK> 2006 and came away with a better understanding of what <UNK> patients and their loved ones go through br br ms <UNK> must be <UNK> for not only taking on a difficult subject but also treating the mentally challenged with a deep understanding of their <UNK> that is necessary to help them cope with the trauma of <UNK> hallucinations and the storm of turmoil raging in their minds br br we have had hollywood movies on this subject such as one flew over the <UNK> nest where jack nicholson carried away the <UNK> since then research has helped provide more insights into the problem and <UNK> some <UNK> about treatment in <UNK> nest for example shock therapy has been portrayed as <UNK> but in 15 the point has been made that it is not as bad as it has been made out to be br br the other <UNK> is that abuse in childhood is a cause for <UNK> but <UNK> such as dr e fuller have <UNK> that studies have shown that childhood <UNK> is a brain disease and is thought to have some genetic roots br br it is now established that <UNK> can be treated like any <UNK> <UNK> and its advance can be checked if <UNK> early even in fairly advanced stages regular <UNK> and <UNK> can be effective br br the same understanding shown by ms <UNK> is evident in the way the actors play out their parts in keeping with the gravity of the theme the acting is controlled throughout with ms <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and eyes <UNK> the helpless confusion of a disturbed mind speaking <UNK> than some of the <UNK> we are used to in most of the movies that have included mentally challenged characters br br like me most of the audience in the theatre appeared confused at the abrupt ending it leaves lot of questions hanging in terms of the plot br br has search ended why is she not found in no 15 were children actually playing when <UNK> past the gates with her eyes <UNK> with recognition can anyone sort out this jigsaw puzzle
<START> is it full moon tonight oh it doesn't matter they can change whenever they want <UNK> of that drug what was i thinking if its full moon tonight <UNK> br br i really like this movie there's romance suspense horror and hot stuff i like the first half of the movie when the guy saves the girl from killing herself by jumping and catching her that was really cool the setting of this movie is in the city of love which is paris in france the cemetery scenes are nice it gives you chills not knowing what will happen there or who's behind the walls the scenes that makes you jump out of your seat is really cool even they got me on that scenes his friend who died and the girl whom he killed in the cemetery but still shows themselves to the lead character sorry i forgot his name was really funny the actors did a good job plus the make up <UNK> the part when they're all <UNK> in an abandoned church i can't believe people would that because even though that's an abandoned church that is still god's house i bought this movie long time ago and i do not regret buying it i'm a horror movie lover i give this movie 5 stars out of 6 for the people who are open and loves movies like this give it a try you might like it
<START> i was watching the beginning of this on a friday mid day while working at computer at home relaxing a bit after a <UNK> week and cleaning up some files and answering some <UNK> got interrupted a couple of times so had trouble getting all the details straight although it's hardly a work of hitchcock proportions where missing a detail can through the whole story off <UNK> and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of work br br so during a commercial read the only prior comment here by 1 and pretty much can agree with its details br br not quite in the category of a film so awful it is <UNK> good but i'd like to catch on tape when run again rather than seeing it as aired so i can fast forward as needed and see the parts which i missed this first time br br give it a 3 because of the <UNK> of the four primary characters
<START> it's funny how time went by and never saw this movie <UNK> last week when i was like under a spell i saw it twice in a week and it still wasn't enough it's a great movie and i will love to see it again the story is great and it really moved me i would love to live such a story the actors are great the music too and you can dream about your own love story i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby i feel like dance <UNK> people and brings them together i think people should learn to dance it helps a lot especially in a relationship it's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body
<START> ok i have seen just about everything and some are considered classics that shouldn't be like all those halloween movies that suck crap or even steven king junk and some are considered just ok that are really great like carnival of souls and then some are just plain ignored like evil ed or <UNK> head and brain dead the bud <UNK> one then some stick in your head once seen and never leave that's what this did to me and for my money this is much better than last house on the left last house was great till the ending then it blew <UNK> what kind of <UNK> is gonna give a blow job to someone who just killed their kids completely stupid go find the movie bully or even funny games if ya want realism and to be creep ed out but this damn thing stuck with me for years one cause chuck <UNK> always was scary two <UNK> roberts is the best female victim ever three the chick being <UNK> in <UNK> still is one of the all time worst killings on film and 4th the <UNK> powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected not to mention the <UNK> wax figures puppets etc it should be right there with psycho last house texas chainsaw etc it's a classic and deservedly so
<START> i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here i saw the whole movie by fast <UNK> and ended in 25 minutes though its a low budget movie it could have been made better br br the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately and why was the movie named crash landing when it was landed so well in such a bad climate br br without any acting all the characters where just moving or doing like kids br br and should not forget to comment on the joker the main <UNK> who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy
<START> i saw the star of this movie on the daily show and thought i might tune in the movie premiered on comedy central then went into theaters oh <UNK> br br this makes shakes the clown look like citizen kane avoid avoid avoid at all costs not one laugh not even a grin this movie will make your face come out in <UNK> and your eyes burst like the last of <UNK> i can't even think of a worse movie be it <UNK> or <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> run away run away why did anyone green light this unless they used their own money the horror is that there is not one good line not one good joke and only one bad thing the making of this movie br br i feel that if made properly this would have been hilarious as it is i need a new <UNK> for <UNK> so loud damn anyone involved in this travesty
<START> i am not so old that i can't remember laughing at <UNK> <UNK> a couple times but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells br br from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line <UNK> obviously hates himself so much that he needs to <UNK> in order to feel better even if it is his own imaginary characters he <UNK> br br if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny <UNK> was 15 years ago this movie is worse it was not even funny by accident it is sad pathetic and a total waste of time may hands be rendered <UNK> so he can not write another script strike his tongue so he can not <UNK> another unfunny scene he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood
<START> i absolutely love the first three movies they were great i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 years ago and i was disappointed but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one because they were shot back to back but after finally viewing a copy today i have to say it was no way better than number 5 my expectations weren't high to begin with but this is cheap direct to video stuff not even a horror movie it's pg 13 the acting was not convincing the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight but come on br br surprisingly both parts 4 and 5 were directed by sequel director jeff <UNK> who gave us the excellent <UNK> ii and <UNK> texas chainsaw massacre iii i liked puppet master the legacy even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies br br overall puppet master is very much like the <UNK> series a great trilogy but forget the rest
<START> return to me is a charming gem of a movie with an absolutely star <UNK> cast who can go wrong with this modern day fairy tale it also includes many many jokes written by the funny girl herself bonnie hunt who wrote and directed this film david duchovny is also very good showing a different approach then from his <UNK> alter ego <UNK> on my favourite show the x files a great date movie
<START> it would appear that some previous reviewers may have had their expectations set a bit too high going into this film i found it <UNK> the satellite channels for something not knowing what and happened upon it i thought by the title it might be one of the <UNK> soft core porn flicks appearing regularly on the movie channels but i was pleasantly surprised although there was some male frontal nudity in fact more than your typical soft core title go figure this was not the focus of the film it was just fun br br don't be <UNK> by my tastes my recent <UNK> have included before night falls and europa europa both imho but i also enjoy total mental <UNK> when watching a movie virtual sexuality did this for me and that's not a bad thing
<START> i give it a 2 i <UNK> a 1 rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films we don't even remember what this movie was about the only thing we recall is one <UNK> scene where the actors drop to the ground roll to the other side of a <UNK> or something and then get back up shooting it was like watching 80 year olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the also when the characters were driving in a truck the engine noise or radio can't recall would <UNK> entirely when the actors were talking br br and like others we bought it because of the sandra <UNK> front cover very sad very bad
<START> the <UNK> unfolds in short shots and short scenes revealing its characters and message over time the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful simple score this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are br br the spare approach is also its <UNK> there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus <UNK> i'm glad i did because the actors' <UNK> of their motivations gave me a much more well rounded understanding of the film overall br br aside from the story itself it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies the shooting was very <UNK> done very matter of fact one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold not a <UNK> sleaze film the <UNK> of the <UNK> their <UNK> is a great contrast to the sometimes <UNK> nature of the plot br br not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time
<START> <UNK> banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside the inside counts for something too a lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls i see <UNK> less involved with the girls in every season about the only thing worth watching top model for is mr jay <UNK> recently <UNK> had a contestant who was a pre <UNK> <UNK> i felt that she should have done more to encourage her it was obvious that she had <UNK> about her original <UNK> showing through her feminine look <UNK> should have given her <UNK> or perhaps she could have sent resident ms jay to help the girl out instead the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism it's a shame because i truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons there's a reason why project <UNK> has all 4 seasons out on dvd and top model only has 1 season on dvd it's called taste top model seriously needs a lot of an some more humanity
<START> even mel gibson <UNK> save this <UNK> of a movie this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he <UNK> sit and watch what was this a total <UNK> on some heavy drugs stalking a lady who was also on some heavy street drugs for all the <UNK> out there on heavy drugs you will love this movie
<START> review <UNK> films they've been around since forever a few that pop to mind are the mexican devil <UNK> movie <UNK> night of the demons 2 the convent and of course <UNK> <UNK> cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious holy image and <UNK> it around to make it scary if done right it works here comes the most recent addition to the <UNK> sub genre simply titled the nun br br the story is about this group of girls that live in a catholic school in this school there's a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls the girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her br br this movie was produced by brian fantastic factory you know the company that makes horror movies in spain need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company <UNK> out well <UNK> a small reminder <UNK> darkness <UNK> the werewolf hunt <UNK> you get the picture about the only really good movie that this company has produced in my opinion was stuart <UNK> <UNK> thats it oh no wait i believe they also produced the excellent christian <UNK> vehicle the <UNK> but thats it so when i <UNK> rented this movie i knew i wasn't going to watch anything that was mind <UNK> good still with all that mental <UNK> i was disappointed br br one of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look the movie has some nice cinematography it doesn't look like a cheap horror film the movies special effects were alright with the nun being able to travel through water well that was an image that it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes <UNK> into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch i <UNK> that scene with the nun <UNK> herself at people like a bucket of water its not a particularly deadly move but it made for a cool visual there's some gore here but not a lot of it one particular scene involving an elevator death was cool but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene and it was only half way through after that nothing really cool happens and the movie <UNK> into an incredible <UNK> br br the movie just turns into the nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare she would kill someone and then cut we get back to the characters talking crap going through rooms opening doors you get the <UNK> and i just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that people opening doors and going into rooms boring and when the characters do talk its terrible dialog in one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her and everyone just says ok and they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank now who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted who the hell knows but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid br br and yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used spanish actors who have a very thick accent when they try to speak english its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated the fact that this dvd has no english subtitles didn't help matters either br br so in conclusion this is a movie that has some slick visuals nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script i guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with then you've still got a bad movie such was the case with the nun br br if you want to have some real fun with evil nuns rent any of the films i mentioned at the beginning of this review now as for the makers of this film they should go say ten <UNK> and light fifty <UNK> to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this terrible film br br rating 2 out of 5
<START> it's really just terrible quaid overacts more than shatner the part where elvis walks in and says you can have it all just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is drug use was completely snow <UNK> the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin quaid also looks nothing like lewis and has dark roots and <UNK> i wish this could be re made in the future with someone who doesn't try so hard a bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his actual life i was very very disappointed in quaid don't watch this movie or you will be too
<START> i think it definitely is the writing is of such a quality that <UNK> students of the english language should model their conversations after its dialogue for example the exchange between paul bronson and ms kathryn davis deborah <UNK> more about this character later is extremely clear and to the point ms davis says i hope you like chicken it's the only thing i know how to make to which <UNK> responds <UNK> good i like chicken if that's not english <UNK> 101 i don't know what is br br another thing about this ms davis character sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells him she wants to see him one last time this being only the fourth time they've ever met before she moves to her sister's house in ny to get away from the creeps then he really doesn't even bat an eye while her corpse is burning in the street only minutes later never even says her first name through the entirety of the film not once never a get over here <UNK> or a that's a nice dress you wearing kathryn or a be careful katie or the get ya br br and while this <UNK> is developing between the two <UNK> keeps his ever <UNK> eyes on them it's almost as if is using her as bait to get to much as he uses the camera or the car sure enough when bites bites back hard in the most incredible sequence of events ever caught on film the final fifteen or so minutes are possibly <UNK> only by the final thirty minutes of <UNK> force in their brilliance and that's giving <UNK> force a lot of credit in what other film can you see ed <UNK> take out alex winter in order to get charles <UNK> back a troubled gang leader seemingly calling a <UNK> to <UNK> neo nazi <UNK> to come to his aid and <UNK> broadway dancers wearing <UNK> <UNK> tops posing as street <UNK> all laid down to a soundtrack written by none other than jimmy page if that's not the highest of high comedy then nothing is funny br br <UNK> speaking there are a thousand ways to state the unintentional comedy of death wish 3 but the only way to truly understand it is to watch it and judge for yourself
<START> i'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie <UNK> kane i have about a 20 minutes to go if it gets any better i will come back here and let you know but somehow i doubt that will happen <UNK> kane looks like it is based on the video game dark watch and it sounds like it is based on the video game legacy of kane but unfortunately neither is true i hear it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that i have never heard of but whatever it is based on there is nothing original in this excruciatingly boring movie the atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300 which wasn't that great in the first place the tedious overacting takes itself so seriously that it's nearly hypnotic and to be clear i mean that in a bad way the plot is practically non existent violent guy trying to be meets friendly family friendly family is murdered violent guy becomes violent again all the characters are stereotypes taken from <UNK> or book of eli or the hills have eyes or whatever just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash <UNK> movie that you have seen and there you have it someone somewhere said this is how to make a movie use a blue <UNK> to make everything look mysterious add plenty of slow motion shots of horse <UNK> <UNK> in murky <UNK> add <UNK> around while two boring characters are speaking to each other and oh yes rain <UNK> down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening and don't forget the black <UNK> walking toward us with fire blazing behind them and lots of <UNK> burning and of course <UNK> fight scenes during which it's not clear what is actually happening because we don't have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal and oh by the way don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them relate to them or sympathize with them and cross fingers hope that fans of sword and <UNK> films will eat it up even though it is complete doo doo and go straight to video do not pass go
<START> this movie would had worked much better if this was the first <UNK> movie this is a low budget movie with only two 2 <UNK> shown on screen why this looks like a fail is because this is the last <UNK> movie and it's so low budget that it seems the director made the whole movie with his own pocket money however i did like this movie i compare it mostly with the third movie which were bad <UNK> 4 have a more serious tone in it the first half of the movie even without seeing one <UNK> yet you have a scary feeling watching it too bad they didn't milk out the <UNK> i mean even if they only had two 2 puppets they could still have used them on screen a lot more the <UNK> also have different deaths in this movie which made this a little special especially at the end with the frozen <UNK> <UNK> has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie which took me by surprise lastly i liked this one because it also has some kind of conclusion to the series so at least we won't see a <UNK> 5 anymore oh one last thing i missed one scene in this movie we never see a <UNK> shoot a spike from its back maybe these puppets didn't have that feature but i was very disappointed not seeing that in <UNK> 3 we see a lot of spike shooting which was the only good thing i liked about that movie
<START> real life husband and wife paul <UNK> and jennifer <UNK> star in creation which <UNK> the period of charles <UNK> life prior to the <UNK> of on the origin of species in <UNK> his infamous world changing <UNK> on evolution and natural selection <UNK> research created an enormous <UNK> a <UNK> between the <UNK> of his day and scientists he was said at the time to be going to war against god and even to have killed god br br the film revolves around <UNK> life with his wife and four children jennifer <UNK> is excellent as his extremely <UNK> and loving wife a revealing scene at the beginning when she leads the dinner table in <UNK> and charles fails to say <UNK> is <UNK> of what will follow and of the stark differences between the two she is convinced that he will be <UNK> damned and bring misfortune to their family by <UNK> god br br <UNK> is torn between his strong love for his wife her faith and his even stronger reason there are beautiful moments of him <UNK> animals <UNK> their <UNK> and the sequences that make up their lives explaining <UNK> of selection to his children the first born annie having a very morbid curiosity we see him <UNK> with <UNK> first <UNK> jenny playing with it as if it were a child <UNK> her every look and action br br annie the <UNK> child later dies and charles becomes haunted by her death having been closest to her in my opinion this part was too long bizarre and drawn out i did not like the <UNK> scenes where he seems to be losing his mind and is pursued by the ghost of his daughter shouting and <UNK> although charles thinks that his wife blames him for her fatal sickness she very <UNK> says the truth is if i knew then what i know now i would marry you tomorrow their bond is solid and <UNK> despite tremendous differences of belief br br when charles finishes his <UNK> he hands his wife the final copy telling her she can burn it if she does not agree she stays up reading it nights on end and finally presents him with a package the book ready to be sent to its <UNK> in the end reason and perhaps love as well triumph as he makes an <UNK> out of his <UNK> br br it is fascinating that <UNK> received a full christian burial at <UNK> proof that his ground breaking ideas were seen as controversial of course but were already then recognized as vital knowledge for the <UNK> of the human race br br the movie definitely draws heavily on <UNK> family life its <UNK> and its troubles i happened to like this aspect but <UNK> said it was like watching a documentary on i quote hitler's passion for <UNK> <UNK> this is true in some respects and i can't disagree with his desire to have learned more about charles <UNK> theories from this film than we do it remains nevertheless a well executed and acted period drama br br my rating 7 7 total score 14
<START> no that its sick it's not sick it made me want to <UNK> because i spent 2 dollars on it its boring retarded and annoying i didn't see the mst3k version which sucks because i bet the mst3k version was funny it's sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies i'm surprised its not on the 100 worst movies of all time list br br rating 0 outta stars
<START> how dare you adam low without apparent shame puts his name to this fake tribute it's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great <UNK> work yes it's long and <UNK> yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested on the subject have already seen but what the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the <UNK> the last and <UNK> voice comes from a third rate german actor <UNK> and raving the appropriately named mr low directed this hoping i imagine to get better ratings than his previous more to the point but deadly boring documentary on kurosawa well i have news for you mr low and your <UNK> you missed a great opportunity and i for one won't give you another
<START> seeing gary busey in a g rated film was a first and a nice one at that i don't know much about the director but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them where did <UNK> <UNK> come from my kids love her the only thing i remember christopher <UNK> doing was blue <UNK> disney needs to see this film and put him to work the wife thinks he is very cute i liked what he did with his character he seemed so real what we liked most was the message this film sends out greed sucks and faith love and family wins this is the first low budget dvd we've bought that had so much stuff on it the producers made this one for kids and the kids loved it they liked the music and all the extras on the dvd the director probably won't stick to family movies but i hope he does cause he really knows how to get the most out of kids animals and stars like gary busey the dog was great and seeing gary busey act like a dog was even funnier there wasn't much we didn't like about this one it hard to find a family film without all the crude humor and <UNK> was a delightful surprise
<START> this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his her mother in a crowded <UNK> full of people half her age <UNK> some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be hip in the <UNK> of that age to see ingrid bergman <UNK> to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch i was embarrassed br br to make matters worse the music in the disco was not realistic at all it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era the <UNK> music is <UNK> and bears only a painful passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60's br br <UNK> is hopelessly miscast as some kind of <UNK> man he just looks grotesque <UNK> wide eyed innocence is just too silly the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too <UNK> and seriously he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce painful pitiful mess
<START> jeff <UNK> is leslie <UNK> barbara laurence is vera hunter and john <UNK> is <UNK> along with some <UNK> air force <UNK> and a comic geek they are in charge of a super secret underground laboratory on the west coast <UNK> is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but <UNK> when the meteor decides to take a <UNK> in the pacific ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the mexican coast br br nobody knows what this <UNK> <UNK> structure is obviously it's some kind of <UNK> because it's all made up of right angles with a kind of bald <UNK> half visible on top br br it turns out that the machine dubbed <UNK> is from some far away planet and has been sent here to rob the earth of energy you see here on earth we have learned how to <UNK> matter into energy but on planet they have figured out the other half of the <UNK> how to <UNK> energy into matter and now they're running out of energy on the other planet are you taking notes on this good br br maybe you'll be able to fill me in on some of the scientific questions raised by mission for instance if <UNK> can <UNK> energy into matter and vice versa why don't they just <UNK> a little of their own spare matter into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to earth to <UNK> lights but it's <UNK> the writers could explain it either <UNK> the of two <UNK> is described as an <UNK> which means a towards human change which doesn't make sense but it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter the <UNK> that <UNK> draws on the board has the current going in the wrong direction from positive to negative br br there's a problem with too it <UNK> along the coast threatening populated areas read southern california but it has no <UNK> in its two or three legs these <UNK> just <UNK> slowly up and down <UNK> some people the film doesn't make much of these <UNK> people they're shown as mexican <UNK> so maybe they don't count for too much the <UNK> also drops a <UNK> bomb on <UNK> while it's in mexico mind you nobody raises an <UNK> br br not much acting is called for and not much is given jeff <UNK> has a distinct and <UNK> voice great for radio or for tv voice overs his face is less <UNK> he has only one expression no matter what the situation is a tight smile as if he's having his picture taken at the universal studios tour barbara laurence had a fine golden quality when she made street with no name a few years earlier she was a <UNK> <UNK> year old as richard <UNK> wife here her <UNK> and demeanor <UNK> her to the level of b movie actress though she's still beautiful it's always good to see morris in one of these movies he's made so many i get them mixed up br br on the whole the film comes across as flat i'm afraid there are some nice shots of a b <UNK> in flight though the sets reveal a low budget enterprise that's not necessarily bad in itself but there's nothing to make up for the <UNK> settings little tension in the script no directorial display and little effort put into the performances br br you might get a kick out of it a relaxed high because this is distinctly <UNK> it's just that there are so many better films of the genre out there
<START> the love letter is a somewhat pleasant very very low key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in a mysterious love letter <UNK> the secret passions and <UNK> of a sleepy sea side town's inhabitants br br it's not for all audiences the love letter i feel benefits from it's simple and quiet tone never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it's quaint <UNK> and <UNK> however for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and <UNK> br br the cast is nice it's great to see tom <UNK> again and is such an <UNK> role and it's hard to believe this is the same kate <UNK> we met 15 years ago in indiana jones and the temple of doom she's quite naturally good here <UNK> in every role i've seen her in since grating on nerves and is it possible <UNK> is just getting <UNK> and <UNK> with age what is it about that spielberg br br it doesn't amount to much but after another <UNK> summer movie season i'll probably look back with brief <UNK> for this light as a <UNK> romance
<START> okay let's cut to the chase there's no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10 and yet you have to see it the acting is bad but is nothing like as bad as the script which itself <UNK> before the production values cardboard <UNK> <UNK> we've got then car floor <UNK> painted silver and used as <UNK> here it is br br the film itself pretends to be artistic but is just cheap the same shots are used repeatedly especially in the drawn out fight scenes there is thankfully very little dialogue and there is much <UNK> music to ram home the horror br br and yet all this awfulness is compelling you have to watch it through just so that you can say you've seen it i've not even got onto the <UNK> sets the <UNK> or the <UNK> special effects this really is the <UNK> not to do <UNK> school of filmmaking this must be viewed spread the word and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the end br br the best thing though is that they made a sequel
<START> <UNK> seen this piece of perfection during the fantasy <UNK> in berlin and when i went out of the cinema i felt like being drugged down <UNK> seen a lot of films but there are just a few that <UNK> call perfect like <UNK> or fight club <UNK> cruelty is definitely one of them half of the people went out of the screening in berlin and i can understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and <UNK> a person that is living in his her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen s c and also thinks it¬¥s great just contact me so far i <UNK> met anyone who shares my opinion <UNK> be cool this film earns 10 points out of 10 finally <UNK> really sorry for my bad english <UNK> not a studied person <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gut so g
<START> i wasn't so impressed with this film finding it quite tiresome and plain the plot line was interesting a kid creating his own college and hundreds of kids but the laughs were few and far between the jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes the characters weren't intriguing and i didn't feel for any of them even the fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group it was a good first watch but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend comparing it to other films in the same genre ie american pie is just cruel because there is a film which was laugh a plenty this accepted failed to raise a smile
<START> i'm afraid i did not like this adaptation when i started watching it i had a strange feeling of watching some 70s tv series due to the <UNK> and the musical score i did not like the end scene mr appears dressed only in his jane austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a <UNK> coat looks like the producers made a modern <UNK> of a romantic girl's dream i appreciate the more modern <UNK> adaptations much more that show an eye for these details that makes the bbc series so worthwhile sorry looking forward to the 2007 adaptation i hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of jane austen adaptations
<START> i don't know why they even kept the name how they could call the series 'the scarlet after they <UNK> from the novels so much i wouldn't have a clue the character names are the only things they kept and even then they changed a few of those and mixed them up and changed <UNK> relationships with them admittedly i only watched about two hours at the most of it but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like <UNK> had portrayed her characters and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing poor lady i hope that when the next person wants to make a movie series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did
<START> when this film gets it right it really gets it right and when it goes wrong i'd say that a full 3 of the film is great i can even <UNK> the bad bit it's everything that has to do with the romance everything that you need to know about it is said in the first five minutes but it drags on for about 30 i'd recommend skipping that section if you can it does nothing except explain his <UNK> it should have been a minor plot point quickly thrust aside fortunately the period from about 0 30 and 1 00 2 19 the end is excellent br br there are a number of excellent performances in this film and an equal number of terrible ones just like everything else in this movie the acting is either perfect or terrible peter ustinov as the slimy one eyed slave is perfect it is one of his best performances up there with his role in <UNK> victor mature as the ambitious is also perfect again one of his best roles jean simmons is wasted as merit the perfect girl in love with our hero john carradine gives a nice supporting role as a philosophical grave <UNK> and michael <UNK> is excellent as the idealistic <UNK> who tries to bring peace and <UNK> to egypt only to see it fall apart due to his <UNK> to fight now for the bad edmund <UNK> as is sadly miscast this is <UNK> unfortunate as he is the main character the entire film revolves around him he actually does rather good as the <UNK> <UNK> and the wise old man this is because of his sorely limited range he doesn't seem able to put any passion into his words this is especially apparent during the love scenes which are beyond awkward he spends the last half of the film as an old man a performance at which he is decent enough at he does have the perfect voice for the character the less said about <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> woman the better br br the <UNK> and sets are magnificent this is the only film that i know of that attempts to depict life in egypt that isn't overshadowed by jews or <UNK> the film takes place in the <UNK> century b c which is before even <UNK> the only are the <UNK> and his followers there is the same strong element of religious <UNK> that can be found in most epics but it is done differently and it only shows up at the very end an interesting note by having followed by as <UNK> the film completely <UNK> over the most famous <UNK> of all seems kind of a strange thing to do when using that name could increase awareness of the film br br be warned this is a 1950s epic film if you don't like that type of thing then don't expect this one to be different it is different but it is still an epic i appreciate this film and i appreciate what it did and what it tried to do this is a film that should be better remembered than it is

<START> i saw this film at our <UNK> film festival and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in <UNK> and starred karen black i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never <UNK> and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they to portray how did lee and <UNK> become such deep friends in five minutes which of the two were f ing the girl under the tree it was unclear and there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south despite the awful this must be how they sound just <UNK> the r approach to dialogue so many times the actors <UNK> out of it altogether especially sounded like a new york street tough during emotional scenes and nobody sounded at all walt character was supposed to have been from morgan city <UNK> yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and <UNK> accents the other <UNK> point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual <UNK> inside him before i start a <UNK> here and am accused of <UNK> i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes notably <UNK> when love comes and b monkey but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men well <UNK> williams has already covered this ground and did a far better job of it so i wonder if the <UNK> brothers can get <UNK> accents and culture dead on in films set in <UNK> and in <UNK> why can't anyone else what a waste of my time
<START> i watched this film with my family over a long <UNK> holiday weekend i am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it though i didn't pay much attention until the end of the film when a head seems promised but alas doesn't happen br br on the other hand i watched this movie some years later and loved its <UNK> absurdity <UNK> and just plain fun i think that the film has a female tone women are not exploited in it even though i am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation i think the movie plays with <UNK> of the period br br i keep thinking someone ought to remake it and flesh out some of the <UNK> in the original
<START> it's about time for a female boxing flick but this one ain't it though the acting isn't too bad the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go to top it off the boxing scenes display zero tension come on how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting
<START> one of the worst movies ever made if you can get through this movies without falling asleep then you are doing pretty good considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the <UNK> are saying and if you can <UNK> see whats going on from the terrible film i mean hell if you cant find anything that works better use a home movie <UNK> at least you can <UNK> tell whats going on br br it is beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape on video and further more how do people making this not know how terrible it is good god br br after what i have just told you if you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie there is nothing to tell a group of <UNK> on <UNK> get lost in the woods and a bunch of people <UNK> them or <UNK> to that whats more so an action movie than a horror this <UNK> is of no interest if someone <UNK> likes this i feel for you br br absolute trash not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent <UNK> 9 from and have a ball
<START> i'm a horror movie freak and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen the <UNK> is totally original who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldn't be better some may find it disturbing but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie it also makes a good point the spiral symbol is kinda <UNK> the spiral <UNK> spiral <UNK> on <UNK> of all the <UNK> they could have used square triangle <UNK> this was one of the best choices if you can find this movie definitely see it it's certainly unique and quite unforgettable
<START> i saw this movie last night on hbo didn't expect to get hooked i usually fall asleep when i watch hbo but it happened you will too it's a tragic documentary 2002 oscar winner about a murder of an elderly female tourist in florida and subsequent investigation arrest trial of a 15 year old boy br br watch this movie today get a feel for how we have progressed as a society this film was most deserving of an <UNK> oscar you'll be moved to tears
<START> okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see actually there isn't a bit of in it it's <UNK> adolescent <UNK> idiotic and utterly hilarious basically <UNK> and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is <UNK> enough to stay have an all night drinking <UNK> with the boys from the power plant next door and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press give it a try if you're a fan of and and their work if you're not don't get the movie simple as that br br i'm not being thick this is a word from another one of <UNK> into the movie world
<START> somewhere in the dark <UNK> of my brain cells a song plays in my head i can't forget it no matter how hard i try it's midnight madness and it's gonna get to you wish i could find a copy of this on a record five <UNK> teams head out one night in l a for a <UNK> hunt for clues instead of physical objects an <UNK> game master with two gorgeous <UNK> is the mastermind of all this insanity that's about to be unleashed on l a all the teams are stereotypes this movie being from 1980 before political correctness screwed everything up the good guys the <UNK> led by eddie the dumb beer loving <UNK> the we don't need a man type ladies especially the <UNK> the <UNK> twins are a scream too and finally the bad guys with stephen <UNK> as the leader <UNK> is hilarious as the overweight <UNK> harold whose attempt to use a computer to <UNK> the various clues leads to a <UNK> mess movies like this aren't made anymore these days movies have to have an <UNK> to them with some dark characters and other nonsense go back to the days when the good guys led by david <UNK> were still good and not hopelessly conflicted so dump all serious <UNK> and go back to 1980 it's midnight madness
<START> i watched this movie with big expectations the <UNK> on the back <UNK> that this was going to be a nasty one but it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying the violence was nothing i haven't seen a thousand times before the gore level was only average mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in hollywood in the last 5 years perhaps more and at no stage was i even feeling uneasy let along frightened again a cat 3 movie with big <UNK> has not lived up to its hype br br sure hire this movie but don't go in with any expectations i am so keen to get into the whole asian horror scene but am continuously disappointed i did love <UNK> and audition but then again miike stands alone at the moment br br please inspire me there is a large <UNK> of jaded genre fans who are <UNK> of quality horror
<START> i can imagine why he'd want to die after starring in this rubbish the man is incredible but even sidney <UNK> couldn't save this tiresome morality play about racism in the old west he and joanna going are both fantastic in this film too bad the screenplay co stars directing and score couldn't match those two
<START> what can i say about a movie as bad as this the people who made this movie didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic you never see more than its head and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to <UNK> and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over i couldn't believe that when i first heard it and had to <UNK> several times to make it sink in other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy <UNK> attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle still it's watchable if you like this sort of trash i know i do
<START> this movie was terrible the acting was lame but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad this is one of johnny <UNK> worst movies i highly <UNK> anyone from watching it br br if you must see cry baby though i recommend <UNK> it and simply <UNK> at mr <UNK> for and hour and a half
<START> the bbc and hbo teamed up to create dirty war a 90 minute tv movie about a terrorist dirty bomb attack in london the film gets down to business quickly as it packs both the terrorist and the government anti terrorist efforts into the film leaving little room for human interest subplots on the terrorist side we follow the bomb from the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> on the government side we see <UNK> and training <UNK> intelligence gathering and analysis <UNK> post <UNK> response and follow up the film also <UNK> a sense of how al type terrorist cells are organized the radical <UNK> terrorist mentality and terrorist <UNK> a sort of <UNK> of a dirty bomb incident dirty war will answer many questions lurking in the minds of a public becoming ever more aware of this <UNK> threat b
<START> what if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot br br well i think it would probably end up a little bit like this one i don't think i've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed at the beginning to complete crap by the end i only stuck with it because i kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse well up until the very end graveyard of horror proved me wrong br br who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard man evil grave robbing <UNK> and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad one would think <UNK> at least be some humor value but not here
<START> director screenwriter allan burns seems to have <UNK> two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and <UNK> it results in a unfunny film christine plays a crass cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with <UNK> <UNK> mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family only to discover <UNK> husband ted <UNK> is <UNK> secret affair burns has a strange stop and start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective just increasingly annoying because nothing important ever seems to get said <UNK> thin moore looking <UNK> <UNK> in her <UNK> has a <UNK> smile but doesn't convince as wife and <UNK> gets stuck with a <UNK> <UNK> role he's just there to be a <UNK> the movie attempts to cover all the <UNK> in a classic case of <UNK> woman's role in the <UNK> the tv news <UNK> the cheating family man the working wife and mother who wants more a woman's need for female friendships et al but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half <UNK> <UNK> the issues as a writer he is surprisingly free of <UNK> but is devoid of a purpose as well and the heavy plotting just gets all <UNK> up 1 2 from
<START> mild spoilers but you probably know the plot br br woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind oh did i mention the rape victim was mute that s the problem with ms 45 the rape victim decides she s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this surely the whole film would have better if we had give a voice over as to why she s <UNK> off any man she comes across there s just not enough development to this plot br br as you d expect from a film by <UNK> it s not a complete waste of time it s far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo <UNK> will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as goes on a killing spree at the end but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and <UNK> any serious comment the film could have made
<START> i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content excellent acting <UNK> cole <UNK> i was sad about little space for <UNK> black though subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot considering the genre without a lot of logical holes really non predictable twists build up characters these are the greatest <UNK> of the movie combined with style some may consider this movie a b grade effort but i would disagree with that the whole thing really is very original and stylish br br and even though i'm not a fan of <UNK> <UNK> this tough guy role of <UNK> suited him well can't wait for chronicles of <UNK> it's really cool this <UNK> gonna have a sequel br br 9 10 if you ask me
<START> i saw this film in <UNK> in july it deals with the courage of czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the <UNK> after their country had been occupied by the nazis in this film the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political <UNK> in and during world war ii in britain they were imprisoned after their return to their <UNK> because the communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their <UNK> of the pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against nazi pilots this film contain a love sub plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to <UNK> democracy the end of this film <UNK> that the <UNK> of these czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the <UNK> of democracy in the country then known as this powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the czech government i highly recommend this film
<START> how this film could be classified as drama i have no idea if i were john voight and mary <UNK> i would be trying to <UNK> this from my <UNK> it was as historically accurate as <UNK> and <UNK> abraham and <UNK> got <UNK> into <UNK> lot <UNK> nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born <UNK> the earth really what were the <UNK> thinking was it just ignorance i remember something about <UNK> and animals and lot and and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even a <UNK> of taste would have <UNK> at this one
<START> this film starts with a pedestrian setup before <UNK> into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etc br br i couldn't say the acting was bad there were some good surprised faces by hamilton and sheen but then i really wouldn't have to br br <UNK> finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains still if my life was flashing before my eyes i think i would fast forward this 90 minutes br br i have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published yes very <UNK> suit that sheen wears i made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this bad again
<START> this is by far the worst non english horror movie i've ever seen the acting is wooden the dialogues are simply stupid and the story is totally <UNK> it's not even scary 2 out of 10 from me
<START> this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see it looks like some christian group made it to <UNK> people i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv br br it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci fi film from the 50s but quickly changed about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about god and do you believe in jesus it quickly moves into pure religion territory br br i thought i was going to a sci fi movie the film has poor acting bad camera angles and is amateurish br br avoid it
<START> is definitely a memorable entry in the swords and <UNK> category of movies i found along with quest for the mighty sword at a <UNK> shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2 00 each for them believable sets and costumes good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior <UNK> make this an enjoyable watch a few problems though there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit like the cave men for one i didn't understand their purpose also this movie could have really <UNK> from some more monsters the snake was cool but i guess it does borrow a little from conan however any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a is ok by me see <UNK> and battle for <UNK> i think <UNK> is cool oh and was anyone else reminded of by the villain or is it just me i give a 7 10
<START> beware my lovely <UNK> from a play written by mel who apparently liked writing about frightened women his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral <UNK> he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for <UNK> performances on broadway during the 1950 season it was only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy <UNK> and richard <UNK> br br the roles that <UNK> and <UNK> played are taken by <UNK> <UNK> and robert ryan for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference himself <UNK> his play for the screen so i'm wondering what he thought about that certainly the <UNK> issue was eliminated completely from the story br br that wasn't the only thing that was eliminated the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in i thought that strange and later on when the <UNK> company <UNK> comes to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era br br the film is almost entirely set within <UNK> <UNK> home where she's hired an <UNK> stranger in robert ryan as a <UNK> the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference it turns out that ryan is a <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> in her home for about a day br br both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy <UNK> would have overwhelmed a solid story
<START> when <UNK> pierre or the <UNK> hit <UNK> in <UNK> his first <UNK> since <UNK> dick a year earlier the public response was similar to that found among the imdb reviews of x <UNK> even published <UNK> like <UNK> insane which of course he wasn't but when one <UNK> the writing styles found in <UNK> dick and pierre one finds in the latter a sharp departure from the simple and often <UNK> style found in the former clearly he was <UNK> the overly <UNK> style of the now forgotten victorian romances that were easily his immortal <UNK> dick he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his <UNK> wanted and that surely would have sold his version of a victorian romance was a twisted cynical one perhaps but brilliant in its <UNK> the alternate title the <UNK> is quite appropriate as pierre <UNK> for and thinks he finds truth we become more and more uncertain what and whom to believe as he <UNK> for happiness he becomes more and more miserable br br x is a fascinating adaptation of this novel set in modern or nearly modern france though in some ways it leaves little to the imagination and shows us <UNK> the incestuous relations that <UNK> could only hint at the <UNK> which make the novel and its message so <UNK> are perfectly in <UNK> the questions it raises are ones that few films have thought to ask yet the answers are left to the viewer br br i recommend a reading of the novel which is much shorter than <UNK> dick before seeing this movie i hope more people discover this <UNK> film
<START> the <UNK> touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a century <UNK> the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially <UNK> <UNK> so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women don't let your girlfriend watch this movie
<START> i saw this at my local supermarket and i knew that debra was in it so i decided to buy it out of support for that sexy woman the plot and acting in this movie was terrible with the exception of debra wilson and i'm not just saying that because i love her she seriously was the only actor or actress who had any emotion in their acting and voice what i didn't get at the beginning is why the wife didn't just get back in her car instead of running at random like that it was so stupid and it's la nobody saw her being <UNK> on a public <UNK> street nobody yeah that's realistic also in the park when charlie stole the woman's cell phone for some stupid reason they were hell bent on finding him and at one point when they did they had him at <UNK> over a cell phone in reality i doubt the <UNK> would go out of their way like that for a stupid cell phone the lady could've walked up to one of many of those cell phone and have it replaced the kids acting skills sucked too i think they were reading from a cue card or had somebody off camera <UNK> their lines because they'd be asked questions and would look around and then answer in a questionable voice i e yes i do miss daddy also how could there be all of those <UNK> be in the trees and on building <UNK> in la without being seen i see this being played at 3 am on usa br br debra wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts she's the only actor with any real acting skills debra sweetheart stop doing these cheap d grade direct to video films maybe that'll change with the upcoming film she puts some jokes in there like when one of her superiors comes up and asks her who's she talking to she screams at her computer and goes <UNK> charlie i gave it a 4 10 a 4 only because of <UNK> good acting skills
<START> as an ex nuclear submarine officer i must admit this is my favorite submarine movie even <UNK> hunt for red october someone knew something about <UNK> when they wrote the movie ok not realistic but it is a comedy and has all of the inside jokes from the submarine force a great cast with the stereotypical uptight submarine guys on the orlando and our heroes on the <UNK> boat definitely by the way that means <UNK> <UNK> forever but they want ten lines in order to post this is the <UNK> in charge here br br line 10
<START> people who say that some of what the looney tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something they weren't originally intended for children they were produced for the cinema to be shown before feature films and so they could show anything that they wanted s o s has that bad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> finding <UNK> aboard an ocean liner and <UNK> the ship to try and get him but two things work against <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> protecting the <UNK> and <UNK> easily gets <UNK> we don't see him throwing up but with his green face they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that and then of course the seemingly cute <UNK> has a bad ass streak br br it's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out whatever they thought about showing they showed we need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children really funny
<START> this rubber monsters failed trying to be cool scary or even comedians looks like a wannabe movie of <UNK> or animals house but the sequences and history is not always clear also can't catch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad taste the only thing that's makes you laugh is the awful rubber monsters who must have a cost of one dollar each because the work or them never looks realistic the movements and expressions make looks the muppets as a pixar 3d movie when you compare with this hope marie <UNK> is the only thing that makes this awful movie and when she dies in the movie this turns even worst than before a movie who only must be seen in fast forward
<START> for those of you who like stand up comedians you must have heard about george <UNK> he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him br br but he died already god rest him in peace or hell he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity haha just joking don't take it serious br br it's bad for ya it's one of the latest works of george <UNK> before his death br br believe me one of his best works a must for any fan and an almost best of of all george <UNK> jokes it's not a best of but it's really amusing br br it has less political and religious jokes it's only to have a great time br br editing is very good it's not a concert so it shouldn't have quick changing of shots the slow <UNK> to other shot was well done <UNK> is the best option in terms of editing
<START> the english patient not only has it all doomed romance tragic war great characters but it has it in a way that no other movie does it is a tale told through flashbacks featuring amazing performances by all involved visuals characters we care about and the most <UNK> love story ever told a cinematic landmark the best film of 1996 and one of the very best of the 1990s
<START> a funny thing happened to me while watching <UNK> on the one hand the hero is a deaf mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does <UNK> <UNK> er excuse me corpses through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and <UNK> in his town and lurid where would we be in a 70s <UNK> without our gratuitous lesbian scene not to mention the romantic aspect oh how sweet miss it
<START> impressive vision indeed and some hot chicks with swords flying around oh and those hypnotic chinese <UNK> too let me think <UNK> tiger hidden dragon br br i kinda liked <UNK> with its down to earth simplicity and well developed characters that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the meaning of it br br hero on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and <UNK> the larger than life moral was horrible i mean sacrifice your life sacrifice your beliefs sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed wtf br br no thanks br br but <UNK> <UNK> and g w b would be proud br br <UNK>
<START> great book great movie great soundtrack frank sinatra shows in this movie that when he wanted to put the effort in he could act the ending is a bit <UNK> but for the time it's understandable the studio wanted a happy ending the graphic nature of the heroin addiction groundbreaking for the period is a plus add the terrific soundtrack and you've got one of the great american movies
<START> this is an embarrassing <UNK> <UNK> of the same plot in the <UNK> bunch of idiots young adult in peril because they are idiots slasher movie of the early millennium this time we get the story of a crazy <UNK> who comes back from the dead to <UNK> his gold from the hands of the we have almost no thrills almost no bare flesh even if the girls are really hot only one of them goes showing her bare ass for a few seconds the usual bunch of sunset <UNK> horror stars in cameo roles this time karen black richard lynch john philip law jeff <UNK> lots of fake blood only the crazy <UNK> <UNK> as a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck well not exactly to the screen till the end don't waste your time if you are not a <UNK>

<START> when become <UNK> they still exploit in the name of poverty br br my first reaction after seeing the movie is ¬ñ god bless me that i am not eating fish or any non <UNK> products br br the documentary is about lake victoria of where numerous <UNK> of lovely <UNK> used to live and one day during 1960s somebody came and <UNK> the mighty fish <UNK> who became the <UNK> for to european and japanese <UNK> the consequences were severe ¬ñ firstly all local small and big fish were <UNK> secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial business <UNK> sense so it is filled with arms and <UNK> that is what europe can give this world <UNK> the pilots as all <UNK> and traveling population like truck drivers has to survive their sexual needs by <UNK> cheap local african prostitutes for them <UNK> the <UNK> dealers middle men in the chain mainly indian origin business people get <UNK> and poverty remains the same fifth poverty drives the children to crime drugs etc br br the premise to make this documentary was excellent but has the director <UNK> succeeded in making a good documentary it is a big no br br i say the reasons like in india it requires a higher <UNK> to stand up and project to the world indian poverty and <UNK> similarly it requires an born european documentary maker to tell the world the story of and its <UNK> and ruining economy and poverty it is the pathetic motive of unaware <UNK> of that rich class who have never seen poverty or known poor who survives live earn and fame like <UNK> hanging on to <UNK> poverty to the world as soon as they see it there is nothing more but despise by poor people in african and india who see such images of their br br the intention and motives of the <UNK> seems totally <UNK> sided the images characters locales interviews are too grave and murky dark and disturbing he uses exaggerated ignorance as a voice to present his case what we feel in the end is pity and sadness for <UNK> we also start considering the government and people as villainous may be some <UNK> sitting in their air <UNK> rooms would find time to discuss and debate about the pathetic living conditions of <UNK> but there would be nothing more than that br br the director <UNK> to show himself even once on the screen ¬ñ so as not to be identified among the europeans who exploit this poor country br br this director <UNK> can only survive being themselves like today's <UNK> and media giants <UNK> did not have guts or common sense to talk to any europeans who eat or companies who <UNK> these fish products a totally <UNK> sided flimsy effort but i understand the reasons of the same ¬ñ <UNK> just wanted to <UNK> his fame sitting and smiling with awards in his european comfort br br no more words to spare for this pathetic effort i <UNK> give the documentary a higher rating 3 5 stars out of 10 just because the theme was correct but was <UNK> exploited and blown away by amateurish ill conceived director made solely for un intelligent western audiences stars 3 5 out of 10
<START> the premise is rather original and well thought of but unfortunately <UNK> a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects jeff <UNK> does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful linda hoffman they should make more movies together the movie while not worth much praise <UNK> at least one viewing
<START> story of a strange love and a fall desire poem about beauty and his perfection fear and touch a slice of visconti and mann and an <UNK> <UNK> know if it is a masterpiece a poem or the reflection of a film director's world it is absolutely a <UNK> <UNK> and a exploration of illusion a old mirror of limits signs and <UNK> <UNK> a trip in an old space nostalgic cruel and splendid death is a trip copy in the immediate reality and the essence is the music a soft sweet music like honey or <UNK> fire like every regret and every sorrow like a <UNK> in deep <UNK> <UNK> is gay by accident he is the <UNK> of last form of god's presence the beauty that beauty who gives life's sense who is sin and virtue in same time the gift of expectations and <UNK> he dies because he has right to hope to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way a victim no way only may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition
<START> an old high school teacher of mine used to <UNK> that he'd seen every movie ever made so one day a friend of mine and i decided to make up a movie called pacific <UNK> later we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by carl or billy dee williams our teacher found the argument interesting so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in pacific <UNK> was played by jim brown we thought he was trapped in a lie that was until we went to the library and discovered that pacific <UNK> was in fact a real movie this incident forced me to rent the movie it's horrible our made up movie had a better plot than this piece and billy dee would have been much better in the picture
<START> i know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great but i have to disagree br br sure it's a good book it was actually one of my favorites when i was little but it's just not meant for theaters maybe for a little half hour short but i don't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film br br it is a cute movie but i would only recommend it for really little kids older kids will have no interest it adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones but anyone ages 7 adult will have a <UNK> fest br br sorry if you disagree with me but this is my opinion
<START> it's a shame that such a lame plot should be hung on such <UNK> locations with some documentary style <UNK> shoved in for extra length a shorter film may have held the tension a little more and a more charismatic lead may not have <UNK> his lines so much the female lead also was not allowed to do enough resulting in a pretty but boring affair it builds towards the end but the lead actor's own redemption is too little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film not awful just a pity <UNK> but nice enough to grace tv <UNK> of the early hours
<START> what an incredible story and what a beautiful film <UNK> off to ben daniels and the great <UNK> de <UNK> this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so <UNK> i watched it <UNK> almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its <UNK> end this film's execution was almost flawless simple and pure it plays with our hearts <UNK> us in understanding the strange <UNK> absolute thus <UNK> bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world both are capable of affection yet ironically it's the more evolved one who becomes <UNK> and <UNK> unable to accept the other's freedom it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes br br only a <UNK> mind would associate this story with any kind of <UNK>
<START> you got to love this movie i mean what other swedish splatter movie could be so evil bizarre and totally cruel the whole movie is stuffed with some kind of weird humor like the old just blows his head off and the boss just <UNK> the blood off his glasses and says with a mean voice your fired
<START> robert <UNK> excels again the period was captured well and the soundtrack although hearing modern <UNK> in this period piece was a little <UNK> at first proved to be very well chosen br br well worth a watch
<START> not as bad as billy but close try as he might warren beatty just could not be believed as <UNK> whenever he <UNK> out instead of being shocked by the violence i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony the other actors don't fare as well either <UNK> <UNK> just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women she is better off with safe characters as many have noted joe <UNK> would have <UNK> better if the script had him as a more believable george raft only harvey keitel emerged <UNK> but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep and robert <UNK> with just one line steals one of the big beatty <UNK> scenes with these films i'm never sure if the director is intent on making the <UNK> seem like normal <UNK> or if it just comes out that way either way i don't like it these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> i don't think that a movie should be made <UNK> the guy especially one with a big studio backing
<START> the famous <UNK> of their breakfast meat <UNK> with <UNK> still is recorded by fire in my <UNK> or the wind filling the right places of the <UNK> the fog better than carpenter's the fog <UNK> is the real terror <UNK> out from human history instead of pirates ghosts but i tell <UNK> something not even the magnificent scene in performed by brian <UNK> palma with the excellent music of <UNK> <UNK> in the filmed in slow motion can equal the effect of the original masterpiece of the crowd climbing down the <UNK> we see not merely the baby but i remember the hand of a baby stepped by boot someone with no feet escaping at the last minute someone wearing glasses then a cut edition and then the same glasses broken by a bullet that passed through mini stories in a single scene
<START> i've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world it took me 3 efforts to watch this movie the first time i fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom possibly because i was already tired as it was late at night the second effort i managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again i found myself asleep i can go on and on like this but i think you're getting the point nothing happens ever in this movie a complete waste of time and money this movie really sucks watch it and you will know what i am talking about if you can get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all then you are indeed a <UNK> the only reason i gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option i just thought the world needed to be warned before either hiring or worse yet buying this trash later
<START> very memorable comedy it's fun to watch the many situations develop and finally <UNK> after a long journey on that greatest collection of <UNK> humanity and the world's largest <UNK> <UNK> the great american <UNK> like mad mad world it's got loads of contemporary talent old boy politics good comedic action and dialog unlike that one it is the target that seeks not the <UNK> <UNK> they have no idea what they really want as they drift along america's great road nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly laugh but the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing humor and timing and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular the total <UNK> of the city <UNK> in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling the slapstick is funny but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed all in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are good or bad and the goofy situations we find ourselves in it was just meant to be funny and it is
<START> what a great movie it's a touching story about four high school friends who grow up in the 1960s throughout the decade the friends are somewhat separated but they to see each other occasionally there are many <UNK> but there are also a lot of happy moments that make you laugh and smile it's a heart filled tale of life love and friendship definitely a must see for drama fans

<START> since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one i'll start with the following 1 i voted awful for this dreadful so called movie br br 2 let me explain why these <UNK> mr david produces are shot mainly in my beautiful <UNK> <UNK> just in btw for the illiterate people around this country is in europe based north to <UNK> and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and <UNK> some years ago <UNK> image has <UNK> our country and started making crappy mostly direct to video releases why here because here they pay <UNK> low <UNK> to the <UNK> crew and to the <UNK> actors most of them distinguished ones which are in many ways better than most of their american colleagues personally i am ashamed of that fact the reason is of course the of the americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit actually it <UNK> be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years at present <UNK> image is being <UNK> here over the very <UNK> <UNK> of our national cinema production centre called films no doubt about it there has been corruption there has been <UNK> there has been a lies in this recent purchase the <UNK> cinema is dead long live the <UNK> cinema
<START> i have been feeling a little disappointed by tarantino ever since death proof but i insist it was only a little because i can appreciate the amount of work in producing such an homage to stunts people <UNK> <UNK> has definitely <UNK> tarantino to the top ranks in my universe this movie can be summed up albeit <UNK> in one word raw br br there is an intense emotion in every scene revenge and justice seem to be the main themes from the start of the movie one feels compassion towards the victims of the nazis and is placed in <UNK> fictional dimension of the ww2 historical context br br characters are fun scary brutal sexy and other <UNK> i am sure are escaping my mind that are just as fitting and positive i won't go in to an appreciation of each character but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances br br dialogue has evolved from the classic tarantino bad ass provocative style as seen in pulp fiction and death proof one can feel in the dialogues that tarantino is making more open references to other movies indeed many dialogues were near lessons in cinema to the audience the setting partly takes place at a movie premiere a reference to a movie is close around every corner br br it is nice to see that each language presented german french and english is employed rather equally and naturally i speak both french and english very <UNK> and am frequently disappointed in how english speaking characters in french movies act poorly and how french speaking characters in english american movies act poorly amazingly enough tarantino managed to make his actors pull off a natural and <UNK> performance from his actors it helps put the audience in context of the historical context indeed soldiers spies and rarely understood soldiers spies civilians from other countries br br the visuals photography are beautiful with <UNK> convincingly conveying a 1940s wwii europe the outfits are perfect and the violence realistically conveyed no punches are held back and the nazis are often shown being tortured this makes the movie not open to all audiences the graphic violence can shock the more sensitive <UNK> br br volumes can be written about this movie but the movie is so good that during the north american <UNK> <UNK> premiere at the <UNK> festival in <UNK> i had to pee but refused to go so as to not miss one single scene i hope that image conveys how strongly i feel about this movie and i'm a hard audience to please
<START> this movie doesn't even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good it is truly appalling its closer to a tongue in cheek parody than a disaster movie but alas they were serious made for tv but not worthy of even that it contains every clich√© and cheesy plot moment you can imagine oh will he save the town from the <UNK> will his wife admit that she still loves him will they escape before the <UNK> <UNK> them i cant explain how bad this is awful predictable plot that makes you <UNK> it is so cheesy bad effects although to be fair i have seen worse super <UNK> <UNK> water bad script <UNK> acting hideous so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it
<START> this is a <UNK> <UNK> short a miller dressed in white makes his way towards us from a <UNK> in a desolate landscape although the image is <UNK> down there is an obvious logic here however he is stopped by the <UNK> all in black because of his work they start each other for no particular reason did the <UNK> miller insult the <UNK> <UNK> is this class war br br whatever he <UNK> his <UNK> with <UNK> of grain which fly all over the fight making redundant everything he had done prior to the fight making redundant the <UNK> so that all becomes as pointless as the fight the <UNK> grain the <UNK> later westerns wouldn't be so subtle heroes and villains being colour <UNK> is there a racial <UNK> here br br if this wasn't marvellous enough the fighters are chased off the screen by a crowd of people who came from nowhere an appropriately <UNK> ending to an odd story or are they just the social conscience rising up against a fight that <UNK> order and purpose and very unusual in the days of early silent cinema this mix of comedy <UNK> and the absurd is an obvious <UNK> for buster keaton while the <UNK> reminds us of one of the great thrillers hitchcock's <UNK>
<START> sam <UNK> the film editor on the <UNK> suspense flick rosemary's baby from 1968 here directs a <UNK> tv made sequel one in which <UNK> <UNK> patty duke <UNK> in for <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> off early and inexplicably presumably to help flesh out the more <UNK> aspects of this <UNK> story about <UNK> son on earth most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar winning role as <UNK> with ray <UNK> well cast as her husband roman but she isn't given much to do and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway this script is strictly low rent goods and must have <UNK> original author ira <UNK> who went on to write his own sequel fairly dim and <UNK> with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever
<START> there are just so many things wrong with this movie br br jeff bridges weird accent br br <UNK> ability to crack the <UNK> code br br the entire script br br the ending <UNK> the last scene when two <UNK> are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the <UNK> j r laugh and say we don t drink coffee anymore well why did they order it then they obviously did if they didn't and the <UNK> brought everyone a coffee by <UNK> there would have been three <UNK> br br total <UNK>
<START> perhaps once in a generation a film comes along that is perfection for me the <UNK> children is that film a timeless classic that was directed and performed most beautifully it depicts all that is worthwhile in humanity and <UNK> in the conquest of love and faith over cruel injustice every performance is a gem though <UNK> stands out and like judy garland as dorothy before her jenny <UNK> makes it impossible for us to imagine anyone else in the role br br the world is all the better for this film and the children of today would be much the better for watching it br br of course like so many young men of my generation i fell hopelessly in love with jenny <UNK> and her hold was as strong when i had the great good fortune to meet her a few days ago the <UNK> smile and voice like dripping honey were still there to send me weak at the knees as they first did all those years ago
<START> i love this movie so much it always makes me cry if you appreciate drew barrymore half as much as i do you'll love this movie it's got all the <UNK> i look for in a movie it has good actors good characters good humor a lot of heart warming moments too the flash back moments when we see <UNK> in high school make me cry though every single time i'm sure you'll like this one don't judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie even though it is in a way a teen movie sure if you're a guy and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time then this isn't for you but if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it pick it up at a video store and enjoy drew barrymore is great in this one
<START> i tell you although it is funny how how this many swear words are in this one i'm sure the number of <UNK> and swear words in it would probably count up to about 200 because from what i last heard the greatest number of swear words on a south park episode is <UNK> counts of the word s t but aside from that its so funny because in it there is swear words and also shooting themselves in the head watch this for your own survival also look out for a mention of <UNK> father and also the annoying voice of chris and also kyle has to save <UNK> from the catch a predator show is also on <UNK> and they track a down and when they got there the shot himself
<START> with a cast like this i knew the acting would be amazing still i was <UNK> as i always am of sequels would it sustain the feeling of the first film could they possibly <UNK> the tension and thrill of the masterful heist of <UNK> 11 we'll never know because they didn't try at least not in the way i expected instead they made a light and truly funny parody of the heist genre if you want a gripping logical heist don't watch this if you want a good laugh with witty dialogue quirky characters and an absolutely genius scene where julia roberts has to <UNK> herself then you'll love <UNK> 12
<START> man what an awful film as with many terrible films the structure of its awfulness lies in the script this is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name okay here's one major problem sandra <UNK> character is <UNK> by jeff bridges in his car at a busy <UNK> store in broad daylight somehow her boyfriend <UNK> sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her <UNK> come on personally i find this completely insulting to even the of audience members yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense of equal frustration is the poorly explained motive for jeff actions his character is a bit of an eccentric academic to be sure but far from the <UNK> who would do these things he goes through about ten minutes give or take <UNK> his <UNK> to sutherland as to why he has performed his cruel actions but the explanation itself lacks even the most <UNK> sense of logic therefore no intelligent audience member can really believe in the possibility of his evil and if you <UNK> that element from the story the entire thing falls apart br br also of major concern jeff bridges using a weird pseudo french accent for no reason br br the entire boring subplot involving nancy travis most especially her saving the day by turning the tables on bridges br br the crazy woman who somehow manages to remember jeff <UNK> license plate number despite also thinking that the lucky charms <UNK> is real br br sandra <UNK> character's name diane conveniently re <UNK> to form the word <UNK> are you <UNK> kidding me the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in a very remote location a human being within the span of forty minutes as bridges specifically <UNK> to br br this is a movie that made me remember the fictional <UNK> stupid yet very successful donald kaufman character in adaptation many screenwriters are brilliant inspired artists some are just <UNK> who convince the <UNK> running the studios to make their drivel this particular script is so stunningly <UNK> that donald kaufman himself would have managed to sell it unfortunately for all of us in the real world todd <UNK> actually did
<START> everyone agrees about the technical excellence of this film by <UNK> whose life ended short so <UNK> as for the content of course it makes a difference if you're a and this explains some of the <UNK> of opinions for me it is to cinema what <UNK> pays <UNK> <UNK> un pays is to song in addition jean was himself a part of legendary <UNK> br br this film can be <UNK> with crazy a current <UNK> release that is successful enough to be showing here in spain and is also about the 1960s urban <UNK> crazy vs rural <UNK> <UNK> but also a film that must be something very different for <UNK> and for people who know <UNK> from the inside
<START> the worst part of all is the poor scripting leading to superficial acting br br <UNK> character is intensely repetitive and annoying and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match br br holly <UNK> character is <UNK> self centered and hunter herself <UNK> in serious overacting as usual br br brad johnson was wooden john goodman made the best of it br br furthermore the whole death ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone and now appears rather lame br br barely watchable only if you like old
<START> leave ed wood alone to call plan 9 from outer space the worst film ever made would be to deny this <UNK> vulgar heap of hollywood <UNK> its <UNK> title this pretentious <UNK> of witless <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> commentary actually does seem to be formed along the lines of plan 9 with badly staged scenes of down on their luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes <UNK> from higher budget epics but whereas plan 9 occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall this tacky <UNK> is <UNK> lacking in basic <UNK> with scenes ranging from <UNK> unfunny the disgusting <UNK> of <UNK> marx stealing manhattan from the indians to low camp hedy <UNK> attempting to <UNK> joan of arc hearing her voices to tedious dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of <UNK> to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic <UNK> give the worst director <UNK> to irwin allen for turning so much into so little
<START> sadly this movie is <UNK> to status it seems many people that i've asked did you know the <UNK> made a movie usually answer <UNK> ' that being said if you are one of that large number i recommend you see it but with the following <UNK> s if you expect monkey style humor it is in there it's just not all over the place like the tv shows br br yes they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by <UNK> fun at it like a bunch of no longer teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks br br no you don't have to be <UNK> to enjoy it br br no you don't have to be <UNK> to understand it br br if you like classics you'll love the interspersed clips throughout br br if you like the psychedelic era you'll love some of the cameos br br if you are a <UNK> fan you might recognize some of the <UNK> they are taking at the heavy <UNK> of the band br br in the <UNK> immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing 5 minutes of it this is a weird movie man in fact it might be better if you don't try to understand it just sit back and react to it it's weird it's funny it's a bit surreal it's experimental still it is many things overall it is an experience
<START> on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into <UNK> george <UNK> american <UNK> we have <UNK> high an adaptation of sorts by one eric <UNK> co creator of the popular 1970's cbs sitcom good times br br <UNK> high was and is viewed as a black version of american <UNK> instead of central california as in american <UNK> we have the black <UNK> of <UNK> green as the backdrop for the story here instead of america in <UNK> <UNK> high is <UNK> in 1964 the movie stars welcome back lawrence hilton <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters it has <UNK> morris playing the principal who tries to keep and <UNK> characters named and <UNK> out of trouble a great deal of the time br br you know i would like to say that <UNK> high is a worthy comparison piece to american <UNK> or that it is a great film on its' own but i can't the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad <UNK> of black life in america having the film in the green part of chicago doesn't help things br br neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here when is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet when the gang visits the chicago <UNK> one of the gang named has <UNK> thrown on him by an ape when the <UNK> character <UNK> is being chased by two <UNK> in the school <UNK> a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is <UNK> herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom the high school the homes of the characters the <UNK> just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban <UNK> and poverty br br if that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film the use of violence and profanity in the film <UNK> high may be an coming of age film but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american <UNK> so much br br <UNK> records had a hand in making the film the <UNK> music was part of the film's soundtrack but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music of that time period was more than just <UNK> especially in chicago the song <UNK> the end of the movie by the g c cameron was not all that impressive there have been better <UNK> <UNK> that have been done by better <UNK> artists than cameron without question br br the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film <UNK> high aimed to be american <UNK> it shows that <UNK> an intelligent but <UNK> student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer eric <UNK> may have <UNK> himself as <UNK> character the last shot of film show's <UNK> running away from funeral held on a dark rainy afternoon and all the <UNK> that <UNK> high came to represent eric <UNK> through <UNK> and that final scene had one little lesson for all of us when watching <UNK> high and for the love of the past don't look back
<START> it's embarrassing i had like 3 minutes on my way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and i was really intrigued by the half <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> br br i guess this film shows what the new york film school and sir <UNK> fortune judging by the bio of this clown in the lead can do for you and you and you cause that's about what we have here and in addition a <UNK> <UNK> of the lead actor with someone else's body in a still image that doesn't happen anywhere in the movie it's weird cause in so many ways it had money thrown at it obviously low budget money <UNK> but from the outset when all the extras are laughing in their scene of terror it doesn't <UNK> well would have maybe had some charm if it had been done for 2 cents in short order i <UNK> scenes and fast <UNK> to see the image on the box that was all i really cared about strange why don't i just rent a porno or something but wow there is bad acting that's funny i guess and bad acting that's just bad robert englund is pretty pathetic in this along with everyone else it does make you appreciate the more not so straight to video horror that's out there blah most of which i wouldn't bother with <UNK> watched uh <UNK> 3 if i wanted to see an 8 pack i would imagine horny old gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the principle <UNK> of this and they ought to start a class action suit
<START> so this is where <UNK> head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start eh yeah it's none other than mr jules white who is credited or is it rather exposed as the director of this entry into <UNK> <UNK> series given co credit as co director is one <UNK> myers whose name is <UNK> unknown to us mr meyers was no doubt the guy who controlled the four <UNK> <UNK> and was responsible for training and acting in short he must have been the dog <UNK> on the set br br the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year the big house which starred <UNK> morris wallace <UNK> robert <UNK> and a stellar cast in support we must <UNK> ignorance in regards to this title not having seen it up to this point sorry <UNK> but there are many of the <UNK> gags that relate to what we've read about the movie not to mention some particular character specific gags for example we observed a <UNK> convict who st st <UNK> and <UNK> correctly that the bow wow actor was <UNK> character comedian <UNK> <UNK> we later cross checked with the cast of the big house and <UNK> his name is there brilliant <UNK> one fit for holmes watson br br the practice of <UNK> popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short it was one that seemed to draw no <UNK> from the producers and <UNK> owners of the major films but rather quite <UNK> received <UNK> of <UNK> after all imitation is said to be the <UNK> form of <UNK> besides any producer would welcome even some seemingly <UNK> <UNK> as for the movie itself we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner seeing so many of man's best friends being so <UNK> animated into one long and boring sort of <UNK> gag seemed very <UNK> to we who make up the audience i mean just how many were made to <UNK> needlessly in order to achieve the illusion of br br when it comes to pets or animal companions as the politically correct crowd prefers we are quite <UNK> <UNK> not only dogs but also cats and we don't enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non funny extended play format br br as incredible as it may seem the step that mr jules white made from <UNK> shorts to heading up <UNK> 2 <UNK> production would seem to have been not only a <UNK> up in the area of <UNK> but al o in the <UNK> content we never thought that being producer director for the likes of such <UNK> as the 3 stooges andy clyde and hugh herbert as well as some who certainly had seen better days such as <UNK> chase buster keaton and harry <UNK> would be a step up <UNK> br br in case we haven't made our point yet we're officially <UNK> this one so view it at your own risk we warned you br br note we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel hardy send up <UNK> us hal roach mgm 1931 in both mr laurel mr hardy by john <UNK> <UNK> and the films of laurel hardy by william k <UNK> 1967 both books have our most enthusiastic <UNK> br br note the prison picture became a genre of its own all <UNK> a debt to the big house in <UNK> us laurel hardy hal roach and its director did a first class spoof the first of many for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come
<START> one of the worse surfing movies i've ever seen this movie is so bad i don't know where to begin okay let's start with the premise some dude from the <UNK> who barely knows how to surf travels to hawaii and enters a big wave contest which he more or less expects to win a good <UNK> for those who don't surf would be a that of a grossly overweight chain <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> of running shoes and entering the la marathon with expectations of winning no way and the contest is held on the north shore which <UNK> up images of 15 foot waves but contest day the waves are maybe 6 foot the acting what acting if you must see this <UNK> see it on tv don't waste your money renting it if you want to see a pretty good surfing movie granted it is flawed but that's another story rent big <UNK>
<START> this movie is true action at its finest it doesn't get any better then this this is one of those movies that you can just kick back and watch some real good non stop shooting and killing plus there are some excellent lines to go along with all of this my favorite is there is a one bad guy who is breaking into this old couples home and he is stealing a tv or something and he goes right up to them and yells i will come in here anytime i like and right before he jumps out the window he yells anytime i mean this is just classic stuff all the way around so you got a choice you can watch that crappy will smith try to go an action film or you can watch one of the masters charles bronson
<START> to <UNK> this film involves two actors caine and <UNK> trying to con a gangster the plot is flimsy at best as several plot holes occur throughout however this normally shouldn't matter as the comedy should carry a film like this there are some genuinely funny bits mostly provided by dylan <UNK> however other times there are long melodramatic scenes that fail to add anything to the movie <UNK> character seemed overdone to me especially at the start he continually quotes shakespeare and acts like a pompous actor one could say he was playing the part properly but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny overall i would say see only if a fan of the actors involved otherwise wait for video or tv
<START> how can so many <UNK> decisions can be made all that waste of resources its an idiotic story to begin with but <UNK> no need to make it worse a loose interpretation are you kidding it <UNK> my regard for voight and coburn i hope they were paid well
<START> i love this movie one of my all time favorites this was the first big screen movie my mom took me to see when i was 9 i highly recommend it to every african american this story is about love trust challenges and everyday life of a black family all the actors worked well together i wish it was on video but as of yet it is not available that i know of i caught it on television a few years ago and recorded it so whenever i get the urge to watch it i have it the soundtrack is awesome too a must see
<START> i think that it's great how <UNK> picked up this series and showing it for this generation film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch <UNK> shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th the series nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time i am happy the <UNK> channel shows it in their line up i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up
<START> there was some good build up of suspense throughout the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget we witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly <UNK> by some quite cheesy lines understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you silence would have been golden here there could have been a bigger play on suspense than <UNK> <UNK> i sat in the <UNK> for fear of my brother something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty croc you decide throughout the film i can't seem to find a connection or for that matter sympathy with the characters perhaps thats because they don't develop one throughout the film character that is there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile <UNK> up on the characters overshadowed again by some questionable scenes in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated <UNK> corpse and only worry about a broken finger a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic
<START> ok i am a sucker i loved it i had no expectations and had them all <UNK> it was a terrible movie i loved it i have managed to wear out a dvd from over use no one can understand my obsession i can't either to tell the truth for those who have seen the movie this will come as no surprise but i asked the clerk at the video store if i could buy a copy and i could because there were two in stock and only one had been check out and over half of the time it had been to me br br now the movie is terrible the special effects are terrible the acting is terrible but i loved it the actors are silly the plot silly the goofs numerous like being able to see through the monsters the looked like they were made out of plastic garbage <UNK> maybe they were there was light underground <UNK> wasn't <UNK> etc br br you must really love b movies to get any enjoyment out of this alcohol helps enormously for others
<START> this was an attempt toward a romantic comedy and one which did not work although the film was cast in an interesting manner the dismal script betrayed the best efforts of all the director's <UNK> mannerisms may have succeeded if he had adopted a point of view it was embarrassing to watch william baldwin and in particular <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> four stories about the drug trade in europe become <UNK> over the course of this 6 part miniseries in germany a businessman is arrested on drug <UNK> charges and his wife attempts to save her family by continuing her husband's illegal trade meanwhile the british home secretary travels to <UNK> to <UNK> an aid package that he hopes will stop the drug flow from that country even as he does this however his own daughter <UNK> to heroin addiction <UNK> their family apart this is the miniseries on which the american film and miniseries were based the original is far superior to its two the poverty and desperation of the third world are portrayed very well it is stark <UNK> and brutal
<START> i am not understanding why people are <UNK> this movie i didn't like it at all i watch it with several people none of them cared for it either first of all it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story the actual filming looks like a live tv interview the makeup is bad when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who <UNK> in it there is no talent there are facts that do appear in the book the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one it has always fascinated me the bad acting really ruined the story the little boys situation really <UNK> it up even more when you watch this movie the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about it didn't make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her it is a <UNK> tale with him and his little problem i can't still get over the little girl saying mom said <UNK> will <UNK> your teeth frank <UNK> statement and facial expression is so bad the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho also the girl <UNK> over the bed and her little <UNK> control problem are from the exorcist this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a <UNK> i also noticed that their was <UNK> in the film quality parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs this is probably how this movie was put together someone said i like this story i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer doesn't matter if we don't know how to act as long as we get it on film and say it is good we got the family together and prepared food then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie
<START> what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film br br <UNK> one of the most important <UNK> and women of the <UNK> century had a fascinating and dramatic life what possessed anyone to make this film which explains her unique artistic vision as being the result of an imaginary affair with a grotesque yet charismatic hairy freak played by downey br br in real life <UNK> broke out of a traditional marriage and woman's role to express herself in this movie <UNK> is an ultra dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a beauty and the beast devotion to an interesting man br br for this <UNK> the film is truly shameful independent of that it is also just dopey and dull
<START> an on screen <UNK> informs us that it is 'the <UNK> sea may a small <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at sea containing six <UNK> from a <UNK> prison ship and the <UNK> doctor a lt claude de ross <UNK> <UNK> it's night a strange current takes the boat towards a strange <UNK> and <UNK> island the boat hits some rocks and is torn apart one of the prisoners is killed by what appears to be a slimy mutant fish man creature the next morning morning claude wakes up to find himself washed upon a beach he finds a pool of white <UNK> water and one of the prisoners dead beside it claude warns another surviving prisoner jose franco not to drink the water as it will kill him they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and skip <UNK> <UNK> wanders off on his own to try and catch an animal for food he finds and kills a large water bird but in turn he is killed himself by one of the fish men claude jose peter and skip continue to explore the island as they put death down to an animal attack of some sort soon after skip is killed when he is <UNK> on a spike at the bottom of a pit now only claude jose and peter are left they stumble across a cemetery with lots of empty graves and signs of recent black magic <UNK> claude spots a snake on a nearby rock suddenly a shot is heard and the snakes head explodes a woman on <UNK> named amanda marvin barbara bach is revealed to be <UNK> she tells them to leave the island immediately as it is owned by a edmund richard johnson and he doesn't like <UNK> claude jose and peter decide to carry on regardless eventually finding <UNK> large house in which they are invited to stay that night peter goes after amanda and tries to rape her in a swamp peter quickly becomes food for the fish men and a voodoo <UNK> called <UNK> cunningham who lives with performs a black magic ritual involving <UNK> the throat of a chicken at the cemetery the next day claude and jose decide they should leave the island as they feel very uneasy about and think he is lying to them jose rides off on <UNK> and is lost claude is saved from one of the fish men by amanda and is again told to leave claude wants to confront again reveals that he has a scientist and <UNK> father named professor ernest marvin joseph <UNK> who he needs to be kept alive says that the longer ernest stays alive the chances of his own survival will dramatically increase tells claude his plan has found the lost city of atlantis at a depth of over 2 000 feet he is using the fish men as a means of getting at the lost <UNK> of atlantis and needs amanda and her father to control them he claims the fish men are <UNK> of the original inhabitants of atlantis offers claude a share of the treasure if he will help him keep ernest alive later claude remembers the name ernest marvin as a scientist who was condemned for experiments <UNK> animal organs into human beings finding <UNK> secret laboratory he discovers had <UNK> to him and the fish men aren't <UNK> their actually <UNK> altered people turned into <UNK> creatures by <UNK> grotesque experiments has finally had enough of claude and decides to put an end to his <UNK> by sticking him in a large tank and slowly filling it with water as the islands <UNK> starts to <UNK> and send <UNK> flying everywhere wants to leave the island with his <UNK> and amanda will claude escape almost certain death to save amanda and get off the island before the <UNK> <UNK> tears it apart directed by sergio martino i really liked this film that mixes various genres the script by sergio <UNK> is fast paced interesting and entertaining the plot is revealed bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it all the way through i must say at this point that i've seen the original version and not the one with added scenes inserted for it's us release by roger corman barbara bach makes for an extremely attractive leading lady but i hated the way she was introduced by shooting a snakes head off i thought it was more than a little <UNK> richard johnson makes a great villain and <UNK> <UNK> a likable hero the fish men themselves look a little fake when the camera <UNK> on them too long but their cool looking and i've seen worse some of the <UNK> effects look a little poor too but overall again i've again seen a lot worse there's no real gore violence or nudity in it but that didn't really bother me actually the photography by <UNK> and the production design by <UNK> combine to create a very nice looking film period costumes props and sets like <UNK> house and <UNK> lab with it's old scientific equipment the lush green jungle settings also add to the visual <UNK> on show i really liked this film and i was entertained throughout it's running time i'm not sure who i'd recommend it too as it mixes various genres i guess someone who maybe <UNK> something a little bit different and generally well made if you can find a copy give it a go i'm glad i did
<START> i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on br br so imagine my delight when i discovered love suicide while <UNK> netflix <UNK> heavenly creatures an easy choice to the top of my <UNK> it went br br i watched it last made myself <UNK> and waited what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school <UNK> prank film project i laughed out loud once or twice thinking that just <UNK> the bar of straight to video turned out to be the movie horrible acting amateur direction weak dialog i usually enjoy low budget films there is something <UNK> and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the meat acting the direction the plot the story i would <UNK> it to a student who hasn't studied for an <UNK> goes in knowing he is going to fail and just puts his head on the desk and sleeps br br in someone else's hands the plot would have serious potential br br do not expect magic or even a cult classics like say <UNK> or <UNK> at least there you learn to expect bad acting br br love suicide went from bad to worse to the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new 2007 version of bridge to after i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again i must say that i was extremely disappointed i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying i know daddy but i hurt so much inside after leslie dies it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion i watched in <UNK> all the while saying no wonder they remade it the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of
<START> this film should be seen by as many people as possible as it concentrates on the human rights problems in <UNK> when i first watched this film in the mid 1990's it totally changed my life i knew very little about san or her democracy movement it <UNK> me so i wanted to understand more about the situation any film that has the power to make you want to learn more has done its job properly patricia arquette is superb as the american lady who due to personal tragedy has become reckless with her own life decisions and gets caught up in the ensuing conflict it is a powerful film about a subject matter which deserves more publicity as the film itself says the 1988 massacre of pro democracy <UNK> was not <UNK> and therefore largely went <UNK> to the world i <UNK> everyone reading these comments to take the time to find out more about the current plight of the <UNK> people br br it is about time this film was released on dvd can anything be done
<START> <UNK> features a top notch cast of wonderful actors who <UNK> been assembled for the perfect drawing room comedy alas they are pretty much wasted on a <UNK> <UNK> and a paper thin one at that <UNK> hepburn is indeed <UNK> as a <UNK> old maid who finally marries but her husband is deeply disturbed and <UNK> dark family secrets director <UNK> minnelli has absolutely no idea how to <UNK> this outlandish plot <UNK> by edward from a story by thelma and the friendly first rate cast including robert taylor robert mitchum and edmund <UNK> is left <UNK> in murky waters from
<START> the best thing i can say about the american version is that jane turner and gina <UNK> must be <UNK> in the money for this crap yes the american rip off was shown for about two episodes in australia but didn't rate probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be answer <UNK> a complete waste of time the actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the australian written script bad luck for them as they are doomed to <UNK> with this turkey my advice to usa viewers is don't br br americans should be best advised to find dvd's of the original version on ebay but be aware that some dvds are in a different to those <UNK> in the usa otherwise some dvd players will operate <UNK> from both all <UNK>
<START> those <UNK> words were spoken by william <UNK> as a war reporter to the <UNK> jennifer jones as a <UNK> doctor explaining his failing marriage on the beach they start an affair despite huge odds of adultery and racial issues in hollywood of the 1950s <UNK> romance was allowed but only with dire consequences at the end beautiful hong kong scenery although some beach scenes look studio bound a famous title tune poetic script lovely background music by alfred newman great costumes outstanding performances especially jones directed here by henry king who also did the song of <UNK> 1943 an oscar for jones still make this a world class romance <UNK>
<START> i remember that hey hey fuss i saw the jackson <UNK> it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit but i saw this it is free is out in the clear have i missed something if the black community should be complaining about any racist comments in a tv show it should be this if you've read my earlier comments i am not the easy to offend guy the basic plot is that an african american moves in next to this white guy they make these racist comments like the value of a house will drop just because of black <UNK> the white guy makes references like if your easily offended by racial <UNK> do not read on <UNK> jungle boy i <UNK> but that really happens in this show i really am a guy who is fine with the black community people might say hey <UNK> up but even when you take the racial away it is un funny no new jokes badly acted i can swear in one episode i saw someone's eyes focus on something <UNK> with the situation all in all horrible comedy
<START> had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called half empty i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel or prequel that hollywood throws at us this was different and surprisingly ¬ñ so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising when my husband and i go the movies we go to be entertained ¬ñ and half empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it it is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom it is almost like an <UNK> that particular scene reminded me of a scene in phantom of the opera when 4 of the performers did not just i e they sang against one another in a friendly <UNK> i am not a film <UNK> but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately it is silly funny entertaining and amusing completely enjoyable ¬ñ which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like half empty
<START> thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless i think jason is being judged like that by most people simply because he has a famous father maybe he's not as great as some of those actors but he's definitely not as bad as suggested br br i watched the movie some years ago and i actually loved it i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of <UNK> but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on it was really good br br during the movie i actually forgot he was the son of sean who br br and if you're a shakespeare lover i can recommend this movie i'm sure you'll enjoy it
<START> i mean let's face it all you have to do in <UNK> is pose for photos the judging is so over the top with it's criticism the show however is entertaining especially with <UNK> banks <UNK> barker j alexander and the <UNK> herself <UNK> i've watched season 5 6 7 and in the middle of season 8 it looks like american idol gone sexy but i'm a guy and i only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their <UNK> the show can be quite boring when it comes to judging <UNK> tends to go on and on and it's really off putting anyway would i recommend it yes would i recommend it to women wanting to go into the <UNK> business no
<START> being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit br br it was an awful film though the story was similar to the games plot the whole super human soldiers thing other than that jack <UNK> an all american man in the game is played by a unless thats some sort of twisted irony that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is <UNK> for because the game is set in the <UNK> rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forest br br this is a note to all directors if you ever plan to make a film based on a game book play it understand it and ask fans about it don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it
<START> you get this stupid excuse of a child's play rip off man what were they thinking first they mess with a <UNK> horror movie then they make crap like this tale <UNK> well to be honest i've seen this as a kid and it scared me a bit a lot simply because i was under aged with the <UNK> that <UNK> wouldn't do that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but i've grown and come to think of this as child's play rip a fairy tale bashing nonsense and a lame tales from the crypt episode or trying to be one at least with a lame ending that was stupid and it had many plot holes and i still can't understand how it came to life was it the work of an evil then what after a few evil deeds he becomes a real boy who becomes america's most wanted personally i think the concept of an evil sounds better he builds an army of wooden killers and starts a crime wave funny but this is awful awful awful awful awful awful <UNK> like a shoe and awful it sucked it sucked if you want killer puppets settle for the killer doll specifically child's play instead no strings attached or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down watch <UNK> or if you want <UNK> watch the animated version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin <UNK> instead 10 10 negative 10
<START> ok if you are a fan of mystery science theater 3000 and love to mock movies then you will have a lot of fun with this otherwise it may really be too painful to see br br plot obsessed <UNK> a huge <UNK> containing a onto a cruise ship apparently not having to <UNK> it at customs or even mention that he's bringing aboard a live animal no really it's research equipment the air holes are just an accident some he hired to it open the <UNK> <UNK> he paid <UNK> of money maybe there's something to steal once the wood <UNK> is open the breaks through the steel bars inside and goes on a killing rampage br br yeah whatever br br by a stroke of sheer coincidence a marshall i assume a u s marshall since he was in the <UNK> war not just some guy named marshall is on board investigating some money that went missing from the <UNK> safe he's posing as an insurance salesman lady i'm the best insurance you've got other <UNK> characters include the captain john rhys davies and sadly his dignity is the first victim of the film his <UNK> bo <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> bo an annoying old stuck up lady with a tiny dog which should be fed to a cat guess what eats it and an incredibly unpleasant <UNK> who might have been believable in a movie made in 1964 not in anything more recent much of the acting was really bad and the characters were just there so that you can laugh hysterically when they died br br overall <UNK> bad bad on many levels bad bad bad what bullets don't even make <UNK> but the <UNK> bo bimbo can punch him and scare him away hey sci fi channel you desperate for scripts or what
<START> soul plane is a horrible attempt at comedy that only should appeal people with thick <UNK> <UNK> eyes and <UNK> <UNK> br br the plot is not only incoherent but also non existent acting is mostly sub sub par with a gang of highly moronic and dreadful characters thrown in for bad measure jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a bit amusing this movie lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have seemed old even in the fifties the only thing it really has going for it is some pretty ladies but really if you want that you can rent something from the adult section ok br br i can hardly see anything here to recommend since you'll probably have a lot a better and <UNK> time chasing rats with a <UNK> or <UNK> or whatever br br 2 10
<START> i saw last night and i'm of two minds on the film br br on one hand i appreciate it for being the total of a michael bay film no dialogue extremely stylized grainy b w photography some of the most genuinely horrific imagery ever set to film and a very compelling use of sound which nobody else seems to have really picked up on yet it's a reflection on a theme and it <UNK> go where most filmmakers do not not only in terms of images but of production and concept it's a movie that most people don't understand and if you read through these comments you'll find a lot of people whose lack of ability to figure this film out results in them <UNK> about with the <UNK> of a <UNK> the bars of its cage at feeding time it genuinely shocked and disturbed me and the last time a film managed to do that was a while ago br br on the other this is a thirty minute short that <UNK> out to over an hour and a half i understand that there might be artistic merit in using <UNK> and <UNK> pacing as a <UNK> but in this case it just doesn't help everything hang together imagine being approached by a <UNK> man on the street who you by the shoulders and says something that completely <UNK> the core of your being but then instead of leaving your <UNK> and <UNK> in his wake he just keeps talking and talking and talking by the end of the movie i found myself <UNK> at my watch now and again br br this is not entertainment people this is this is how you people who just watched <UNK> if you watch movies to be entertained this will <UNK> <UNK> and possibly anger you you don't approach like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good you approach it like something on the menu you have never heard of before something you see <UNK> <UNK> of through the kitchen door something that's dark and and <UNK> on its <UNK> something you order not because it will taste good but because you just have to know what it's like
<START> ed wood rides again the fact that this movie was made should give any young br br aspiring film maker hope any screenplay you might have thought of using to br br line a or a <UNK> should now not seem that bad do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> watching this br br movie made me realize that <UNK> vs python was not that bad after all it probably would have been better to do this movie in <UNK> as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film it is understandable why this director has so many <UNK> there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of <UNK> then you can eat your way out of the <UNK> of cheese that <UNK> you <UNK> you to br br make your toward your tv <UNK> <UNK> of cheese that <UNK> it
<START> i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the <UNK> <UNK> any minute so i cheated grabbed the remote and was <UNK> to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes i should have turned the channel cute it had potential but <UNK>
<START> it's just when a band <UNK> and only has one original member it's not the same as the classic line up all new actors playing the main roles of <UNK> <UNK> etc with <UNK> as virtually the only returning face from the first movie and he was of only minor note of the first flick serving as the only <UNK> group of the three guys that <UNK> was trying to assist in meeting females the film is poorly written featuring the dumbest dialog this side of <UNK> even for a t a movie this one is a turkey not even die hard low budget 80's films fans would want to sit through this movie which has no plot and plenty of bad acting this film would have been better off never being released just plain bad
<START> if you're a film student or were one or are thinking of becoming one the name <UNK> <UNK> has or will have a <UNK> <UNK> like other silent film <UNK> like griffith although <UNK> <UNK> are not as <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> has had such an impact on the history of cinema it's of course taken for granted the reason i bring up the film student part is because at some point whether you'd like it or not your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the <UNK> stairs sequence of this film it's hard to say if it's even the <UNK> part of the film's several sequences dealing with the at the time current times of the russian revolution but it does leave the most impact and it can be seen in many films <UNK> suspense or just plain montage the climax comes to mind br br montage which was not just knack but also his life's blood early in his career is often <UNK> in the present cinema or if not <UNK> then in an <UNK> context for the story sometimes montage is used now as just another device to get from point a to point b montage was something else for <UNK> he was trying to communicate in the most direct way that he could the urgency the passion s and the ultimate <UNK> that were in the russian people at the time and place even if one doesn't see all of <UNK> narrative or traditional <UNK> ideas to have much <UNK> kubrick has said this one can't deny the power of seeing the ships arriving at the harbor the people on the stairs and the soldiers coming at them every which way with guns some may find it hard to believe this was done in the <UNK> it has that power like the passion of joan of arc to over pass its time and remain in importance if only in terms of technique and emotion br br of course one could go on for books which have been written hundreds of times over not the least of which by <UNK> himself on the film in and of itself <UNK> <UNK> is really more like a <UNK> <UNK> than a specific story in a movie the first segment is also one of the great sequences in film as a <UNK> is plotted against the captain and other head ups of a certain ship this is detailed almost in a manipulative way but somehow extremely effective montage is used here as well but in <UNK> of energy that capture the eye other times <UNK> is more content to just let the images speak for themselves as the soldiers grow weary without food and water he isn't one of those directors who will try to get all sides to the story he is of course very much early 20th century russian but he is nothing else but honest with how he sees his themes and style and that is what wins over in the end br br some may want to check it outside of film school as the sequence is like one of those <UNK> of severe tragedy on film displaying the ugly side of revolution <UNK> may not be one of the more silent film directors but if montage detail in the frame non actors and <UNK> themes are your cup of tea it's truly one of the must sees of a lifetime
<START> i saw this film at the boston festival of women's cinema last night and was <UNK> to hear ms tell us in her q a after the screening that she doesn't expect to see too much us distribution due to her <UNK> on including all of the so called gay content it was a fantastically entertaining comedy and it just seems to me that american audiences might enjoy it in much the same way they enjoyed the full monty so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a few shots of two boys kissing is keeping it away from mainstream theaters wonderful cast fabulous script and of course rose direction make this one of the funniest films i've seen
<START> is a great show i first saw it when i was 10 years old at the time and after school i rushed home and turned on comedy central i saw a cartoon called and i loved it it's such a funny and cool show it's created by <UNK> <UNK> who are great creators of cartoons they animated some of my favorite shows ever like the simpsons and <UNK> br br i've seen lots of episodes of this show and i think they're all really funny and sweet the voice actors did a great job <UNK> the characters too br br i wish that comedy central could bring this show back along with the critic and <UNK> br br but this is a great comedy central show great job <UNK> <UNK>
<START> young <UNK> wood and joseph are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to take care of their mother and how they cope when their new <UNK> begins beating the younger boy the supporting cast around the boys is top notch as well the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks but that's nothing new in hollywood that's honestly my only criticism of the film
<START> this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison <UNK> patrick stewart and co br br i really wanted this film to be good really really i'm a huge fan of princess <UNK> and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films <UNK> well crafted plots 3 dimensional characters and the best film music since well ever this film just doesn't come close br br might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the <UNK> species <UNK> can also <UNK> some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films and the english voice acting is quite well done br br but this film just isn't good the characters are all cardboard from <UNK> sweet little <UNK> to the <UNK> evil <UNK> to everyone in between once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds you've seen all there is and the fact that the plot just <UNK> along doesn't help br br then there's the music now <UNK> is hands down my favorite film composer but <UNK> doesn't do him justice half the music is 80's <UNK> on <UNK> and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it <UNK> the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that <UNK> was told to <UNK> a lot of the music before he even saw the picture br br but wait there's a great message with this film right let's all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a <UNK> there is a scene in which <UNK> <UNK> a tree no really i ain't kidding br br it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on that's lame br br if you're the kind of person who <UNK> anime enjoys 80's music and plants a tree every <UNK> day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
<START> the major flaw in this spanish slasher shocker is within it's script for the first half hour it's an okay effort building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread we even get some nice killings too then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole <UNK> of your basic slasher clich√©s i must admit that i was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more the final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent it should have been so much better although the final scenes in the <UNK> room is quite okay br br first of all we have the dialog it's awful most of the time there was quite a few <UNK> in the audience here and there when i saw it and merely adequate elsewhere it is also barely <UNK> during a lot of scenes drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to there is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the i know what you did last summer movies <UNK> that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke but i doubt it br br and the ending well some will hate it others will dig it for me it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere if the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status i might have thought otherwise it also throws all logic out of the window because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills but as an avid horror fan i have learned to live with these inconsistencies in spanish and italian movies br br but all is not bad the movie has a big budget appearance mainly due to the excellent cinematography the scenes from past times really shines here tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack even though most of the actors are pretty bad anita is an exception making the most of what she has to work with real screen presence br br and like i mentioned before the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water but the water theme tends to get tiresome in the end though br br so to end this review it's a movie that is quite fun in a so bad it's good kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will judging from trailer and plot <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> children at least this 1970 movie version written and directed by that long time british character actor lionel <UNK> is an <UNK> classic it tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm the sentimentality is muted the <UNK> of childhood adventures is involving and <UNK> brings <UNK> and style to his production br br the <UNK> family is leading an <UNK> life in <UNK> london the father is <UNK> the mother is beautiful and loving the children are well mannered and <UNK> their home is warm and <UNK> then one night during the christmas holidays two men appear at the <UNK> talk quietly to the father and then take him away in a moment the lives of mrs <UNK> <UNK> sheridan and <UNK> 14 jenny <UNK> <UNK> 12 sally <UNK> and young peter gary warren have been changed only their <UNK> and good spirits are going to see them through now <UNK> into poverty mrs <UNK> takes her children to live in a <UNK> old brick house in the countryside near a <UNK> line not too far from a small village with a train station the children discover the <UNK> and regularly sit on a small hill to wave at the passengers as the train <UNK> by one day an old gentleman going to his business in the city looks up from his newspaper and finds himself waving back it's not long before he will play an important part in the story br br as time passes mrs <UNK> brings all her love and intelligence to bear on her children she begins to write stories to earn money she teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them the story however is about these three children especially <UNK> at 14 she is old enough to want to share her mother's <UNK> yet young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother they find a poor man at the station who cannot speak english they discover he is a russian <UNK> who no longer knows where his wife and child are they insist he must come home with them and their mother takes him in before long the children have written a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train asking for his help they help a young man taking part in a who breaks his leg in a train tunnel soon he is at their home <UNK> they decide to have a birthday party for the station master a man with few friends and several children who is a <UNK> for his dignity it's not long before the children help him realize the difference between friendship and charity in other words the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be <UNK> in seeing that all the problems have happy endings br br but what of their own problems <UNK> finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away because he had been accused of <UNK> of giving state secrets to the russians will <UNK> be able to find a way to help will the old gentleman be something more than simply an old gentleman on a passing train will their father's case be <UNK> will there be a happy ending br br jenny <UNK> was almost 18 when she filmed her part she plays the 14 year old <UNK> with great <UNK> and charm as important as the other players are especially <UNK> sheridan as the mother <UNK> is the heart of the story for me it is jenny talent and lionel style and restraint that make this movie so memorable the story's problems come with no serious doubt but that they will be solved and <UNK> does not just give us an expertly adapted and directed movie he adds touches that are barely noticed but which charm us this might include just a split second of a freeze frame as two people talk or a slow close up of a small yellow in the grass outside home then a slow pull back from a yellow oil <UNK> being turned up inside or the realization that a delightful interior shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill all suddenly recall those charming <UNK> hand <UNK> drawings of a perfect by gone time br br perhaps this gentle story can't compete for the time kids need nowadays to perfect their <UNK> monster skills i'm almost positive it would never capture the attention of most of their parents especially those <UNK> on batman and <UNK> still it's a perfectly put together movie and shouldn't be forgotten as an aside 19 years later the story was <UNK> as a television program this time jenny <UNK> played the mother
<START> i first saw this movie as a younger child my sister had told me about it and i thought it would be more of a kid's movie however it remains to also be an incredible movie true that the subject behind the movie is <UNK> but also true this movie will never stop touching your heart br br i was only 6 when i first saw it and just yesterday 7 years later i saw it again for the first time in a long time even after i knew how it ended i knew that i had seen it a billion times i <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> little baby when i saw it a few years back i finally got the idea and the seriousness of the film so i <UNK> watching it for a while but yesterday i didn't change the channel i watched it by the end i was <UNK> at how much it still made me laugh cry think and above all believe in again i haven't in a long time and this movie got me out of my shell and opened up my heart this movie wasn't just <UNK> i was also so impressed with the actors especially bobby so if you are wanting to see this movie for the first time i suggest seeing it alone with <UNK> and being ready to discover your young sweet innocent side and the side that still has hope this movie touched my soul when i was only 6 and even in this time of trying to figure out who i am this movie helped me realize both what i don't and still do want to be in life
<START> this is a serious film about black <UNK> and not really an action film billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands it's fairly gritty and realistic without <UNK> the characters but still it's not that interesting either and billy <UNK> character though by white authority figures doesn't really come off as sympathetic it's also hurt by it's extremely low budget still it's interesting to look at as it's a good of 1970s social issues
<START> wow the curse of michael myers what a great film suspenseful entertaining creative and a clever plot which i love many hate the concept i love it i think that it gives the halloween series some plot <UNK> <UNK> is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance especially for her first film and paul rudd and donald <UNK> are great also my only complaint is that why wasn't <UNK> harris in this film as jamie she wanted to return but the producers said no i thought j c <UNK> was great but i love <UNK> harris still i love halloween the curse of michael myers i think the mask looks the best in this film and george p <UNK> is the best michael myers ever incredibly creepy and suspenseful halloween 6 rules br br i adore this very violent but immensely enjoyable film the halloween horror series by far the best in the genre br br 10 out of 10
<START> this is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap nothing is scary here and the film is almost <UNK> yes there is some violence but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie this is not a completely bad picture i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable however a lack of the originality really hurts voodoo all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo horror movies like scream are your favourite then you'll love voodoo but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film
<START> i don't expect a lot from ghost stories but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers when the bad guy all of the sudden becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of <UNK> start <UNK> him then i have a problem spending 9 00 for a ticket alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave didn't anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class a good movie has at its roots an interesting story br br here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of no where in north <UNK> to grow i kid you not if your <UNK> has serious <UNK> problems from a car accident move away from some of the best <UNK> and speech <UNK> in the country to an isolated small town which at best has a community hospital hire a drifter to live work with you out of the blue without checking any references when you have a teenage <UNK> daughter a wife and <UNK> i'm glad they're not my parents br br a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide just outside of town and of course blame the man's <UNK> on a bad crop of doesn't anything else grow in north <UNK> a couple of days after you buy your <UNK> house with huge <UNK> growing everywhere that it reminds you of jack and the a guy from the x files ala smoking man i'm glad to see the <UNK> didn't get him i guess he doesn't <UNK> will just suddenly sneak up on you while you're working to offer you the sale price of your home plus 15 more for absolutely no reason br br i think you get the picture i have seen so many <UNK> awful movies in the past month it just blows my mind is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot i'm glad at least the <UNK> in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains i wish i could say the same for <UNK> thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash
<START> for me it's a case you'll never understand if you didn't live it so read this to know why would i have such <UNK> anger br br i heard a lot about bruce lee my father loved him my mother who hates any minor shot of violence loved him and how she talks till now about his the big boss aka <UNK> of fury and the experience of watching it at the egyptian movies 1973 with all the gigantic success further to that i watched a real good movie about him dragon the bruce lee story 1993 so i found myself crying where are your movies bruce br br i went to the video store and it was dumb move you'll know why and <UNK> i found a lot of bruce lee movies i selected one named bruce lee in new guinea br br i did it to myself and watched that one oh god please forgive your servant i <UNK> myself but with no intended decision i wouldn't do it if i knew its evil <UNK> its mythical level of <UNK> br br after that i didn't understand at all what's the big fuss about bruce lee as a great immortal star why anybody would care whether he is here or there this hero whom i've watched is not that gifted and not that genius and of course is not that sexy br br until my father saw this star and he asked me to pause at any of his close ups and after he examined his face a little he told me in a very definitive way this is not bruce lee so i became too confused to ask who's this silly guy anyway br br it was 2001 2 years after my first entry to the imdb <UNK> therefore i tended to it immediately to know who the hell is that man and i discovered the truth he isn't bruce lee no my dear friends he is bruce li br br and what a huge so huge difference i just want to know who can love that bad clone or god <UNK> love his repulsive movies i watched 2 of them and couldn't bear finishing the third br br after that i ignored all our video stores because its cheap cunning writing on the posters that this is bruce lee and i've got the original the one and only bruce lee who is such a great star indeed and oh boy he certainly had the right to <UNK> and no less
<START> one of the funniest movies made in recent years good characterization plot and exceptional chemistry make this one a classic
<START> hmmm is it worst film ever well sort of for some of the cast its a shame to see them in such a film but hey if it pays the bills why not as for the film well ok cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film music is just about ok again for a cheap film end credits are ok lol br br bad to many to list but cast acting sets script ending what the hell <UNK> worst <UNK> ever many more but can not be bothered to put them all down br br idea was ok but needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points i do say however to see this film so you to can say what the fu was that all about as the credits run also its kind of a must see just to see how bad it is
<START> my friend <UNK> rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store i still feel ripped off since i won't ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back having watched the first dark <UNK> the night prior to this viewing i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film wrong br br there isn't a single scarecrow in the movie unless you count the one of the cover of the box nor are there any real death scenes the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god d n at her father br br there is no amount of <UNK> that could make this movie bearable believe me we tried
<START> that's all i can really say about this film it's like tree of might and the world's strongest it really doesn't fit into the <UNK> for the show at all though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series the action is pretty nice in general the plot has a nice enough base with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all pretty good in general there the problem is there's a lot of really weird stuff i mean really weird stuff like the world's strongest there's a really really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced <UNK> disturbing is the fact that while singing is pretty much drugged out himself creepy the villains are odd and rather comical <UNK> than the usual type this seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie in general its entertaining enough but just strange
<START> this must be one of <UNK> and frank <UNK> worst films an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing <UNK> he's no <UNK> and doesn't kiss he does play the nerdy character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak the scene are j <UNK> <UNK> and mildred <UNK> too bad they didn't have more scenes together i've given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by grayson love is where you find it is sensational could have had a of that one also a comic type dance number by <UNK> <UNK> and ann miller if fun so for those reasons and those reasons only it is watchable kissing <UNK> is part of the frank sinatra early years collection
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was a russian born animator living in france who did incredible things using stop motion i've seen a couple of these films before and they feature his favorite subjects insects <UNK> and various animals they are extremely realistic and <UNK> and even today are amazing to watch the quality is simply fantastic br br this one stars lots and lots of <UNK> they appeal to their god <UNK> to give them a king why do they need a king wonders <UNK> their lives are perfectly fine now so to teach them a nasty lesson he makes an the king and one by one it starts eating its subjects then the <UNK> once again appeal to <UNK> who states the obvious moral that it's best to be happy with what you have br br while the animation quality is incredible this is a very creepy film for kids i would think this would <UNK> them both by how real the animals look as well as the story itself which is not for the faint of heart
<START> our family and friends enjoyed this movie very much the theme was well handled by the director with great performances from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and well supported by good performances from the other cast the climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called good we are still trying to understand what was the director trying to convey were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers a better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and <UNK> the viewer ship this however should not take away credit that is due to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> for relating so well with the characters
<START> <UNK> all br br isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing br br i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film i couldn't stop talking about to all my friends for weeks mind you i was a very <UNK> 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then br br then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought right i'll <UNK> you off the shelf when they bring out the special edition br br last week i was <UNK> when my best friend invited me over to watch on dvd the expectation was that i would love this film even more on 2nd viewing how wrong i was br br verdict after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which <UNK> on the religious and supernatural side of things <UNK> br br i have never been a big fan of julia <UNK> acting <UNK> for <UNK> in which she deserved her oscar i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential and just a couple of <UNK> cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all not even the score by james howard who i rather like as a film composer could <UNK> and thrill me br br in 1990 i would have given this film 9 5 10 but in 2001 i'd be lucky to give it 2 10 at best br br
<START> the filmmakers neglected to connect the <UNK> that is the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti soviet to al <UNK> and <UNK> bin laden and eventually to 9 11 the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back story why were the <UNK> in afghanistan but that <UNK> <UNK> in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for <UNK> in afghanistan in the name of <UNK> anti communism ultimately <UNK> the hand of anti western forces and was a big <UNK> factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today 9 11 terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in afghanistan etc because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr wilson hey check out his latest projects on the internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole
<START> <UNK> not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of <UNK> but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original only set in present time it tells the story of <UNK> a member of a crime <UNK> in melbourne he is a <UNK> hit man and in the favor of leader <UNK> but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that and plan the murder of <UNK> and any competition of the throne this is a story of betrayal and cold brutal death br br comments very interesting idea i must say to use the story but change the setting to present time but still keep the original dialog it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence promised to be extremely violent it is a promise that it keeps but not in the notion i imagined it is very bloody indeed but the violence is slow not just <UNK> speaking that it is <UNK> which it is too but also literally a lot of action is actually <UNK> down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees br br what could have been a unique strength the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence now turns into something else entirely now both slow the move down painfully much so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times br br also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie apparently it does but to me it seems completely out of place not a subplot but a complete sub story with it's own rules completely different than the rest of the movie seems completely out of place surely it must have been possible to <UNK> that part too to something modern drug induced hallucinations perhaps which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again br br a clear disappointment but maybe something for shakespearean buffs br br 4 10
<START> since growing up in <UNK> i was following history of <UNK> pilots and <UNK> in wwii great britain their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist <UNK> and camps this is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history although the fact that those brave men we're able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing to all people who want to see great movie this is the one during recent visit of czech republic i saw this movie three times in three days they we're just playing it for three days otherwise i will go to see it even few more times it's worth of it i hope you will enjoy it although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story pretty much same way that the movie <UNK> was it's not a simple movie because of it's deep story and the way its told will most likely make you crying it did to me three times in row <UNK> <UNK> did as always a great script his son jan made a great movie and the cast without doubt all of them did great job i was amazed by <UNK> by great role played by <UNK> and all other actors which made this movie simply great if this is not an oscar nomination i think that i will be on strike in
<START> <UNK> <UNK> helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category and rather obviously so so it needs a lot of help br br the beginning holds a lot more promise of a film that could turn into michael <UNK> or stranger than fiction it's too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning then like the opening soundtrack it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere br br it's fun enough with plenty of and interesting characters acted well i'm sure that will be enough for many people the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which ironically is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization not the film itself it's not a self aware film but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty
<START> i've seen this film so many times it's that good maybe because i can relate to way of life is the reason why not everyone would find it to their taste also my is <UNK> after each viewing am i a sad case <UNK> mr i look forward to your next film although i did not see the film at a cinema i have the dvd and would encourage anyone to buy it the special feature extras alone is worth the price the amount of time a director spends on the making of a film is very seldom appreciated the extras on the dvd gives an excellent insight to the making of a film as for the story of the film i'm bias i happen to rave about it to all my friends but as i said before i relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation not of his own choosing the mafia in <UNK> use to their money in a swiss bank he owes them for <UNK> them millions of dollars years ago in stock market deal that went wrong love kills
<START> all i can say is that i was expecting a movie and <UNK> surprised me on the positive way very nice teenager movie all this kinds of situations are normal on school life so all i can say is that all this reminded me my school times and sometimes it's good to watch this kind of movies because entertain us and travel us back to those golden years when we were young as well lead us to think better in the way we must understand our children because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time try this movie and you will be very pleased at the same time you will have the guarantee that your time have not been wasted
<START> <UNK> is a good <UNK> of old the <UNK> <UNK> saying if you don't know where you are going you will probably end up <UNK> else writer director christina in her first feature has managed to make a 3 million movie that ends up <UNK> else <UNK> is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with a black comedy without any humor or a <UNK> movie without anything that is particularly sexy br br unlike the standard <UNK> film <UNK> actually employed a competent and experienced production designer good enough to provide two extremely nice shots the scene of <UNK> and barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of <UNK> in the park featuring a nice montage of the alice in wonderland <UNK> the symbolism <UNK> into these elements supports the possibility that despite the absence of a linear logic or <UNK> of tone actually has some <UNK> talent and aspirations for making a quality film br br it is even possible that was trying for a <UNK> of the somewhat <UNK> <UNK> and the camp classic cruel intentions which also deal with the manhattan upper class there are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes the former technique <UNK> at symbolism and the latter at intentional <UNK> from the characters and their motivations <UNK> seemed on the verge of <UNK> into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased <UNK> into the garbage <UNK> then there is the whole bit about her father being jewish played to the same extreme as joel grey dancing with the jewish <UNK> in <UNK> br br in her other films <UNK> acting technique is to <UNK> each scene in which she appears insert scenery chewing here but in <UNK> she actually shows an ability to <UNK> herself this is the best performance of her career it also provides some clues about her physical <UNK> from <UNK> super cute in girl to <UNK> <UNK> faced in <UNK> this transformation was about half complete by the time she made <UNK> so go the <UNK> of time br br <UNK> barton sixth i feel better girl and <UNK> are excellent in supporting roles the rest of the cast is simply horrible although some of the blame for this should go to script and direction
<START> this movie has the feel of a college project over it who wants to do a blair witch project meets saw theme but it isn't successful the cinematography is poor and the acting even more so the characters in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all the editing of the film isn't really working as intended either there are a lot of poor effects which i believe are put in there to try and add a horrid effect but to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference br br i would stay away from this movie unless you are a dedicated movie freak who likes to watch different and indie horror movies however i believe this movie is not worth watching for the average person you will get no pleasure out of the poor effects and the <UNK> feel which this movie on it's viewers
<START> the movie starts in spring 2001 a soldier named john <UNK> <UNK> falls in love with college student <UNK> amanda while on break within the space of two weeks they fall <UNK> in love with each other but he has to go off to war and she has to go to college they do but keep in touch by writing to each other then 9 11 happens he wants to she wants him to stay home what will they do br br hysterically bad romantic drama the leads are attractive <UNK> is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body he's introduced walking <UNK> out of the water after surfing but he can't act is a beautiful woman and she tries but the dialogue here is horrible when i saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard not to laugh out loud at some of the romantic dialogue at the beginning it was just horrible for the first hour or so i was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous romance then after that first hour tragedy kicks in and i must admit had me in tears however the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you're crying with death <UNK> and <UNK> with people breaking down in tears how can you not cry this would have worked if the acting were better <UNK> face never changes expression not once he always had a blank look on his face was a little better but not much to make it worse <UNK> and had no sexual chemistry on screen at all they barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other there was some beautiful photography of the <UNK> but this is a boring and stupid romantic drama a 1 all the way and i usually love silly romantic dramas like this
<START> excellent and highly under rated from beginning to end one of <UNK> best well scripted directed shot acted and soundtrack trivia the music during the end credits vaguely sounds like a late 90's pop hit by band br br eric and cast are brilliant let alone the <UNK> what a <UNK> of emotions it <UNK> your hair stand on end <UNK> will be broke and <UNK> will crack in a old female southern accent creepy scary than any horror movie br br 10 out of 10 br br em
<START> imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience grey instead of white no snow fights and certainly no this is the <UNK> as portrayed by <UNK> this film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each <UNK> with results beyond anyone's nightmares yes most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can completely annoying and frustrating to watch yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn br br with some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together <UNK> somewhat mainstream faces frozen land offers a glimpse of the <UNK> mentality that despite its depressing <UNK> <UNK> manages to <UNK> some faith in humanity more so than to say the least
<START> in out made me want to vomit i have never seen such a shameless film it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and <UNK> but has no idea how to say it to me this was not a comedy unless cruel sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it br br from what i saw this film had four 4 major flaws starting with a matt character as he <UNK> to the world that is former teacher howard <UNK> kevin kline is gay never mind how unbelievable it is that matt <UNK> character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack up but why would he say such a thing after all this was never an issue with <UNK> students his friends family nor his nobody so why would he say something like it when it wasn't true more to the point why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it the reason is because there is no answer and for the <UNK> of the plot none is provided the second b flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex in this movie being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature it's all based on stereotypes br br both of these flaws are met up again at that must be seen to be believed <UNK> ceremony matt <UNK> finds out about the <UNK> going on in that small town and the film looks <UNK> to let us know what made him say such a thing when he arrives to the ceremony he says nothing and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all he didn't solve anything then when all of the audience stood to <UNK> they were gay i was so moved i wanted to throw up those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot but wait there's more br br during the ceremony c howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay what the film was trying to say is that <UNK> never <UNK> and that he wouldn't influence his students but did we not see tom character endlessly pressure howard over and over again even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly to come out of the closet when in my mind there was no closet to come out of from that the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of <UNK> the film again then shoots itself in the foot br br and d when howard came out of the closet did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film i counted only three lines he had afterwards <UNK> to his parents hi there to a student and are you ready to tom <UNK> before the last <UNK> scene i might be low by one but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay i wanted to know what was in his head because i never for once believed he was gay br br as <UNK> the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend him who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his <UNK> does that make him gay he asks the priest oh yes he's definitely gay uh huh or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling <UNK> mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep dark secret because well everyone has them then one the ladies <UNK> that she's never seen the bridges of madison county funny no <UNK> the film shows that it is <UNK> and has no idea how it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he she is gay i know i have several friends that are gay and none of their families took it well at all that was a poor way to the whole situation br br the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they <UNK> that tom and kevin were getting married the camera <UNK> down very slowly to the front of the church when it wasn't what you thought i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point and i never could forgive that sick joke i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality philadelphia and longtime companion were very honest and true in what they had to say in out is just screaming for political correctness but has no idea of the corruption at its core what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99 straight and 1 gay meaning if you have the doubt you are definitely gay it's like <UNK> is becoming a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid you would eventually believe it too wouldn't you this is what happened to howard <UNK> about being gay i left the theater sad and angry angry the whole weekend in fact this was a seriously sick and cruel film the worst of 1997
<START> this movie was not very good in my opinion while not a complete waste of an hour and a half luckily i didn't have to pay for it it just wasn't very scary there were parts where i jumped and a few <UNK> violent gory scenes but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scary br br the overall writing and acting were very weak the characters never evolved or grew as people even at the end the lead guy whatever his name was didn't man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute the plot also had inconsistencies the police officer who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game the girl october mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape the malcolm in the middle kid died in the game but didn't die in real life also making the game play by itself was very weak writing it would have been okay for the brother's death just to get them playing again but you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again why do you even need the game if you like movies like the ring and thing its scary and fun watch this movie if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at do it if you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free do it otherwise stay far far away
<START> a less than <UNK> junk that is mercifully free from the <UNK> of <UNK> some northern idiots come to the deep south looking for some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the legendary <UNK> mountain they are <UNK> by scary <UNK> in a wide nod to <UNK> but it turns out that the <UNK> are for a northern marijuana <UNK> <UNK> this is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist the women are locked up and raped into <UNK> rather than <UNK> them the guys run down to town to get the sheriff who is lazy and doesn't believe them i think if my girlfriend were being raped i'd kind of take the <UNK> route to the <UNK> anyway it's ok though because as soon as they show up to the baddies the girls get all <UNK> and hop around if only trauma were like this in real life also featuring a backwoods guy with a beard who <UNK> a lot not exactly <UNK> at the <UNK> with ideas
<START> i always loved this film the music story and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake <UNK> is his <UNK> after all <UNK> singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and <UNK> singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music i was glad when the dvd arrived now i can <UNK> in the dark watching it again and again
<START> i saw the original rough screen showing 4 times at <UNK> a couple years ago i was delighted to have done so my daughter is in the movie br br i stood in the back of the room with her watching the much younger fans sit on the edge of there seats dead quiet no wanting to miss a line the standing <UNK> was like watching the fans when the usa hockey team beat the russians at the olympic games in <UNK> br br i love excellent comedy and sight gags taxi barney miller cheers <UNK> and married with are my all time favorite comedy shows lesser shows i will not even watch br br this movie will do for <UNK> what animal house did for college frat days what dodge ball did for weird sports forget the lack of a mega budget backing the production this is pure art it's that good br br i could not be happier for the entire cast and production company
<START> well i'm a few days late but what the hell anyways the word that best describes my reaction to see no evil was surprise the film is actually pretty good there is definitely an ample amount of blood gore action in the film with a modest amount of suspense it <UNK> back to the good <UNK> slasher days of the late 70's early 80s think madman meets <UNK> with a dash of norman bates and you'll get a good feel for this flick while is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violence methods of killing the gore suspense the fact that kane does a great job of playing the highly disturbed <UNK> <UNK> the title of the film comes from the fact that <UNK> <UNK> out the eyes of his victims using just his fingers stores them in big <UNK> why you'll just have to watch it see pun intended there are certain cinematic elements lifted from other horror films most notably psycho tcm madman but they're not blatant finally really doesn't go into territory we long <UNK> haven't seen before granted is no or tcm <UNK> but it certainly merits a look imo br br recommendation take in a <UNK> showing of see no evil rating 7 5 10
<START> watch the <UNK> 2005 60 minutes is an excellent documentary about movies of science fiction it was produced and directed by the critic richard author of more than 20 books on this theme mark <UNK> is the documentary narrator joins directors as steven spielberg james cameron george lucas and <UNK> scott to carry through a trip in time and space to show some of the most memorable science fiction movies of the fifties and also some more recent classics the documentary shows six different approaches the paranoia of the atomic war the fantastic <UNK> to the moon the enigmatic planet mars good and evil aliens the after apocalyptic world and the humanity future it presents comments and scenes of the following classics the flying <UNK> destination moon the space children the beast from 20 000 <UNK> godzilla king of the monsters the incredible <UNK> man attack of the killer tomatoes a trip to the moon the angry red planet forbidden planet the thing from another world earth vs the flying <UNK> i married a monster from outer space invasion of the body <UNK> the blob the war of the worlds the day the earth stood still et the extra <UNK> the <UNK> man the planet of the apes the terminator 2001 a space odyssey things to come and metropolis highly recommended to science fiction fans
<START> some people thought this was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece i however am so tired of the state of the two party system in our country that i can't stomach propaganda from either side i was hoping for a horror show but got cute zombies and <UNK> bull crap i watch my horror films to be scared this didn't even attempt to be scary also this doesn't have the wit of romero in his political cultural satire laced in his movies this was a blatant no imagination story that was hard for me to stomach for the wrong reasons on the bright side if you hate bush you'll love this i'm not <UNK> hate or bush with this statement
<START> when i first saw this i thought it was a joke all i could think was you get the <UNK> camera i'll get my little brother's monster toys we'll make a movie why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci fi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80's with actors that are as wooden as a <UNK> store indian a script that was written by the director's 4 year old son a camera that was stolen from a burning <UNK> shop poverty row special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous the end result wasn't spectacular complete with <UNK> dialogue and continuity from <UNK> must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie br br a 2 out of 10 for a <UNK> hopeless effort br br
<START> clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it <UNK> with the classy horrors of the likes of <UNK> but with other 70s low budget drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic the lack of money shows does anyone care too much the acting is adequate rather than professional does that make it more realistic but unlike so many other movies and not just low budget ones this does not drag for a moment crap it may be but non stop crap in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what i'm talking about at times quite delirious this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch
<START> after finishing the zero woman series i was looking forward to the female prisoner <UNK> series both based upon comics by unfortunately i was not able to see them in order as this is the third in the series br br it starts great as the <UNK> is escaping from the police detective did manage to get a <UNK> on her but she <UNK> to cut off his arm and get away if that isn't bad enough later on a dog <UNK> up the arm and is seen <UNK> down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat br br <UNK> might as well go back to prison as life is no <UNK> on the outside first a local <UNK> v threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of but they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance br br soon they are dropping like flies some certainly deserved it for wearing <UNK> outfits with shirt <UNK> so big they went all the way to the shoulder the <UNK> lee turns herself in to avoid getting killed br br the police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the <UNK> she's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend <UNK> has been <UNK> her with food the story o <UNK> <UNK> and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but only incidental to the movie they try to burn her out but this is the <UNK> and she has some unfinished business br br not the usual mix of sex and violence this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout
<START> just before dawn is an excellent horror movie it is atmospheric filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature in which few young people meet their doom in the shape of two crazed fat <UNK> who slaughter them jeff is very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underrated he achieved to built tension not with gore but with showing menacing nature environment succeeds to built a tension in a very linear simplistic way which is also the best way not to show to the viewer the gore but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters br br just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre deliverance and hills have eyes it is as good looking as deliverance better than hills i mean scarier and better crafted and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre br br is one of the best horrors of past few decades who finally lives on dvd
<START> what can be said about such a pathetic movie br br very bad acting the main actress seems to know only one facial expression fear mixed with weakness like a poor beaten dog the other actress the one who plays the evil looks like the female double of <UNK> <UNK> with an awful red wig the other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described br br there's absolutely no plot the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere we don't know anything about the meaning of 11 11 nor who really is <UNK> the simple she's evil or she's a child of apocalypse which is not an explanation we don't know why the parents have been killed what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen as the film goes on we just watch pseudo scary scenes with a bad music moreover the end doesn't tell anything we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut there's no plot so no possible interpretation br br 11 11 is just full of clich√©s it is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing for example the deserted library or the bathroom scenes ghost <UNK> walking with a blast of wind there's even the <UNK> little scary girl as in dark water or the ring of course the main character is <UNK> at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl dark hair red lips skinny black clothes is it an <UNK> to make her credible i don't think so the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible nor endearing br br terrible direction as i said nothing original everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose br br there are some funny <UNK> for example i don't know if ghost science <UNK> course or whatever is taught in american <UNK> in europe it is really not the case teachers talking about negative <UNK> or using creatures <UNK> ridiculous also how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super 8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a <UNK> in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen and how can you on this old film <UNK> a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly <UNK> face i wonder if the director has ever tried to an old <UNK> film br br eventually 11 11 just <UNK> being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch but it's an expensive way to fall asleep
<START> jennifer <UNK> art for teachers of children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece <UNK> gritty <UNK> and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly <UNK> performances she evokes from her cast <UNK> the sense of shocking raw realism in this <UNK> story of a 14 year old <UNK> seduction of her married <UNK> school <UNK> <UNK> the scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing jennifer <UNK> grace <UNK> and <UNK> mother actually voiced by ruth <UNK> on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful i've ever seen captured on film the lesson ultimately learned here there's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art well i would highly recommend this remarkable piece of art for anyone interested in thought provoking independent cinema
<START> for those who like their films full of exploding planets and extreme violence this is definitely not one to see in fact there is very little plot at all or at least very little that could not be <UNK> in a few seconds a meets b mr a falls for mrs b and has an affair with her a and b then fall in love and wonder at great length whether to have an affair themselves br br this is <UNK> visconti story there is none but what you do get is a succession of wonderful images and <UNK> trivial music which convey the slow passage of the central characters' emotions there is also the chance to see one of the world's most beautiful women in a succession of stunningly elegant outfits for my money it's worth seeing for that alone how could this woman ever have been an action heroine she looks as though she has stepped straight out of the pages of <UNK>
<START> having just seen this i find it hard to believe that it is not better known this and the slightly better known but almost as <UNK> neglected come and see 1986 must be two of the greatest war films they are meaningful powerful <UNK> the <UNK> is also gifted with a <UNK> used but brilliantly <UNK> score by
<START> yawn that is my reaction to this film i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers instead it tries to be something it isn't which is a psychological thriller and it fails so miserably at this even the title freak suggests that this might be interesting match this with the cover art on the dvd and you think ok maybe i will give this one a try not worth the time br br the story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor <UNK> child with <UNK> wrapped around his head being <UNK> up by his fat mother she yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason after all this he decides he has had enough and <UNK> her face in with i believe a rock present day he is now in insane asylum and is being <UNK> on his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes introduce also the 2 leads characters a little girl and her older sister they are moving and hit the road so most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves but the <UNK> freak is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of <UNK> murder this is me being totally sarcastic br br i can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be the budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog i could just care less about this is one of those movie where the <UNK> is better then the flick itself and to compare this to halloween rubbish i am not even a fan of the the halloween series except the 3rd one but halloween is far superior than this at least with halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments with this there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie maybe this movie would have <UNK> better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good br br well that is just my opinion on the movie i thought it was just a complete <UNK> of time and money but since the movie has over a 4 10 rating on imdb there must be people that like this movie i am not one of those people 2 10
<START> this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 <UNK> it's done really <UNK> and big stupid running off one liners like a cardboard <UNK> but jack <UNK> steals every scene he's in as the <UNK> jesse now <UNK> my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the <UNK> voice going up 10 <UNK> you loved her danny big <UNK> is surprisingly <UNK> but not as <UNK> as our lead star there's also a quaint scene of a guy <UNK> at the diner <UNK> meadows is the sweet naive nice gal and probably the least annoying and those yellow oh and booze is evil according to mr stupid br br this movie's a hoot watch the <UNK> cover of this and terrific <UNK> homage
<START> please do not go see this i did have several laughs throughout this movie but they were all due to unintentional comedy br br there were only three characters in this movie so it was amazing how bad the character development was pacino played pacino again and was <UNK> most of the time the scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor there is no continuity and i found myself wondering why i didn't leave 15 minutes into this br br i would suggest never seeing a movie directed by d j caruso this really was awful
<START> what a waste of time i got about five minutes into it and became very <UNK> and was soon fast <UNK> a bit and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast forward button was nonexistent actors mark <UNK> and barry murphy did very capable jobs i thought but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance again take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldn't make it to the end heck i couldn't make it to the middle br br i find myself unable to submit this review because it isn't long enough maybe this last sentence will put it over the top
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed carmen better than original sin angelina jolie antonio <UNK> which share some <UNK> similarities and which i also enjoyed very much i felt the acting was stronger here paz vega displayed a wider range has more fire and was also great overall their acting was more gritty more believable less dreamy than original sin and both actors here had less <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to depend on to make the movie work vega definitely <UNK> as to be expected br br director <UNK> has also built a detailed world again better than original sin that lets you feel the <UNK> and the daily goings on of <UNK> spain for example people <UNK> goods from a <UNK> on the street workers changing the <UNK> of the street <UNK> all in the background of the action br br whilst i greatly sympathize with the recent idea of redeeming our femme like brian de palma's femme fatale carmen is a poignant modern take in the tradition of the noir classic double <UNK> and is a delightful pleasure to watch this is another fine example of the triumph of daring european cinema over <UNK> and safe hollywood fare
<START> ah such an original title for a very shoddy film the dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match as a result i had no idea what was going on as i watched this mess unfold there are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end the aztec ceremony had me laughing i <UNK> it twice and got the best <UNK> <UNK> ever the singing aztec lady is comic and the dancing and costumes are a hoot some guy gets a face full of acid there's a lot of fighting you have no idea who any character is not that i really cared and it's a whole noir mess oh and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile so during the movie feel free to get up take a <UNK> take a trip you won't miss anything exciting
<START> to speak relatively if one were only to see now hector <UNK> 1981 brazil <UNK> as <UNK> shot after having seen quite a number of films that deal with street children juvenile <UNK> kids in trouble <UNK> the 400 blows <UNK> los <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on a <UNK> etc one might be afraid that the plight of the kid portrayed in the film might not affect one anymore having been de <UNK> already after going through the emotional roller coaster ride put in motion by the previously <UNK> films br br thankfully that won't be the case for <UNK> his film in such a matter of fact manner <UNK> as one film reviewer put it in a positive light and that his central child performer <UNK> <UNK> da <UNK> 13 years old at that time and a street kid himself gives such a no <UNK> wounded performance raw in its simplicity that hardened face those lonely and longing eyes that one is hard put not to be <UNK> in any way such a feeling may achieve such a <UNK> realism when one learns that the child had only lived but a short life having been involved in street crimes after the film and subsequently murdered br br in about first half of the film <UNK> and his fellow street kids and <UNK> spend their time in a <UNK> state run <UNK> school where and <UNK> rape and murder are the norm and culture where they are forced to confess to their crimes on the flimsy notion that under the brazilian law <UNK> <UNK> are not <UNK> for their <UNK> for these kids the dubious freedom offered by the streets is more <UNK> than the harsh <UNK> provided by these supposed well meaning authorities within the walls of this supposed protective establishment these young souls are soon to discover that love and care from <UNK> figures are likewise nowhere to be found if not to a degree <UNK> br br for <UNK> the only form of escape comes from <UNK> grass and <UNK> <UNK> secretly <UNK> inside the <UNK> br br when the kids burst themselves into a small scale revolt to finally express and then fulfill their collective desire to get back to the outside world their home the intensity and form are of such a kind that one can't avoid thinking of the revolt in jean <UNK> influential zero for conduct it's only that in <UNK> the <UNK> is made to appear on a <UNK> level br br once <UNK> and his small group are back on the streets the film's second half they engage in robbery <UNK> and drug dealing to <UNK> for themselves along which they get to meet a <UNK> but kindly prostitute willingly the four lost souls in such a way that she allows her customers to be robbed by them and that she provides more than <UNK> care at least to one of the children br br one would have thought that the street kids have at long last found the one person who can provide them the love and warmth that have been sorely lacking in their lives but as dubious as the freedom that these kids believe the streets are providing this new found <UNK> figure cannot but stay forever br br jealousy <UNK> differences and murder have only set the kids apart and for good and during that defining scene where <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> gets to shoot not just arrogant american <UNK> but also his fellow street <UNK> <UNK> more than a son to he thereafter literally goes back to <UNK> as he sucks from the right breast of the <UNK> woman right there and then <UNK> his lingering desire for <UNK> affection the image itself both sad and unsettling br br it is so that in a <UNK> coming back to her senses <UNK> pushes back <UNK> from his <UNK> position and rejects him for good thus in a quietly wrenching moment <UNK> with that young old face and those <UNK> eyes not entirely <UNK> though in a different context to the young boy's in <UNK> <UNK> harrowing come and see gets himself up puts on his coat and takes his gun yes a gun and sets off to nowhere walking along the train tracks and with the morning light just beginning to show up with that scene may just be doing an homage amongst many other <UNK> found in different films to the <UNK> final scene in <UNK> the 400 blows br br but whereas we got to know what has become of <UNK> <UNK> three years later in the short film <UNK> et <UNK> as well as in three other feature films in the years thereafter we are left <UNK> in the dark as to what lies ahead for <UNK> after he finally disappears from the last frame that being the last time that we'll get to see this real life street child notwithstanding the fate that eventually <UNK> him in <UNK> br br <UNK> may not be as nearly as whimsical as the 400 blows or as <UNK> as los <UNK> but it still stands out among films of similar theme and <UNK> because of its simple raw power
<START> a group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral <UNK> for a halloween party they get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally <UNK> the possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by angela <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> and talks in a really deep voice the remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house br br this is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include <UNK> <UNK> who has a couple nude scenes as usual <UNK> out a guy's <UNK> and pushing a tube of <UNK> into her <UNK> there's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out this is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza the terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though overall i would give it a 7 out of 10
<START> because it's late and i'm running short on <UNK> i will describe this film as beautiful and heartbreaking begging the forgiveness of those who cringe at such cliches robin <UNK> does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the <UNK> of <UNK> syndrome her character was absolutely sincere and convincing and i will follow her career wherever it goes because of this film
<START> i've already seen spin offs of cartoons such as the <UNK> scooby doo tom and jerry and looney tunes and most of them are great br br when i saw the all grown up pilot in 2001 i thought it was interesting to see how the <UNK> would look in their pre teens teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert going to school and being grounded br br the actual tv show is better because the <UNK> seem to wear different clothes in each episode and <UNK> doesn't get <UNK> as much as she did in the original <UNK> series tommy and <UNK> get <UNK> in this series br br i've also noticed references to <UNK> in this show and even flashbacks of how the <UNK> looked in the original series they actually talk to the adults in this show because they're 10 years older br br this show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original <UNK> viewers of the original show may like this
<START> ah when good actors take on bland material if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed while the situations are very true to life the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion much of the dialog is just plain silly br br but if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it then you will love this movie sam elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one note character of detective <UNK> come alive with depth and pathos those of you who have never seen elliott <UNK> that much beyond his usual <UNK> stoic <UNK> will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film and also in his early fifties in this film he looks fantastic his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere <UNK> <UNK> does a wonderful job <UNK> his role as <UNK> eager <UNK> new police partner he could have easily played it as a robin to <UNK> batman but instead he <UNK> a <UNK> and passion into this role he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say br br paul sorvino is fun to watch he plays the eccentric police captain he seems to know he is <UNK> in this movie and is having a ball doing it he makes it fun for us too br br this movie is very by the numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do
<START> is correct that this little short is just an excuse to hear a very young judy garland <UNK> years old singing with a slightly older by one year deanna durbin but i must disagree with everything else he or she said including the running time which is only about ten minutes not twenty a single <UNK> br br the song is not her best obviously but it's enjoyable and definitely worth the ten minutes to watch on turner the <UNK> with durbin is quite interesting two <UNK> styles that nevertheless <UNK> reasonably well br br the short is just a throwaway but it's nowhere near as bad as the other reviewer made it out to be honestly i enjoyed it br br <UNK> hugh
<START> the premise of the movie had much going for it however despite the novelty of models selling off someone else's furniture to live the high life this movie has nothing going for it the characters are cardboard the dialog is so painfully scripted it's hard to sit through and if there were any jokes in the movie i missed them marilyn <UNK> walking into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable not funny <UNK> stupidity is also too ham <UNK> to be believed <UNK> gold digging is so forced it's annoying to listen to why anyone would want to sit through this is beyond me
<START> this is a very unusual film which starts out with a rich dude getting a brand new sports car for <UNK> and decides to take it for a spin in the local town rich boy meets poor girl in is a waitress and local boy friend gets very upset and a fight starts out there is a car chase and all kinds of problems seem to take place and the rich boy and poor boy wind up having to do community service as ordered by the town judge rich boy and poor boy just do not get along and the rich boy winds up winning the heart and soul of the poor boy's girl friend there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is <UNK> and some very deep thoughts about life poor girl says some people go through life and never find love i can say that i found love and am holding on to it you will need some if you are sensitive there are plenty of romantic scenes and i doubt very much if you will guess how this picture will end the producer and director came up with a good idea and finally put an end to a film if you like true to life stories with poetry and very sensitive subjects this is your film
<START> after receiving a dvd of this with a sunday newspaper i hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them i was wrong acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school <UNK> production and the same goes for the majority of the cast <UNK> is satisfactory but plays a russian and isn't helped by his hybrid northern irish new zealand accent and nor are the rest of the <UNK> characters all of whom sound like they're in a <UNK> reunion in fact the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there <UNK> letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash the espionage factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of sheen about in various ridiculous <UNK> whilst trying to blend into the background quickly becoming not only boring but laughable the plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements this could have been so much better
<START> an entertaining first draft for north by <UNK> <UNK> has some wonderful <UNK> moments one of the best occurs at a table when the hero is asked by a woman who hasn't yet seen that he's wearing <UNK> to give her a plate trying to do that he also drops a knife to the floor exposing himself even more but suffers from a poorly chosen lead whether he's delivering patriotic speeches <UNK> <UNK> lane making jokes or trying to look worried robert <UNK> is wooden and from a lack of really distinct villains oh there are villains many of them but hardly anyone has enough screen time
<START> a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind <UNK> nearby an ancient abandoned western town of despite <UNK> by the local sheriff murphy john phillip law old man <UNK> richard lynch a <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> tourists with supposed <UNK> wanted posters and <UNK> <UNK> aunt <UNK> karen black to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend that an evil coal <UNK> who sold his soul to devil and murdered a <UNK> jeff <UNK> daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his <UNK> these people only see the green not the blood red which could potentially <UNK> from their <UNK> bodies finding the gold of stone intact they line their <UNK> and carrying cases prepared for the bright <UNK> that supposedly lie ahead but when you do not <UNK> the <UNK> of those you consider backwoods the obvious result will be gruesome death stone as we see is lying merely a <UNK> near an alter containing <UNK> <UNK> next to each other as the <UNK> on top of them light up the underneath awaiting it's master with dust <UNK> returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition his eyes with wrath this hapless group hoping for some fun around the <UNK> with gold providing them with warm <UNK> for life ahead will fall prey to the vengeful <UNK> and his mean another victim will meet the nasty end of a <UNK> thrown through the <UNK> of her vehicle directing it's path straight into her neck another failed attempt to <UNK> has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree his body <UNK> in flames as he fails to escape without harm another a local girl searching for her new friends worried about their well being receives the buried into her stomach aunt <UNK> informs those still alive about the forty and the curse on those who <UNK> his eternal <UNK> and pays the price for relating such information will anybody survive or is the entire group <UNK> to <UNK> at the hands of the zombie <UNK> br br make up effects artist and monster creator john carl directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story telling <UNK> instead to allow his zombie <UNK> to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path he provides just enough back story and this is feeble at best for the killer allowing special guest star karen black oh how her career has <UNK> into the <UNK> to explain to the viewer about him the story given to us has the <UNK> holding a <UNK> daughter hostage threatening to <UNK> her as the authorities warn against such an action startling enough stone plants that right into her back with the opposition <UNK> their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan <UNK> to his <UNK> the mine <UNK> stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his the <UNK> typical of most slashers in general this bunch of twenty somethings are your garden variety victims with little development other than some banter and <UNK> of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them they are the usual group from the city <UNK> <UNK> unfamiliar territory <UNK> an evil that should remain <UNK> like many of the later 80's slashers a good deal of the violence is off screen what is on screen the minimal gore is rather <UNK> presented and happens rather quickly the <UNK> make up for the killer is only shown occasionally he's mostly <UNK> in darkness the <UNK> horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more <UNK> than the method of destruction one <UNK> for certain stunt men were set on fire many times at least three times a character is burned alive by either a <UNK> or <UNK> vehicle martin <UNK> has a minor cameo as <UNK> former husband <UNK> now living with a much younger and dense honey <UNK> wells of the road warrior and <UNK> fame has the back story role of stone as a human still capturing the same type of menace he <UNK> in john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and <UNK> sheriff <UNK> the <UNK> to his neck of the woods has quite an attractive cast of actresses all wearing tight pants and shirts showing off their <UNK> and athletic figures especially <UNK> madison as easy lay <UNK> always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk hayden rick stephen the ghosts of <UNK> is <UNK> a rather clumsy foil used as a butt of many jokes including his dump in the woods scene and current <UNK> status
<START> this opens with the company credits <UNK> us it s by world international network i knew i d seen this company credit before but <UNK> t remember where but knew it was at the start of a really bad movie i d seen so i seriously thought about changing channels only thing was i d seen every film on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an imdb reviewer what the hell i thought it won t really matter if wanted is good or bad because i ll still be able to review it for this site br br as i expected wanted <UNK> t all that good it s a plot i d seen so many times too many times before involving a fugitive on the run a bit like the incredible hulk tv series without the shirt ripping jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely contrived way and goes on the run and in an entirely contrived manner finds himself working at a catholic <UNK> school have you noticed an <UNK> used description in the last sentence entirely contrived is the answer let me repeat for the hard of thinking that this is an entirely contrived film where everything relies on coincidence another problem i had was the <UNK> school run by the church it s far too compassionate and kind i m led to believe these type of <UNK> make <UNK> look like a country club i m saying this is a fact but when the head priest looks like the spitting image of donald <UNK> you do feel there s a large amount of sugar <UNK> going on br br to be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc wanted <UNK> t really a bad thriller though it s a terribly good one either i never really had the urge to switch it off no matter how contrived it became which is an under hand compliment to the movie
<START> what a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the golden gate bridge of san francisco in this exciting action picture although the characters and the story are in fact bad it still has a certain cult flair
<START> i rented this movie today worst movie ever it was a total waste of time and a horrible story the acting was horrible especially by the actress of <UNK> she was so bad it was ridiculous i can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place i can't even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was i'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it br br if you're looking for a good vampire horror flick this is not the movie for you move right along it's a waste of time and money heck i wouldn't even <UNK> this movie if someone paid me br br this movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve a 1 i wish i could give it a 0
<START> anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows and <UNK> what they are going to get having said that i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad and still be compelling i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end first off it's an <UNK> action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of taxi 's christopher lloyd and rambo he puts posters of himself dressed up like <UNK> <UNK> all over the place and even has a <UNK> built firing range with action <UNK> <UNK> of his greatest enemies in <UNK> although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier there is a lot of action involving gun play no <UNK> flashes on those m <UNK> only sound effects <UNK> that bust through walls karate where no one makes physical contact and even some sex where all the actors are ugly the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible but not here it involves the world's most dangerous drug <UNK> going all out to find a drug <UNK> device why would they need it that is never revealed why not kill drug <UNK> dogs makes no sense but it is taken seriously the actors are to be <UNK> because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to act best line now dance to your grave you dirty whore best scene rambo jumps onto flying helicopter pulls machine gun out of hand let's go falls shoots helicopter as he's falling helicopter blows up cut to <UNK> thrown in water f king genius if you can't appreciate trash don't watch it if you can it's awesome one last thing did i mention it was directed by the three <UNK> brothers
<START> this is movie is garbage it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this don't waste anyone's money on this i gave it a 1 10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back
<START> this stupid anti environment wannabe jaws is sad pathetic boring poorly dubbed and stupid there is nothing redeeming about it br br plot follows some shark <UNK> creature <UNK> that appears off the coast of florida and kills some people including a boring stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a <UNK> for some reason his <UNK> to the surface is always represented by a vague of something <UNK> over and over it makes no sense it's horribly boring and it's conspiracy plot sucks br br there are moments of camp that cannot be ignored the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence three times the doctor <UNK> a dying <UNK> chest twenty times with a without stopping even though he's clearly dead the porno <UNK> soundtrack the shot of the couple making love on the beach with three different that us is getting ahead of us doing this the ancient computer that sounds like <UNK> the frog a beer <UNK> scientist screaming i know a la dr smith the list goes on and on br br oh and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie much noticed by mike and the br br the mst3k version is their best episode but it's certainly better than the movie itself this is how i like to go fishing guys with a <UNK> and a <UNK> crow br br one star for devil fish seven for the mst3k version br br
<START> <UNK> or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences is set in tokyo starts as sunny plant sales employee decides to visit her friend <UNK> <UNK> to about a computer <UNK> he's been working on when she gets to his place he gives her the <UNK> but then rather <UNK> commits suicide in front of her meanwhile a student named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has recently hooked up to the internet keeps getting spooky messages images on his <UNK> so he <UNK> computer <UNK> <UNK> whats happening she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full they need somewhere else to go earth is as good a place as any right these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into <UNK> or something like that i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess br br this japanese production was written directed by <UNK> kurosawa right off the bat i have to say i hated <UNK> i hated everything about it it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker the script is an overlong mess the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way <UNK> is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through i really wanted to fast forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end frankly wished i hadn't there are so many things wrong with <UNK> i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all i use the internet all day it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way then there's the fact that <UNK> as a film provided zero entertainment value for me maybe i'm a <UNK> but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me make some sort of sense not bore me to death br br director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you i didn't think <UNK> was scary in the slightest the whole internet thing was laughable as for scary you should see some of the penis <UNK> pop up ads i get now that's scary i hate this film i hate this film i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again twice forget about any action tension or gore as there isn't any if you have a very nervous <UNK> then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way <UNK> br br the film looks so dull boring it's untrue the camera just sits there for very long shots when it does move it moves very slowly this has all the style of a mexican soap opera since <UNK> is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language you don't know what they are saying br br <UNK> is crap i hated it it's as simple straight forward as that just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense it's an absolute bore means <UNK> would rightly be torn to <UNK> by people if it were an american production the worst film i've seen this year by some distance <UNK> got a hollywood remake as pulse 2006
<START> when i was a child my grandmother took me to see this movie and i fell in love with it i admired dorothy <UNK> so very much and wanted to be like her i fell in love with sidney <UNK> pearl <UNK> made me laugh and sammy davis jr was so great as life the music was just breath taken when i had my first son and the movie came on tv i let him see it and to this day he has never forgotten this movie he loved it i will always remember and <UNK> it has a special place in my heart then and now i really wish that they would <UNK> this movie because it was one of the greatest movies there has ever been with an all star black cast
<START> new york family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set which nearly ruins david <UNK> marriage to <UNK> <UNK> bedroom comedy that rarely <UNK> into the bedroom and nothing sexy happens there anyway <UNK> as an actress has about as much range as an <UNK> she turns on she turns off film's sole <UNK> is a supporting performance by <UNK> patty duke pre miracle worker as <UNK> daughter she's delightful happy <UNK> is not from
<START> this movie was rented for free i had no <UNK> about this being a very bad movie i rented it for <UNK> because we eat turkey and then the family watches an awful movie so you ask what makes this movie so bad you gave it only 2 stars dialog the lack of dialog makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience in fact if you rent this just turn the volume down to zero and pop in any heavy metal cd from your favorite artist i know you will enjoy it better the plot of this holiday turkey was so <UNK> with tech and geek speak you need a <UNK> for the narrative now for all you people who enjoy good sci fi effects eh they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse the actors um both of them are not much to look at either they say nothing much through out the entire movie many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero <UNK> herself to a missile and fires it at the city away it never showed how she landed the scene before that we see a robotic <UNK> fire at her with a cannon from 12 feet away and he misses multiple shots also we are told that the political division between the antagonist and protagonist is bio tech <UNK> enhanced humans vs <UNK> tech machine enhanced humans but both seem to be <UNK> or enhanced humans what told me this was a bad movie at the rental store was the cover that looked like a video game cover art and there was only the one copy good new releases have many copies available
<START> i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and <UNK> studied some at school something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library well i <UNK> with it olivier seemed far too old not only in his looks but in his acting of the part the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it soon became bored and annoyed by it i still think <UNK> henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play <UNK> admit i haven't <UNK> the <UNK> version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown br br i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet although i enjoyed his much <UNK> i think the <UNK> version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of <UNK> <UNK> lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the <UNK> br br finally <UNK> the complete <UNK> shakespeare on dvd recently i soon <UNK> one of my most favourite shakespeare plays richard ii and was simply enthralled by <UNK> in the part so was immediately <UNK> to watch his hamlet next what a revelation this play now is for me yes it is splendid but i feel it needs an actor you can with to play hamlet and this for me is <UNK> amazing intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh so i shall have to watch that to see what does with <UNK> i'm interested to discover <UNK> has trained branagh as yes you can certainly see the influence br br and now i'm going to watch it all over again
<START> this movie could have been a lot better than it was if hadn't been a disney film i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right the teenage shirley temple wasn't right at all i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood the first hour should have been about the young shirley then the last hour should have been about the older shirley this was a boring movie and not a good shirley temple story
<START> ever since midnight <UNK> i have been on the <UNK> for films with dustin hoffman and have mostly not been disappointed ever since kramer vs i have been on the <UNK> for films with meryl streep and have mostly not been disappointed she gave a superb performance really one of her best in <UNK> <UNK> and i <UNK> her up in out of <UNK> that these two actors came together over 20 years ago for kramer vs was definitely a very good idea the result is an excellent character drama with a theme which is still very relevant in today's society br br on <UNK> everyone has a pretty bad time though the kids seem to suffer beautifully handled by robert <UNK> in some original directing presenting some memorable scenes even the <UNK> takes on character and should be included in the cast and as for the breakfast scene with billy justin henry just simply magnificent just how do you get an eight year old to act <UNK> managed it and of course with hoffman there seemed to be good electricity the result is certainly engaging endearing and convincing justin <UNK> performance must rank among the best 5 or 6 kids' performances of all time the best thing once again was the <UNK> there was no going over the top so frequent these days br br this film came up again on the small screen the other night though i have had it in my video collection for years it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything around out of 10
<START> <UNK> starts in los angeles with jim roger <UNK> his wife alice <UNK> arguing as they drive along in the <UNK> rain unfortunately jim crashes the car his daughter heather leigh silver ends up dead while alice is turned into a wheelchair bound <UNK> <UNK> by the death of his daughter jim starts visiting prostitutes he then kills them because of voices in his head <UNK> that's it really br br written produced directed by <UNK> i hate <UNK> as a film there are some films you occasionally see that move the as it were in regard to everything you watch thereafter some films are so brilliant that all other's will be judged by it while other's like <UNK> for example are so bad that it sets a new cinematic low this is truly one of the worst films i've ever seen i am seriously surprised by the largely positive comments on the imdb although i'm not surprised the the low overall rating on the main page i not sure if i missed something but for a start <UNK> has no plot it has no story a lot of it seems almost random there was nothing in <UNK> to maintain my interest or entertain as a result became a test of <UNK> to get through to the end the film tries to be shocking with some limp scenes of sexual abuse of a rent boy by a priest there is a scene in which a disabled person <UNK> herself it <UNK> on the floor her dodgy male nurse starts feeling her <UNK> <UNK> legs underwear if anyone can find such crap entertaining then i'll just cut my <UNK> now the character's are some of the worst i've had the misfortune to know the dialogue is hilariously bad with some it sounding like it came straight from some dirty <UNK> porno of the worst kind it doesn't work as a horror as it's not scary in the slightest it's absolutely hilarious frankly insulting to claim that it is trying to be a serious drama about someone suffering a great loss attempting to cope with it overall i just think it's a pointless <UNK> badly made piece of crap from troma br br director films like some badly made documentary the special effects are terrible are of the <UNK> pour <UNK> <UNK> on our actor's face the audience will be convinced that they died a gory <UNK> variety there is no graphic violence at all apart from a suicide where someone sticks a knife in their own mouth considering the amount of prostitutes in <UNK> the nudity levels are kept to an absolute minimum br br apparently <UNK> had a budget of about 20 000 all i can say is where did all the money go oh a quick note to the filmmakers if your going to record sound live make sure you don't have your actor's deliver their lines next to a main road that half of los angeles seem to be driving up the acting sucks period br br <UNK> is in my opinion total crap it's probably not the worst i've ever seen but it's right down there i can't remember seeing such a awful film recently one to avoid unless your a <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> it's rare for a movie to both <UNK> the process of problem solving and a fantastically far reaching moral <UNK> and be a fairly accurate historical movie but fat man and little boy pulls off this trick br br it's the story of the manhattan project the world war ii effort to build the <UNK> bomb told as the conflict between the two men who made it happen gen leslie and robert <UNK> br br the historical figures are a great study in <UNK> military vs <UNK> practical vs idealistic emotional vs scientific <UNK> force vs <UNK> based problem solving <UNK> vs long term vision a fictional character played by john cusack is added as a sort of <UNK> of the two historical figures to show the humanity that oddly escapes the real people and of course the obligatory love interest played by laura dern one looking for a straight documentary might criticize the <UNK> into melodrama and occasional with the facts but that's hollywood for ya but the purpose of fiction is to <UNK> and <UNK> events into more universal truths so i think this can be forgiven br br one of the great visuals in the movie is when <UNK> witnesses the first atomic explosion it's done entirely through his reaction and considering the awesome visuals inherent in an atomic explosion it's a brave and entirely effective way of describing in a single moment the <UNK> effect on humans of <UNK> such power the sort of thing lost in the typical hollywood shoot 'em up version of history the use of music is particularly excellent in the last third of the movie br br fairly accessible and highly recommended as both a historical movie and drama of the highest order
<START> br br <UNK> beware especially american ones this has all the elements you'll hate a approach to film language a <UNK> sense of composition an intense <UNK> focus to its elegant narrative a wonderful and unusual use of music and even worse it's based on a story you'd probably hate as well if however you do feel that films don't to have derivative <UNK> be full of action and crappy dialogue don't need the visual <UNK> of mtv tv commercials then watch this it's one of my favourite films and is perhaps <UNK> most perfectly formed piece of work it's sublime like the movement of he uses <UNK> throughout the film
<START> the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style because there's absolutely no substance a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere but it never gets there br br it's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary because this film is such a totally empty experience there's lots of nice photography of a cemetery some really lame zombie effects some flashes of what might pass for <UNK> humor and a feeble <UNK> ending these elements <UNK> each other just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood there's some silliness with <UNK> heads or zombie sex to keep from screaming with boredom you <UNK> at the minimal story line and it <UNK> into ridiculous <UNK> it's like someone took several half baked b movies and tossed them in a <UNK> br br what comes out is mostly a film about <UNK> and not a good one clearly it will impress that category of art house fan who sees <UNK> as <UNK> from depth everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess
<START> well well at last a view of this underrated flick but you can't find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isn't the sound do has sometimes that terrible <UNK> and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording overall it's too dark a <UNK> of time you should say but it isn't it's a bit slow the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any when they enter the sleeping room it's full glory anyway banned in the uk since <UNK> and still on the video <UNK> list the reason is simple it's gory for their time being it really has some nasty and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed <UNK> way so every shot the image is moving things they do these days with the <UNK> the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like <UNK> in chains
<START> i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased when the show's run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes <UNK> but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
<START> a film that tends to get buried under prejudice and <UNK> it's a remake doris day is in it she sings hitchcock's second crack at 'the man who knew too <UNK> is his most under rated film and arguably a fully <UNK> masterpiece in its own right br br this is in more ways than one doris day's film not only does she give the finest performance of her career more than holding her own against james stewart but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his this is after all a film in which music is both <UNK> and plot device what better casting than the most popular singer of her generation consider day's jo <UNK> has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son this seems to be a mutual decision and she doesn't appear to be unhappy but look at the way stewart <UNK> her in the horse drawn <UNK> over her concerns about louis bernard <UNK> that she is jealous that bernard wasn't asking her any questions about her career this is clearly a <UNK> joke between them she responds with a de <UNK> that <UNK> the <UNK> of this gag suggesting that she has a certain <UNK> <UNK> about her <UNK> and that they both realise it br br after their son has been kidnapped stewart insists on <UNK> her before giving her the news this is a cruel scene brilliantly played by both actors which illustrates the power <UNK> in their marriage he is seeking to control and <UNK> her reactions in essence using his professional knowledge to <UNK> her voice in the marriage just as his medical career has <UNK> her singing career br br the <UNK> of that voice is demonstrated in the <UNK> <UNK> sequence when she has to reign in its highly trained clarity and volume to blend in with the <UNK> of female they almost act as a warning of what will become of her if she continues to <UNK> her talent at the albert hall it is her need to cry out to exercise those impressive <UNK> that saves a man's life and in the <UNK> finale it is her talent and reputation that allows them to locate their son by contrast all of stewart's <UNK> activity is <UNK> his visit to the <UNK> is a dead end he gets left behind at the church whilst everyone else moves on to the albert hall and his efforts there only succeed in getting the assassin killed thus <UNK> the police of potentially useful information it is only when his action is joined to his wife's voice in the rescue of hank from the <UNK> that he actually succeeds in doing something useful br br far from being forced into the film to give day an opportunity to sing <UNK> acts as the first musical device in the film <UNK> the nightmare that is about to <UNK> the 'the <UNK> not <UNK> to <UNK> indeed it also neatly <UNK> the way for the finale in which the close bond mother and son share through music will allow doris to save the day br br the most famous sequence in the film makes music the central feature the build up to the assassination attempt in the albert hall this lengthy <UNK> sequence may be the single most extraordinary thing hitchcock committed to film the ultimate expression of his belief that films should be stories told visually we see people conduct conversations in this sequence but we never hear a word they say we don't need to the images say everything it is also his most exquisite suspense sequence with the pieces moving slowly into place as the music builds the editing is incredibly tight matched to the music perfectly there isn't a frame out of place anything that doesn't relate directly to the assassination is giving the viewer a sense of the environment the <UNK> in which all this is playing out it builds slowly but by the end the suspense is nearly unbearable when jo screams it isn't just a relief for her but for the audience br br the <UNK> <UNK> sequence is witty and particularly effective for anyone who has had to sit through a service at a particularly stick in the mud church the <UNK> sequence seems a little flat after the albert hall one that <UNK> it on first viewing but second time around actually seems more effective with the final walk at <UNK> really <UNK> from the gorgeous use of day singing in the background reminiscent of the music as <UNK> noise in the score as a whole is subtle allowing the music from on screen sources to be <UNK> effectively br br bernard miles is a low key villain a little banal but with a dry wit he's <UNK> by brenda de as his wife who walks a fine line between sinister and sympathetic just look at the way she <UNK> a cigarette whilst her husband <UNK> the assassin her stance is pure <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the middle england exterior but she clearly has a soft side and possibly <UNK> feelings towards hank br br stewart is excellent although if hitchcock really did always cast him as <UNK> as the director's daughter seems to think then it <UNK> that hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience stewart played a <UNK> intellectual who <UNK> fascist ideology in rope a <UNK> who <UNK> his girlfriend in rear window and an obsessive <UNK> in vertigo day is nothing short of phenomenal just look at her reaction to the news that her son has been kidnapped she never <UNK> anything but neither does she sell it short this is one of hitchcock's most emotionally effective films he never lets us forget what the stakes are for the they feel the most fully human of all his central characters
<START> my brother was working at a movie theater when i saw this movie i saw it for free and still walked out i have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst when people ask me what the worst movie i have ever seen was i mention this movie in less than one second this movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set up to the next it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful if you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie okay this movie is not good bad but terrible bad if you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun like me you will not even be able to make it through this very short film please for the love of god destroy all copies of this movie
<START> i saw this movie a time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it and i got voted down i tried as best i could to get the story because some had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe that pulp fiction had been for john travolta well we can all see that he not only failed but he fell the way down this is actually the worst film i've ever seen and i've seen a great deal of bad movies it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv
<START> boring movie poor plot poor actors the movie happens in a room supposed to be in <UNK> but actually in some american city the arab terrorists are the <UNK> the blonde <UNK> is the arab terrorist damn br br there is something good about this movie though that's why the score is 2 out of 10 the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media <UNK> us every day into the real thing the terrorists are americans or western people if you like br br the movie is divided into two parts the first part of the movie concerns the <UNK> travel 15 seconds while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room 1 hour and something br br the dutch guy is going to deliver money in <UNK> to some charity organization gets off the plain takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling they will not shoot at us the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a <UNK> like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for br br good when you are so tired you can't sleep
<START> when i went to see this movie i thought that this would just be another <UNK> flick i would have to endure with my sister plus too amanda last movie was not so hot making me doubt the movie for she is the lead actress however within <UNK> i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes the jokes were not out there that it took more then a second to understand it but very funny the script was not too complex that i could not understand the love triangle but was very true to the original play by <UNK> i loved every minute of it so much that i kicked a guy two seats away from me in a fit of laughter lol very embarrassing i'd definitely advise people to see this movie especially girls as the guys in this movie are hot hot hot lol so much so that i might just get it on dvd
<START> to begin with its a rip off of the japanese film battle royal except it's missing the one thing that made br unique balls it's a weak satire at best and as far as the real tv <UNK> it attempts to comment on well everyone knows how <UNK> and stupid that genre can be so why was this film made
<START> when you think of brilliant australian comedy you don't think of skit shows although i'm quite partial to a bit of 80's and 90's full frontal or even sitcoms you think of satire something that we <UNK> really know how to do well <UNK> front line the program we know how to take the <UNK> and the war on everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well br br i've been a huge fan of chris taylor and craig for a long time i remember listening to them on triple <UNK> afternoon show they were and remain two of the funniest comedians around br br although i was sad when they left triple j i was excited to find out what they were <UNK> so much time in that made them have to leave they were doing and triple j at the same time so i figured this was something much bigger and what an amazingly hilarious show <UNK> is biting political and social satire at it's best br br i'm also pleased to say that it has recently received a much better time <UNK> than friday nights and has been moved to <UNK> nights right after and <UNK> thank you abc finally i don't have to tape it
<START> if you like the three stooges you'll undoubtedly like this 17 minute short there were certainly some amusing moments in it but like all the <UNK> work this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy and i have to confess that somehow the stooges just never really did it for me their slapstick always seemed angry rather than funny and even though it was obviously fake their antics always seemed more likely to cause hurt rather than to cause laughter in this short the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find <UNK> who is a professor of music in this a wife because he's just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marry within 48 hours of the will being read one of his students is interested but once word of the inheritance gets out there's suddenly a long line up of potential brides and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them fans of the stooges will enjoy for me it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them 4 10
<START> this movie <UNK> saw it at a <UNK> a weeks ago kinda a strange story where james franco plays this jerk who marries <UNK> miller just to get out of the country and they go to <UNK> falls for their honeymoon don't wanna give it away <UNK> the movie isn't released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens i kinda thought i would hate it <UNK> its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which i like a lot the acting is really good and <UNK> miller is totally <UNK> and plays this really sweet girl i think she should do more roles like this james plays a jerk but you end up liking him and the end of the movie is really good david carradine plays a cowboy and he is good i gave this movie a 10 because i came out of the movie really liking it and wanting to see it again which i didn't expect and my girlfriend really liked it and cried good date flick
<START> if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see this br br okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring <UNK> by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the <UNK> and subsequent destruction of the power <UNK> br br next throw in loads of human interest elements in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gun wielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a <UNK> with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator br br finally add a handful of <UNK> events to add excitement br br <UNK> if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intention br br <UNK> if you can't even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on <UNK> exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stations br br in case you didn't already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly <UNK> implausible manners that <UNK> more of <UNK> that good film making br br i'm have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed clich√© <UNK> scripts but for god's sake that doesn't mean anyone has to make them into movies br br it manages to make the <UNK> implausible 10 0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both
<START> well built doris day as <UNK> s dynamite jackson is mistaken for <UNK> <UNK> barrymore and falls in love with dancer ray <UNK> as s sam <UNK> older frenchman claude <UNK> as <UNK> also <UNK> doris what were they thinking this wildly inappropriate musical does feature ms day <UNK> singing the standard april in paris and others certainly there nothing as good as her columbia <UNK> from the time and nothing approaches day's stunning and <UNK> secret love although the material does not serve him well it's nice to see mr <UNK> performing some of the musical numbers are obnoxious br br april in paris 12 24 <UNK> david butler doris day ray <UNK> claude <UNK>
<START> apparently the writer and director of this direct to dvd slasher movie is a fan of friday 13th and other summer camp slashers this movie has everything a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called camp blood the old man who warns them not to go there and of course the crazy killer with the <UNK> who keeps on <UNK> and <UNK> at the teenagers without any reason at all the whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 <UNK> film with acceptable special effects but instead the special effects are poorly done the killer walks around as if he's out on a sunday afternoon <UNK> and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning other than that dull and forgettable <UNK> p morgan
<START> <UNK> tale of the life of charles <UNK> the first man to fly solo non stop across the atlantic in <UNK> aboard his plane the spirit of st louis br br while not amongst director billy <UNK> best films it does <UNK> some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago the story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding br br one definite <UNK> factor upon the storytelling is that <UNK> flew alone and without a radio which meant he has no one to speak with this <UNK> a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues speaking with a and the occasional <UNK> of talking to himself especially once the <UNK> sets in also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the <UNK> <UNK> for the flight br br charles <UNK> was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would <UNK> his legacy somewhat despite this he would continue to contribute to the <UNK> field and <UNK> as a <UNK> aircraft <UNK> to the us effort in wwii br br jimmy stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of <UNK> he rose to the rank of colonel in us air force during wwii and while in the <UNK> following the war would reach the rank of <UNK> general
<START> this aussie flick filmed in 1999 does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small time crooks in kings cross sydney the plot focuses on the plight of a young would be who's life is in danger after <UNK> a job for his future boss very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist the setting up of various themes central to the story is quite well done <UNK> when one is searching for bullets for his gun i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies and in this regard the movie did not offend it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown the rest of the cast did an ok job without any real stand outs that i remember the direction was very good in <UNK> in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment the main <UNK> feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short term <UNK> thinking he is <UNK> and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to <UNK> on any mistake the director <UNK> jordan deserves special mention rating in my book 7 of 10
<START> there were a lot of dumb teenage getting sex movies of the 80s and a lot of slasher flicks but there were only a handful that were made with thought made you laugh and captured the time period right this was one of them cage is <UNK> so is <UNK> who from her bio has from the hollywood <UNK> i'd love to see this released on dvd with in a special version with <UNK> by cage and <UNK> <UNK> thinking i know ever want to plan a true 80s movie weekend rent this sure thing and 16 <UNK> and breakfast club it will take you back to a totally <UNK> time which it seemed at the time was a lot more simple <UNK> to studios time to release the dvd
<START> <UNK> 3 hour adaptation of the novel by sarah waters life is tough without money especially in <UNK> london dark deeds lead to despicable <UNK> is love really just a luxury for the rich and free <UNK> cassidy as <UNK> <UNK> and sally <UNK> as sue <UNK> both give fantastic performances as the leading ladies asking this question of each other whilst rupert evans shines as the delightfully bad gentleman with great support from <UNK> mrs david mr and charles <UNK> uncle the plot twists and turns and i wasn't sure i could be led to care about characters able to hurt and use each other in this way but somehow i do care and thats because of the quality of the performances love feels like love hate feels like hate betrayal confusion well hopefully you get the idea and hopefully you will get the dvd and enjoy <UNK> cassidy is just great in this gorgeous in fact i have to <UNK> i am in her fan club hi <UNK>
<START> if there's anything worse than this movie i don't want to see it i remember so many amazing things a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy the little blond boy himself <UNK> as a god lots of stock footage of <UNK> as an ideal vacation spot shining path and <UNK> should blast away any notion that <UNK> is a vacation paradise the whole thing is so awful that plan 9 or even robot monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison this film should be bombed and and bombed again
<START> the main criticism of at the <UNK> core is that it's cheap the special effects are bad and so on and so forth yes some of the special effects are painfully bad but what a lot of folks overlook about it is that it's actually quite fun which is very important in my book br br in comparison just look at the latest star wars films they have the latest greatest special effects created by the latest technological advances which are capable in creating stunning visual effects as far reaching as the human imagination can imagine and yet with all the <UNK> <UNK> those films were as exciting as a funeral as <UNK> would say fun they're not in other words who cares if the fx aren't the greatest when the spirit of the film is fast paced humorous and clearly set on the side of action i love everything about at the <UNK> core the contrast between <UNK> victorian england vs the wild other <UNK> colorful setting of the cast of characters the concept of a lost underground world the <UNK> <UNK> the human slaves <UNK> the ugly one lol the inspired <UNK> of peter cushing who's great and doug <UNK> the excellent music it's really good cinematography by the amazing alan <UNK> and last but not least caroline <UNK> she's <UNK> sexy in this movie one of the <UNK> b movie babes ever captured on screen br br seriously anyone who doesn't like this movie doesn't know what fun is <UNK> at the <UNK> core over any turgid star wars <UNK> any time at least it has caroline <UNK> which no cgi fx can ever recreate
<START> this story <UNK> the rise of <UNK> first emperor and his efforts to <UNK> the empire was the most expensive movie production in chinese history br br it's worth every penny visually dazzling cinematography a sweeping score and outstanding characters make this one of the finest epics ever put on film foreign or otherwise please do not miss the opportunity to see this on the big screen
<START> the french <UNK> appears at the modest house of two danish sisters wet cold and alone fleeing revolution in paris she seeks <UNK> in an obscure religious community on the <UNK> <UNK> coast br br <UNK> to those who so <UNK> take her in she is a great chef an artist of food <UNK> gives herself to her adopted community through <UNK> and shared faith she leaves only when she wins the french <UNK> 10 000 <UNK> she returns laden with exotic <UNK> the <UNK> of a single meal <UNK> the birthday of the sister's father the <UNK> <UNK> br br this meal <UNK> darkly in the minds of the pleasure denying faithful but its subtleties are translated by an aging military officer who as a young man in paris learned to appreciate the <UNK> experience unfolding here the meal is the film's climax a <UNK> of love in the <UNK> artistry of food uplifting about art love and the meaning of life
<START> i liked this a lot br br the camera angles are cool it's not all <UNK> like a blair witch and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from <UNK> point of view lots of fun plenty of people were shouting at the screen br br kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions he's a lot less one dimensional than most horror heroes br br kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie <UNK> it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations there are not many twists here but it is clever and original in it's own way good creepy b movie slasher fare
<START> this film was total rubbish i was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was <UNK> they most definitely spent all their budget on the special fx rather than the script writer and director and some of the actors br br first the acting was bland and rubbish the story was not <UNK> to the audience enough rather than being from the peoples perspective of the storm the narrative was told more from government figures and the army which really isn't a way to connect to them as most of us hate politicians anyway the writer attempted to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subplot about the father and son which failed completely br br as for the directing oh god his techniques to try and create tension and <UNK> are repetitive and over the top the <UNK> up camera movements and then the sudden flash <UNK> pauses on a characters face when something horrendous has happened was pathetic br br the only reason i watched it till the end was to see the special fx which is a bad thing as special fx shouldn't make the film it should only <UNK> the story and experience there was no story br br i really wouldn't bother watching this total trash and an embarrassment to the british film industry
<START> <UNK> hits new <UNK> with this recycled trash janet plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type <UNK> cult in new guinea she hires a <UNK> guide played by robert to help her get to the <UNK> compound located in the jungle this is another cannibal movie and i probably would have liked it if not for padding this film out with scenes from his superior the man from deep river i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film which i guess makes him about as credible as al <UNK> i felt ripped off spoiler 1 2 star and that's for the <UNK> scene
<START> i watched 9 souls in <UNK> international film festival september 2006 where the director was also present and answered many questions of the audience this road film is about 9 <UNK> all very different characters from each other they decide to stay together travelling with their red van across japan every time the van stops we see these 9 <UNK> trying to escape from their past in order to build up a new life or to <UNK> a dream however no matter how hard they try it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction br br though a very <UNK> film it is not a dark film on the contrary it is full of beautiful pictures surreal elements and elegant humor heroes cannot escape their prison and they face a divine punishment for their crimes they are small pieces of a beautiful painting where the tower of tokyo depicted as a huge knife turned upside down <UNK>
<START> the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted poorly conceived poorly edited with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism br br i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb brilliant dark and beautifully shot this movie was i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here the acting was extremely thin the pace of the movie was <UNK> i gave it new chances at every turn mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny but with every new scene it dragged longer delivering characters in which i took no interest with which i could not connect for whom i could not empathize br br when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to <UNK> something like he used to date the <UNK> she dumped him and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on but here nope i know no one who worked on this film and i wish it would have been great but the film wasn't dark as some have mentioned or depressing as others have claimed those suggest that i connected with the film nope henry may long was just too long empty and tedious br br that's the <UNK> take on this one
<START> the only reason anyone remembers this steaming load of <UNK> matter is because it was scored by pink <UNK> or as they were known then the pink <UNK> <UNK> a really annoying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up with american model <UNK> and they proceed to get high and naked throughout the whole movie br br and the point of this is what exactly that drugs are bad or only heroin horse is the problem becomes that you don't give a crap about the characters and for that matter even pink <UNK> wasn't up to their best work when <UNK> at the end you are almost glad to be rid of him because he was so annoying
<START> shut the front door that's what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train okay maybe that's not exactly what i said but you get the point i didn't need to know who was in the movie or anything else all i knew was that i am renting this movie br br i probably should have asked what it was about though in retrospect i don't know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a <UNK> curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a version of <UNK> <UNK> br br anyways while the curse might be interesting on some levels well maybe not there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least killed by snakes so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little <UNK> <UNK> so she can keep her cocaine or the hispanic <UNK> that likes to occasionally stab people but then all hell broke loose and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes br br spoiler alert so <UNK> going well at the end and i'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long after all people are getting eaten so it's all good but then all of the sudden and i'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part one of the snakes is about 300 feet long then it proceeds to squeeze and <UNK> the train with all the graphic artistry of from the old <UNK> joe cartoons unfortunately i could not make a nemesis <UNK> connection with this movie anyways so you would think that a snake that big who ate a train would be pretty <UNK> well not if you know your <UNK> voodoo rocks and have the ability to <UNK> <UNK> from heaven yeah that's all i'll say about that br br in short this movie is bad really bad to the point where you might be <UNK> after watching this or your brain might hurt i didn't give this a one because no matter how stupid it was it still wasn't as bad as date movie so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies this is the one for you if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger more infamous <UNK> just walk away from the box if you see it and i'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up br br snakes can't get on a train because that's just silly not like they make stops or anything
<START> this movie felt so real i actually felt all of the emotions portrayed here during my life at various times that of both <UNK> and michael i have muscular <UNK> like <UNK> so what you see here is exactly what i've actually felt myself some won't believe there are disabled people like <UNK> full of anger and rebellion i know they exist because i'm one of them br br the story is great for a drama character driven movie the story moves fast i was never bored maybe partly because i was seeing stuff that is close to my heart but i think most people with intelligence will be glued to the screen and care about the characters the acting is phenomenal james <UNK> is perfect as <UNK> <UNK> who has muscular <UNK> he steven robertson deserves an award for his portrayal as michael connolly who has cerebral <UNK> br br michael's love isn't returned by a girl and <UNK> helps him come to terms with it i've felt this many times and the question is doesn't she love me because i'm just not the one or because my <UNK> turned her off no matter what the girl says we will always be skeptical as to the truth it's just natural and it hurts either way br br a few parts made me cry a little because it is sad and i have to face the issues myself people without a <UNK> <UNK> just cannot begin to <UNK> how it can feel this is a must see film for everyone disabled people are everywhere and greatly misunderstood this film brings a little light on some of the facts of life which are so taken for granted by the able <UNK> we want to be just like you to live on our own terms to go out to get drunk to be loved on the outside we can't do much but on the inside we're dancing
<START> there isn't much about reckless that feels right beginning with the off putting title thanks to screenwriter craig lucas who adapted his own play bringing the title along with him and continuing with the casting <UNK> <UNK> playing wife to tony <UNK> who's young enough to be her son the couple live in an <UNK> winter world that appears to be the inside of a snow globe but <UNK> gets a startling dose of reality after he admits he's hired a man to kill her she <UNK> into the night taking <UNK> with a very strange couple who want to help her <UNK> her life the production design and art direction of reckless are fine but they are services rendered for a completely inane often <UNK> screenplay it's supposed to be a dark holiday comedy though the cast is at a loss with this unfunny occasionally offensive material 1 2 from
<START> alfred hitchcock's <UNK> 1942 not to be confused with another hitchcock film <UNK> made in 1936 which has a completely different plot is not the master of suspense greatest film it dose not have the depth of vertigo 1958 nor the brooding atmosphere of 1940 and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in notorious 1946 but what it dose have is thrills adventure and a nail biting climax the two leads admittedly are quite weak it is easy to understand why hitchcock wanted gary cooper for the robert <UNK> role and barbara stanwyck for the role that was taken by <UNK> lane also the patriotic speeches that says that were written by dorothy parker have dated badly and the encounter with circus <UNK> is poorly done the beard on the <UNK> lady is clearly false however the last half hour is edge of your seat viewing the climax <UNK> the stature of liberty is very well done and the film is a clear predecessor of north by <UNK> 1959 the two villains otto <UNK> and norman lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the aircraft factory is a superb sequence this not the best film <UNK> made but it is <UNK> one of his most entertaining
<START> one of two movies i have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for even if it just to laugh at how bad it is i never found it for this movie nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects the worst movie i have ever seen
<START> chris <UNK> <UNK> like noir about <UNK> and identity is amazing from start to finish a first film is as complex as <UNK> or the <UNK> though maybe a little harder to get a handle on still it <UNK> of originality and creative drive and has a twist as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp few film makers have made as good of use of their <UNK> and attention to narrative that nolan has the story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street until he follows someone whose noticed him following others and has been following him in from there the complexity <UNK> and identities begin to <UNK> more <UNK> and <UNK> than <UNK> later work but just as razor sharp
<START> here is a movie that almost gets it all right with good performances from everyone and three strong leading performances from hanks seymour hoffman and a fine turn up from julia roberts that had me spell bound from the first few seconds these are performances that lift the production to the stars and keep it there for the duration br br apart from one or two very minor factual problems with the script the only thing that lets this movie down is the technical direction there are far too many bad cuts <UNK> continuity and a number of camera <UNK> that simply do not work this is surprising for a movie of this stature and is a little annoying to watch but it does not destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted film
<START> it's a shame that by <UNK> a <UNK> rating perhaps the audience that would find this film the most useful won't likely see it br br imaginary heroes follows the life of a teenager after his <UNK> suicide not of course the most original story in the world however it does spend a great deal of time <UNK> their parents the <UNK> that failed in their <UNK> eyes br br for teenagers who tend to put responsibility for their failures on their parents but yet refuse to accept any real responsibility on their own the movie sends a powerful message that in the end we all have our own troubles we need to deal with and that we all make our own paths br br but unlike other movies that tend to urge youth independence this one <UNK> the issues between parents and child and they become a stronger unit for it that the <UNK> child committed suicide is <UNK> but not overlooked later in the film and the responsibility by all parties for the tragedy is thoroughly explained br br although the subject matter has been covered before it hasn't been covered quite this way the film pulls very little punches now why this earned it an r rating is confusing you're unlikely to get across to a teenager in this era without being realistic but yet providing realism <UNK> that very audience br br were my junior high school class have been shown this film two <UNK> may have been prevented in this case the censors seem to have <UNK> extremely poor judgment br br 8 10
<START> hair the movie based on the broadway hit fails to achieve any <UNK> cinematic qualities you cant really take the play and make it a movie whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie it really <UNK> from the quality of a broadway show worse than seeing sitcom reruns musical fiasco and cant believe others rated it so high
<START> 28 years before 9 11 there was another 9 11 which represented a key date in the history of <UNK> south america and the whole world this was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the first <UNK> president elected <UNK> anywhere in the world and put an end to the <UNK> experiment of a <UNK> transition from capitalism to <UNK> <UNK> committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace br br unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of <UNK> rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history the times were troubled and <UNK> was a <UNK> figure in the history of his country and of the whole world true he was <UNK> elected but his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into economic crisis he was <UNK> by a coup and a right wing <UNK> followed with <UNK> and <UNK> human rights <UNK> but he was also an ally of castro who saw in his <UNK> another way of making revolution we'll never know if his <UNK> to build a <UNK> yet <UNK> society would have succeeded the authors of the movie take a completely pro <UNK> position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class <UNK> him or how his <UNK> views could go together with supporting or being supported by castro the tone of the <UNK> is nostalgic and <UNK> almost <UNK> people who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future
<START> some people don't appreciate the magical elements in <UNK> but they are what sets this series apart that and the fact the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper period clothes and <UNK> not <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> multi <UNK> <UNK> and plate <UNK> br br but i am really writing to comment on an earlier <UNK> article um michael did not leave <UNK> to do jules <UNK> there are 15 years between these two series <UNK> i agree and michael might well agree too that leaving <UNK> was not a good move but it was a <UNK> broadway role that tempted him in <UNK> and then <UNK> with its <UNK> <UNK>
<START> showtime is a funny film starring robert deniro meet the parents a <UNK> tale and eddie murphy shrek dr <UNK> the story is this in the beginning of the movie detective mitch robert deniro and another detective go into a tv store trying to bust some criminals when the cops arrive <UNK> eddie murphy a cop tries to arrest mitch not knowing he's a cop during this scene loads of funny things happen which catch the eye of tv producer chase <UNK> she is so excited about their adventures together she decides to make a tv show called showtime starring <UNK> the cop and mitch the detective but that's just the funny part the rest is strictly suspense and action there is a foreign man who is selling and making extremely dangerous guns while playing <UNK> on the show and doing it in real life deniro and murphy have quite an adventure in this story on a scale of 1 10 i give it a seven or 8
<START> just saw around here the only line they came up with to sell it is from the fx team behind independence day i think that says a great deal no talk about writers directors actors br br it's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in mid america but the storyline is thin br br all the way through the movie i kept thinking about how much this movie looks like the cut scenes from some action computer war game although the <UNK> are nice they all too often are visible much like the cut scenes in <UNK> style like br br you almost instantly know that that particular truck backdrop bridge castle or jet fighter never existed the look is smooth and nice but not up to the standard we have come to expect of action adventures today the movie is lacking a lot of obvious on location filming br br the acting storyline is below average and the <UNK> are nice but not up to feature film standard i am not surprised this thing went straight to video dvd br br
<START> back when in the states i was like about 7 or 8 i always woke early just to watch this together with a whole bunch of other cartoons like the road runner show the pink <UNK> but this was perhaps one of the most memorable and funny animated works out there and i still find it very funny today i'll never forget the episodes like the one where two <UNK> were fighting over the can of chocolate <UNK> <UNK> or the one where the is trying to reach the island where all the ants are at and my personal favorite the one where the <UNK> the and a dog end up in an animal hospital which would later be the basis of a similar looney <UNK> cartoon with <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> this is one of the most unforgettable cartoons out there in which anyone would love to <UNK> i would an excellent series
<START> you see a movie titled what are you going to think space battles with cool as heck explosions and everyone shooting at each other what do you get with this movie well you do get some space battle goodness but for a great majority of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing no one talks what is this nonsense we get a <UNK> and a ton of british computers but thats about it the main protagonist must be the worst one i have ever seen as she doesn't even have any dialog and <UNK> though scenes some of the things happening are just stupid like they use a rocket like to go to space for basic <UNK> planet side why not just use one of those nifty space ships in any case the music is almost non existent with a few boring dull lifeless <UNK> but the main thing you will notice is the <UNK> sound effects the ships use you have got to be kidding me i can also tell that the budget was low because everything looks fake which is not what you would expect from a movie especially what should be a super cool space battle movie i seriously think the budget must have been in the double <UNK> it is so bad making you laugh more than you should at how plain bad it is i am starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialog they had because their is very little here if you can't tell already that is my main <UNK> here as i probably said that like 3 times already
<START> i agree with who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating br br examples br br pierre is going to marry his cousin even though his love for her seems very cousin y br br pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship br br pierre <UNK> and seem to have a <UNK> relationship and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain br br brother is a bit of a <UNK> or is he br br and isabelle who is she really br br overall i think it was worth my time an interesting film and one that makes me want to read <UNK>
<START> this movie was talked about in <UNK> where i heard about this it was interesting to me mostly <UNK> it was direct to video and i recognized two of the stars on the cover james <UNK> of disturbing behavior and christine taylor from the craft and to my surprise on <UNK> day when i was searching through the horror <UNK> to find it on the shelf i immediately had to grab it me and my brother and our girlfriends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good the tales were interesting and for once they were actually scary unlike a lot of other horror movies being made recently some of the plot i do not understand but once i watch it again i bet i'll get it and to even more of my surprise there were other stars i recognized including one of the girls from the tv show my so called life and from the real world i'm not sure why this movie was only direct to video with a little advertising this movie could have at least made up for how much money was spent on making it the only problem i have is that since it wasn't released in theatres i guess i'll never be able to view it in widescreen you should definitely take a chance and rent this one br br
<START> i think the film makes a reference to <UNK> of <UNK> as the whole atmosphere gives me a feeling of red it seems to be that a lot of the backgrounds contain red think of the tea room f e i also think this is one of the greatest movies of the last years
<START> following which the <UNK> update goes and shoots itself through the head rather apt considering the sorry state of this movie a sequel to a film which <UNK> didn't need one br br what really <UNK> about <UNK> 2 is that the makers obviously didn't understand why the original was so good in the first place <UNK> 7 was a witty vibrant satire of bad action movies <UNK> 2 is just a bad action movie br br thin on dialogue particularly towards the tedious shoot out finale it <UNK> little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original the spoof ads now a little tasteless warning continued use will cause skin cancer seem merely there as an <UNK> and calling a new designer drug <UNK> is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the <UNK> family board game <UNK> br br the stop motion animation ¬ñ the weakest element of the original ¬ñ is used more <UNK> while this <UNK> sequel fails to include a credits sequence which makes it look even more cheap and <UNK> ah <UNK> you might say but what about the funny mayor or the way <UNK> is to <UNK> <UNK> yes these are attempts at light relief as is <UNK> <UNK> himself up with a <UNK> we're only human for the film's punchline but none are likely to <UNK> laughter like the rest of the film they're <UNK> and moronic attempts at entertainment br br the third and final film in the series <UNK> titled <UNK> 3 5 saw peter <UNK> leave to be replaced by robert john burke who does well in a <UNK> role with toned down language and violence it was an obvious <UNK> to the kiddie market a <UNK> action figure much <UNK> throughout with it's social conscience too <UNK> and new found arm <UNK> and <UNK> getting too silly the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece yet fluid direction by fred <UNK> and a flowing pace make this one <UNK> throwaway viewing br br <UNK> then is the film proper <UNK> 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle an unwatchable <UNK> of a picture a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say save for the pound signs that <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> is no paul <UNK> just as comic artist frank miller and partner <UNK> green aren't the writers that edward and michael <UNK> were a tragic waste of a good if limited concept 4 10
<START> i don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie i don't understand why high school kids should watch this i don't understand why this should have made me think about anything in the slightest br br spoiler br br when the un noticed girl is on her way to commit suicide was i the only person cheering her on the <UNK> classical music long tracking shots melancholy emotion of the film by that stage had me in <UNK> to what was intended i would have only been happy if she walked into the room and the entire cast was in there with her holding <UNK> to <UNK> their <UNK> up br br why br br cause i went to high school and frankly im sick to death of seeing movie after movie in australia with teenagers in it being solely based on terrible clich√©s i've been waiting ages for a younger person to write a movie that im able to relate to and this stereotype driven piece of <UNK> garbage is what i got instead it was like a dark version of <UNK> high that needed a predictable ending br br why are all teenagers in aussie dramas depressed or have really weird problems that just aren't <UNK> told br br on the plus side this was funnier then and i needed a good laugh
<START> i made a big mistake going to see this film that's the <UNK> of going to see films i guess after five minutes you just knew it was going to be a <UNK> and i fought quite hard to stay in my seat the old lose two hours of your life kind of feeling br br the fundamental problem is that without even mentioning the whole historical accuracy thread of reviews the script is <UNK> painful bad br br the first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible real plot development instead it <UNK> from from one <UNK> dramatic event to the next having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional <UNK> to anything at this point and that whole walking off into the sunset through the long grass field at the end what the hell was that about br br not even the excellent ed harris could save this one you could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter the most <UNK> awful one was for no apparent reason he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment she looks up it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind a lighting or am i dreaming and he says with authority in his voice br br wash me br br and she gets up and <UNK> him with a <UNK> wash me wtf that's hilarious br br and then there was the music the long extended session when it was just <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting waiting standing there <UNK> for what seems like forever and then finally <UNK> into enormous sound it was spine <UNK> wonderful and dare i say it it brought tears to my eyes br br so that is where the film picked up two stars the only part of the film where <UNK> got to say exactly what he wanted to say br br and i believed him
<START> well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though br br first off the acting was above average i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks hoffman was the <UNK> to this movie if it were not for him this movie would have <UNK> and hit rock bottom his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary he gave a good witty cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a clich√© tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen for one she is a bad actress at least to me she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing br br the directing was average to me i'm not really a big fan of the recent mike <UNK> movies and i'm not exactly impressed by this one either it was made with such a <UNK> cartoonish touch hat i could not stand the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie that is something that mike <UNK> has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record br br the one impressive part of this movie was the writing the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the writing br br well that is some of what we saw at least a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that i did like that this movie did not <UNK> everything america had done it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the u s gave weapons to the people who are now against us this movie kind of show we are too blame for that it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right overall though it was entertaining
<START> publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational well we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of <UNK> during his <UNK> of la donna mobile nor is it sensational to see <UNK> sing <UNK> in the bath it is just crass and boring what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination director van sets the <UNK> palace in a seedy swimming pool in fact he is not the duke he is just a character named so it's difficult to see why he has lots of <UNK> on and his own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lives in a <UNK> flat that is <UNK> with the orange <UNK> and <UNK> in the spotted <UNK> that is de <UNK> among avant garde directors the <UNK> sorry <UNK> ride around on <UNK> <UNK> yawn br br concepts <UNK> on an opera like this can produce unexpected and unintentional humour what can we make of the fact that <UNK> has a maid even though she lives in a <UNK> flat when the call goes out that is being taken to prison we see him being <UNK> out of the swimming pool by two <UNK> in pink shorts one <UNK> that he is going to be charged with <UNK> in a public swimming pool br br it was common for opera films to be lip 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today a dubbed opera is like soft porn you don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort the actress in role does not seem to have learned her lines properly she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing when she sings <UNK> in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly <UNK> it is difficult to tell which the sound is supposed to be <UNK> from the duke later <UNK> this by singing while engaging in <UNK> with giving a new meaning to the phrase <UNK> in the canyon br br the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a radio fairly slow <UNK> are preferred so that the overall effect is of a <UNK> in your local pub br br this is a film of a production by opera is a village in in the <UNK> they normally perform in a <UNK> in a field if i had been watching this performance in a <UNK> in a field in i would have been fairly indulgent by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide <UNK>
<START> after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film <UNK> 2 originally the film was called the <UNK> side of hell but was changed at the last minute by <UNK> pictures to <UNK> 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter by doing that it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising br br again this is from the <UNK> mouths not mine so i really can't say what is truth and what is hype br br if you look at the film as <UNK> side of hell it isn't that bad it isn't great but it is not god awful it would basically just be a b movie that likes to show boobs but as a sequel to <UNK> the film fails terribly
<START> the story line for this game is very jerky where it appears the game writers have tried to find ways to justify how a character appears in certain areas of the world map in tales of the soul that being said this is the only <UNK> i have about the game br br the beginning <UNK> is spectacular with breath taking <UNK> and interesting new devices such as the ability to create and design your own character and their own martial arts discipline there's even a second story mode which makes up for the awkward story design of tale of the souls br br parts of the <UNK> during tale of the souls is also <UNK> where you can decide the fate of your character to a certain degree which is an interesting feature br br with the many <UNK> of characters you can create the varied paths you can explore in tales of the souls and the <UNK> of swords story mode this game will keep any up <UNK> fans amused for a while
<START> awful dreadful terrible the actors are bad the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic i rented the dvd and had to force myself to watch it until the end br br my advice read the book it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams catherine has br br i think i have never watched such a bad movie
<START> i guess i do not have too much to add i found the comedy to still be funny after more than ten years since it came out br br the one thing that i did notice was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hook than it should have been the use of songs is fine during the movie but the <UNK> background is too busy too contrived and if the movie was ever to be edited for dvd i would seriously recommend that the background music be toned down to an almost <UNK> level it has <UNK> the overall feel for the whole film and i can see <UNK> why a lot of people have passed it up br br the film had a lot of levels working for it on the script plot and comedy level it is too bad that the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to enhance the mood now knowing this i find it hard to watch and i quietly curse whoever was involved with the musical editing in the film it had all the subtlety of a <UNK>
<START> i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the <UNK> court order against <UNK> moore using the name lone ranger or <UNK> his black mask at personal appearances quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality this was the absolute height of arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their <UNK> and i suspect that the lesson was well learned after this film <UNK> which was widely perceived as some sort of <UNK> for the <UNK> responsible for the court order against moore br br in more recent times it has become the <UNK> when <UNK> a legendary film or tv project to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances and rightly so show some respect you idiots and even if they turn up their <UNK> at the <UNK> which has happened at least the offer was made this is proof positive that film producers studio executives and entertainment <UNK> are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example
<START> <UNK> <UNK> austin otherwise known as is the world's second highest mountain and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed is basically a buddy flick set in the <UNK> dangerous world of <UNK> while the <UNK> photography takes in some truly awesome scenery the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore and <UNK> lies the fault with the whole film br br <UNK> lawyer taylor brooks michael <UNK> and his quiet married friend harold matt craven spend their free time rock climbing during one of their <UNK> they meet up with another bunch of <UNK> <UNK> by wealthy mountain <UNK> philip raymond j barry team are in training for a <UNK> shot at the infamous a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so during their training run however two of team get themselves killed in an <UNK> taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential <UNK> despite initial <UNK> gives them the nod of <UNK> and the pair find themselves joining his team in the <UNK> <UNK> wife cindy julia <UNK> soul is <UNK> that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb especially since he has recently become a father tensions in the climbing team <UNK> as taylor repeatedly <UNK> with another member of the group the equally <UNK> and arrogant dallas <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile himself grows increasingly ill as <UNK> sickness takes its <UNK> on his body will the guys reach the peak of or is their quest destined to end in disappointment or even death br br spends an <UNK> long time introducing its somewhat <UNK> characters <UNK> as a foul mouthed <UNK> adventurous type is especially hard to like as is barry as the hard <UNK> <UNK> millionaire but on the other side of the <UNK> craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb heck she'd be better off if he never came back <UNK> off the main characters is whose characterisation as dallas <UNK> is as campy and over the top as every other role he's ever played the story itself is totally tame and <UNK> ¬ñ just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain there's a bit of male bonding thrown in but the whole subplot about harold and his wife amounts to <UNK> and the personality <UNK> between taylor and dallas ring totally false scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by gabriel ¬ñ during the <UNK> sequences the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured i'm completely with critic kim newman on this one who hilariously stated in empire magazine on this evidence climbing can't be any harder than sitting through it quite true kim quite true
<START> it worked director christian <UNK> created a very clever action spy thriller the actors donald sutherland and especially <UNK> quinn gave a top performance what a pity that we see <UNK> quinn in others movies like this one till now he was simply the best in the role as <UNK> carlos for what he should have earned the oscar the picture was very nice the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story <UNK> let you a chance to get bored the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great believe me you will not be disappointed <UNK> why i give it 9 10
<START> i saw this at the 2008 palm springs international film festival there are some wonderful <UNK> of this film from other <UNK> here and they seemed to have really enjoyed it so i won't too far into giving a film synopsis but you could see a little of woody allen and maybe a little of <UNK> fellini in this film's collection of some 50 short sketches or vignettes strung together with no real <UNK> plot a few of the vignettes are related to each other in their character and plot lines however and a a corner bar is used frequently as a central scene where they are always giving last call the beginning and ending scenes have a common theme too that <UNK> the film it took three years to film this and much of the time must have been spent on finding the and <UNK> looking people in all of sweden to make the cast this is official <UNK> for best foreign language film for the 2007 academy awards it's a nice movie but hardly worthy of an official <UNK> for best foreign film last year official <UNK> was the very weak and the year before it was expensive looking but dull so once again sweden will have no chance in picking up the oscar this film has it's moments and would have made a good 20 25 minute short film but it gets a little old and cold for a full length feature film roy directs <UNK> is the cinematographer editor anna deserves a lot of credit for the work she must have put into this benny of <UNK> fame provides an entertaining music score it's an interesting film with a lot of dry humor and i did like it but it's nothing really special and could only give it a 7 0 out of 10
<START> in strangers on a train it's obvious from the start that playboy <UNK> robert walker has <UNK> out <UNK> granger as an unwilling <UNK> to a pair of murders <UNK> a semi public figure he's a <UNK> pro but not an especially high one high enough however for him to know that granger is trapped in a <UNK> marriage and would like to be free to marry ruth roman br br so when they meet as complete strangers on a train one afternoon walker knows enough that granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them complete strangers did commit homicide on parties that the other would be by their demise though granger is <UNK> by the idea one of the beautiful things about this film is that you can see in the performance he gives that granger just might submit to temptation br br in fact when walker kills laura elliot <UNK> wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man he expects that granger will in turn murder <UNK> father so that walker can <UNK> his estate today walker would be called a trust <UNK> baby and a pretty <UNK> one at that br br alfred hitchcock directed walker to his career role ironically in his last complete film walker died the following year with most of my son john finished hitchcock does not do too bad by <UNK> granger either br br of course when granger does <UNK> at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him the tension strangers on a train is also <UNK> by great editing first in the <UNK> match in which granger has to finish the match and <UNK> walker before he plants evidence <UNK> granger at the crime scene and also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway <UNK> between walker and granger br br strangers on a train is hitchcock at his best it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing
<START> i think this show was right on the money for me i watched it over the plane but there were parts in the movie that made me control myself from <UNK> all over the place br br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane was very believable fantastic acting on both parts i loved how diane <UNK> daughter acted in the show too she displayed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show was easy to believe as what a teenager could possibly be like in real life br br i loved this show from start to end definitely recommended for the romantic people out there
<START> this is far the most worst film i've seen this year from bollywood so far i may not lie my wife liked this film very much it was not bobby <UNK> or <UNK> what made this film become unbelievable but it was <UNK> <UNK> she performs the role of a blind woman who get in trouble when she almost fall from a mountain where luckily for her the hero <UNK> comes to rescue her in the middle of nowhere it <UNK> me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain because she cannot see her environment from this scene i started to watch the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of <UNK> <UNK> the way she plays a blind girl is very bad the only way she does that is by not to look into the eyes of the person she talks with when i saw this film i respected <UNK> <UNK> more with her performance in the movie black <UNK> will never reach this level in performing as an actress br br anyway she falls in love with <UNK> it is the clich√© story sudden <UNK> gets killed by a man who is <UNK> in love with <UNK> <UNK> is in despair but then bobby enters the movie he also falls in love with the blind girl bobby <UNK> is a great actor in my point of view but he cannot pull the film to a higher level where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it deep into the ground i must say bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he got so far bobby grew in acting from the first movie his lovely daddy gave him he was so bad in acting in <UNK> but when you see him acting now you get the <UNK> and believe every word he says only a movie with high potential like a <UNK> film has to meet his way br br okay when <UNK> also falls in love with bobby <UNK> enters her life <UNK> is not dead who believes this crap i don't why didn't they give his role to one of the ugly guys from the movie family <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> and give bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with amitabh bachchan i'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like bobby to give him a great role but he deserves so much better than a movie with <UNK> <UNK> t v face <UNK> this movie was so awful that i regret buying it
<START> it's about time kate jackson got her credit for this film i can remember watching it trying to understand it on tv my grandmother lay in bed dying from cancer i was barely 15 i didn't find out till years later that richard long had died tho i miss him on the other shows movies he was in br br i have a copy of the vhs tape still but it's not or closed <UNK> for the hearing <UNK> thats the only flaw in the movie that i can remember or know of to date i haven't been able to find a dvd or vhs copy that has sub titles in english even if someone out there knows of either copy on vhs or dvd thats or has english sub titles please let me know br br thanks
<START> countless tv displays and the memorable appearances from 4 of today's mega stars plus hope <UNK> screen debut keep still in <UNK> the plot is about a non academic research of five medicine pursuing one's crazy idea on discovering the secret of death and learn what's after death then come back to life again yet the storyline hasn't been designed as fascinating as the idea of the plot br br there are popular stereotypes to develop a regular teen slasher script in there is nelson who creates the idea of <UNK> death pretty but <UNK> rachel david who cuts the <UNK> on luckily not to be <UNK> from the school <UNK> man joe and finally the smart guy randy i did not come to medical school to murder my class mates no matter how deranged they might be they join hands altogether in an experiment where <UNK> heart will be stopped and then they decide to continue this experiment in strict confidence at night times in the campus not long after <UNK> experience everyone starts a race over having the <UNK> and the longest death experience <UNK> their lives one by one yet soon they realize their daily life becomes affected from those experiences they had the visits to the <UNK> brings back their <UNK> feelings from their childhood memories their deep <UNK> they begin having <UNK> and visual hallucinations br br when the point comes where the explanation of <UNK> director joel <UNK> <UNK> that every <UNK> has a <UNK> personality which they are not aware of this inner personality keeps one from <UNK> into identity loss if you lose or if you this <UNK> personality you certainly lose your identity instead of refreshing childhood memories i wanted to add this as a movie mistake which already has been mentioned via movie critics in the earlier <UNK> obviously here in this movie <UNK> made the actors have it least affected then why do they hesitate continuing on the experiment after learning their lesson as if death is designed by god david had been introduced as an <UNK> now he turned out to believe in god when he <UNK> a flashback from his childhood after witnessing this <UNK> change in david it's clear to see that <UNK> film was so conservative and lily <UNK> that's ultimately why it's never classified as a work of science fiction alas it had a good potential it even tried to tell the unconscious <UNK> from having a death experience beginning to believe that death is so simply natural and it's only a part of a <UNK> life br br more than what's in the movie it was also memorable to recall what's with the movie jan de <UNK> as the cinematographer who had worked almost every time with <UNK> creates an dreamy atmosphere like it's being an gothic horror movie the blue color schemes all over the walls <UNK> into the actors' faces deliver first class of lighting that suits perfectly with the film the close up shots of the <UNK> <UNK> in the campus buildings catholic <UNK> in the walls stop motion cameras and the dynamic camera <UNK> were all belong to <UNK> skills br br became a cult movie in time with its <UNK> pen portrait of the x generation juvenile especially via its futuristic editing style with <UNK> connection sequences like being part of a video music clip so much <UNK> those were the times where fast paced and multi <UNK> video music clips were on rise this style was very rare to come across in those years after its <UNK> tony scott's the <UNK> 1983
<START> <UNK> is not a classic it is a <UNK> of the wonderful original <UNK> le <UNK> directed by <UNK> and starring a much more attractive and charming <UNK> jean <UNK> if you want to fully experience the and the characters in <UNK> i recommend you don't even watch this movie and see <UNK> le <UNK> instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clich√©d and the characters <UNK> much more to reality furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to <UNK> character that you'll find the <UNK> version <UNK> although <UNK> does an almost excellent job <UNK> each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters plus the wardrobe is truly breath taking in all scenes particularly <UNK> in the last scene and at all times but also when she's on the boat frankly <UNK> is cheap as far as <UNK> go
<START> this review contains what might be a spoiler if you never read the book or saw the cover of the video box so if you want to approach the movie not knowing anything about it except that i like it a lot stop here br br the production values are not first rate but the acting between the leads is and they give the romance between them more life than does in his novel although i generally prefer the novel my very faint <UNK> to the film as opposed to the book is that the film <UNK> down some of the relationships with secondary characters and between the lead characters in a scene toward the end of the film to provide for some not at all realistic dramatic tension and as a general plot device all this is handled much better in the book with the result that i find the end of the book quite a bit more touching than the end of the movie
<START> to even say that this film is work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man <UNK> is a pathetic foolish not amusing at best yet highly popular host on french television if watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally <UNK> human being his first <UNK> lets hope only film proved to be even worst <UNK> of rape the victim fall in love with her <UNK> is not only misplaced but <UNK> <UNK> i highly suggest you not to bother taking a look at this picture or any of future features you would just loose your time there is something about french television that don't smell right and this is patrick <UNK>
<START> <UNK> a true <UNK> film crosses the border s to shows how and <UNK> really are i am an american of <UNK> and french <UNK> sick and tired of seeing <UNK> so <UNK> and <UNK> portrayed by hollywood and others br br how many of you are aware that <UNK> is the second oldest <UNK> democracy in the world after the usa or that it has a vibrant film and television industry to say nothing of ugly betty that it's capital <UNK> pop 9 million is the world capital of the book or that this beautiful city is host to the world's largest international theatre festival i hope that doug <UNK> simon mr mrs smith robert <UNK> diane thomas <UNK> the stone one day visit to see how wonderful it really is and focus on cultural <UNK> and diversity instead of producing films such as maria full of grace from which joshua <UNK> greatly for this terrific film without ever thinking through about the damage his film would help to <UNK> upon the unfairly <UNK> image of <UNK> br br anyway you will at least enjoy <UNK> very much oh and thanks imdb for your <UNK> great work
<START> look don't get me wrong i love independent films but come on i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f ing nightmare i am a punk <UNK> myself and even the music sucked the acting was crap br br i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one this one didn't even try please don't waste your precious time and money i am sorry to be so harsh but come on it dragged on and and on and on remember when the kids got into that party with the weird and the <UNK> <UNK> how did they just blend in it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a meaningful conversation with whoever they wanted i know im but my mind is just <UNK> with everything i hated about this film
<START> it only took one viewing of this dog for me to say never again it's so profoundly <UNK> that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond 1 it was awful 2 connery should have quit while he was ahead and 3 the film included a total gross out bit involving <UNK> a <UNK> through the most gruesome not to mention horribly <UNK> means possible br br actually i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of <UNK> bond films over even the worst moore or dalton <UNK> or brosnan or even david niven for that matter i personally found <UNK> and <UNK> among other <UNK> bond films to be far more entertaining than this and probably for the very same reasons why others the moore bond films namely their <UNK> humor and their <UNK> to surrender to the of the whole basic bond <UNK>
<START> i'm a fan of the old <UNK> show from the late 70's and early 80's and john candy was a major reason why he was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious unfortunately he could not get these roles to play in the movies time after time i was disappointed by the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the straight role instead of the funny guy armed and dangerous rarely tries to use john's comedic abilities or that of harold <UNK> for that matter it is simply a very predictable cops and robbers type of movie if you are a john candy or harold <UNK> fan the movie is watchable just don't expect to laugh much
<START> i loved this show such talent and i am so disappointed that it is canceled after only just beginning i looked forward to this show all week long and so sorry for the people who were hoping to be the one i would have loved to see who would have won it just began and in my opinion it should not have been canceled i hope these young artist have been viewed by talent <UNK> and have the opportunity to reach their goals i voted and sat waiting for it to come on never knowing that it was canceled and i could not believe that it was i am amazed that it had low ratings because it was in my opinion one of the best reality shows on tv
<START> another hand held horror means another <UNK> movie that fans should still seek out and make up their own minds about br br imagine a cross between the blair witch project and the grudge and you're close to the overall content of this movie it's another <UNK> horror but this time most of it is edited together in <UNK> for a video doc that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared br br i certainly had a feeling of dread while watching this movie does anyone do dreadful better than our asian friends but the creepy moments the genuinely creepy moments were sadly a bit fewer and <UNK> between than i had hoped i also felt that i was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when apparent revelations appeared throughout so i certainly can't recommend this as highly as <UNK> br br having said that it would be <UNK> of me not to highly recommend any film that goes on at length about worms contains at least two subtly spooky ghost moments and made sure that i had to put the lights back on for a while when the sun went down br br check it out if you have been enjoying some of the other hand held genre releases of late and the finale is a hair raising <UNK> br br see this if you like the last broadcast pulse angel heart
<START> <UNK> <UNK> writing and direction is really and regularly below par actually it sort of stinks aka is almost as bad as his recent horrible self serving remake of <UNK> gray absurd <UNK> dialogue among the <UNK> characters at once idiotic and pretentious amateurish stilted to its core and script and sometimes the acting is <UNK> like a school play but worse there's a sort of <UNK> self <UNK> about the direction which is just soul destroying when the director clearly hasn't <UNK> he's just no good diana quick must be cringing with embarrassment dr you should just get out of film seriously
<START> wealthy <UNK> daughter who as a young girl caught fever and now suffers from a <UNK> of breath discovers her marriage to a charming <UNK> do well was arranged by daddy whom she <UNK> refers to as darling worse than that she may in fact have only a few weeks left to live leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic rival pure <UNK> paul screenplay via <UNK> thin story <UNK> out the redundant flashbacks in the second half instead of <UNK> ahead with the plot which <UNK> the already <UNK> scenario in grim talk why go backwards when we can figure out what's happening for ourselves this is a woman's <UNK> with no faith in its target audience so simplistic is the set up dorothy <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> for most of the picture isn't a <UNK> clever heroine at all when she's upset she turns <UNK> and <UNK> upon realizing her marriage is basically a <UNK> she <UNK> away from her husband like the <UNK> virgin well that's a possibility she and van johnson sleep in separate <UNK> after all ruth roman has the film's best moments as a society shark with her trap set for van but what exactly do these women see in him johnson can be charming when it's required but put him in a melodramatic setting and he goes <UNK> too mgm production values only so so however director <UNK> tries adding some visual flavor to the flashback <UNK> and he attempts a lively pacing for the movie's initial half hour from
<START> i think i would probably not hate this movie if i spoke polish i selected the english version at the first menu but it gave me polish dialogue with english subtitles just as the polish version did maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into english very well to <UNK> the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all the acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything one scene that bothered me was when a german woman was caught stealing and as the mob was <UNK> her around her shirt opened and the director showed close ups of her naked breast for the next 15 20 seconds i couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience much of the film takes place in an <UNK> camp <UNK> by the americans first the american uniforms did not look anything like u s army uniforms second none of the <UNK> camps in <UNK> were <UNK> by the americans i would think that a polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an american born in 1966 that all six <UNK> camps were <UNK> by the russians all in all it's just not a very good film if you don't speak polish
<START> okay i'll admit right up front that the cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market seen today the huge <UNK> and very stereotypical is not politically correct however the cartoons were well made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of <UNK> prologue such as the one with leonard <UNK> they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd in other words throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history plus little black and other racist cartoons are out there especially on the internet br br this cartoon has our little hero out hunting at first he's chasing a cute little <UNK> but later accidentally happens upon a lion a lion that is more than happy to make his dinner however through all this a weird appears again and again and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story br br cute well made and clever i like the cartoons plus i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin skinned liberal friends just to watch them have <UNK> fits or even heart attacks loads of fun folks
<START> the other <UNK> girl not to be confused with the book it claims to be based upon this movie is not even close to a faithful adaptation i could understand them changing or <UNK> on a few things the book is not perfection but it was well written and became very popular i could understand if the bbc wanted to make this a little more faithful to what actually happened who anne <UNK> really was but it's not even close to being historically accurate either it's just fluff mindless made up fluff a real shame br br to begin with the writer and director seemed to think it was a good idea to setup the story like it was a reality tv show seriously they have the sitting in front of the camera <UNK> how they really feel about what's happening in their lives anne <UNK> sits in a <UNK> not the church kind the real world kind and chooses what she wants to tell and what she wants to just sit and smile about she looks stupid having to use such a modern cinematic device in a film set in the <UNK> it's the real world <UNK> england br br may is a very good actress and after 'the and 'a turn of the i was becoming a real fan of hers but she should never have been cast as anne actually i think she would have been a better mary <UNK> <UNK> was a poor choice she's a good actress sure but she has very modern features and does not appear convincing in period costume honestly i spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if she was that girl from 'the truman show ' she was she's also too old to play the teen aged mary so for some unknown reason they made mary the oldest of the sisters it makes no sense i know it's like the bbc seemed to forget that these people actually lived they're <UNK> the story around and making things up left and right i feel ridiculous having to correct the bbc on historical inaccuracies but really br br apart from the two sisters the rest of the cast was actually very well chosen steven <UNK> struck me as a brilliant choice for george and his casting was the real reason i decided to seek out this movie big mistake he does a great job sure but he's hardly in this how can anyone pretend they're adapting the other <UNK> girl and hardly mention george <UNK> that's just absurd philip was another very good casting decision but yet again was hardly in the finished product br br the real problem with this is the script there's just no getting around that it's bad it's really really bad it's too melodramatic and not engaging anne is portrayed as an air head mary as the <UNK> and george as the <UNK> <UNK> first husband is hardly mentioned her relationship with the king is never explained they simply do not tell the story gregory wrote the whole thing comes across as a great big waste i have no desire to see this thing a second time i guess i'll just have to read the book again and hope that the natalie portman version due out next year will be much better br br note as of this writing the only way of <UNK> this miniseries in the usa is on the last disc of the miniseries 'the six wives of henry <UNK> ' that's a great miniseries but can cost 50 to 60 and that's way to much to spend if you're just looking for this piece of garbage
<START> a good cast a good idea but turns out it is flawed as <UNK> is not allowed as evidence in <UNK> so many good actors and they are all acting so badly so why did they all get attracted to this mess and yes it has its good points such as lighting etc but ultimately i wondered two things how could so much talent lead to such a bizarre mess what is that accent that <UNK> <UNK> is putting on he is was a great actor and so what is that accent all about it is impossible to identify what was he trying to do maybe it is his subtle indication as if to say to us <UNK> got involved with a turkey so here's a crap accent to go with it '
<START> <UNK> may have a good reputation but since we now that many of his best films were in fact directed by the late great mario <UNK> it's clear that he wasn't one of <UNK> most gifted filmmakers back in the seventies this film pretty much proves that as despite the simplistic plot it's a <UNK> mess and overall i'd even have to go as far as to say that tragic ceremony is worse than insipid giallo effort the <UNK> with the tongue of fire apparently <UNK> this movie and i certainly don't blame him the plot simply follows a bunch of kids that run out of <UNK> in the middle of nowhere they happen upon a house while searching for fuel but it turns out to be a bad choice as the owner is just about to conduct a satanic ceremony ho hum the film features a lead role for <UNK> keaton who would go on to star in the exploitation classic i spit on your grave some years later but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talentless performers the film features one decent gore scene towards the end but this really isn't enough considering that it takes <UNK> minutes of tedium to get there i have a high tolerance for rubbish italian films that don't make sense but even i couldn't stand this one miss it miss nothing
<START> perhaps not miyazaki's best work but i couldn't help but love it to death a five year old boy finds what he thinks is a <UNK> stuck in a bottle he saves its life and keeps it in a bucket as a pet but it really is a magical being the daughter of a human wizard and a sea <UNK> as the boy names her is taken back to the sea by her father who tries to <UNK> her from returning to land and becoming human but she gets into his magic <UNK> and does what she wants to do the story is simple and cute where the film really comes alive though is in its tremendous artwork the drawings are more child like than in any of miyazaki's other works but there's beauty in its simplicity as with all of his films miyazaki creates this world of imagination that i was just so in awe of seeing it in the theater brought back memories of what it was like when the opening notes of jo <UNK> score for princess <UNK> washed over me and gave me <UNK> just short of a decade ago the score here is equally as wonderful i wanted to live in this world and never leave it
<START> opera opens with a very close up shot of a <UNK> ever watching eye and thus begins one of <UNK> most bizarre and enjoyable features my second favorite in fact behind deep red granted at times the movie is pretty absurd the lack of real concern after murders the bird attack the burnt <UNK> that <UNK> but this is <UNK> <UNK> world and once you come to terms with that you'll find that it works i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them for example the aforementioned bird attack is completely over the top in theory yet look at the wonderful execution of it <UNK> flying in chaos adding their <UNK> <UNK> to the driving rock beat the crowd in panic as seen through the <UNK> <UNK> eye view camera work and then the focused attack <UNK> of terror indeed <UNK> amazing flowing cinematography is on full display in opera and clearly one of the film's highlights i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music a nice contrast of music with each used effectively the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very <UNK> feel the sound effects deserve a nod too stabs <UNK> and all br br inspector alan <UNK> i've seen a lot of your movies yes you're really an expert in this field i'd be very interested to know your opinion br br <UNK> i think it's <UNK> to use movies as a guide for reality don't you inspector br br inspector alan <UNK> depends what you mean by reality br br being that this is a giallo stylish murders are a must and <UNK> does not disappoint the bullet through the door scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot if you'll forgive the pun the black <UNK> deep voiced <UNK> <UNK> cool shots killer is cold and brutal and having him tape <UNK> under our <UNK> eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch that all said as a giallo opera doesn't quite have as good of a mystery as it should the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there's little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders this and the strange ending could've used more work despite these problems though opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film br br one final note it was nice to see a movie for once show the correct view through <UNK> just a circle not two circles together nice eye for detail <UNK>
<START> while <UNK> engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the <UNK> obvious satire <UNK> <UNK> on comes off as forced and ultimately <UNK> with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release <UNK> 9 11 before the 2004 <UNK> and the real tragedy of <UNK> film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have <UNK> the further in 2006 mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as <UNK> compelling or as it did then br br frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham <UNK> zombie flick has questionable intelligence br br and if you didn't notice michael moore didn't exactly help to defeat bush br br there was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies
<START> this is in simple terms one of the worst films ever made the story goes way beyond being tasteless and judging by the actors performance they know it there just in not one single quality of this film patrick <UNK> will have to overcome some major obstacles in his career before people forget about this turkey
<START> i can understand how barney can be annoying to some but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous barney was made simply right from the beginning and simplicity isn't bad especially for the young ones he entertains i personally find this show to be very underrated period barney friends is a very educational show in my opinion and even 17 years after its debut and nearly 21 years after the character's debut on home video he proves time and time again that he still appeals to young children maybe less so than in the early 90's where barney was the hannah montana of the time but he's still a classic as a fan of barney myself i feel that i should defend him in a way that doesn't seem like <UNK> the way the purple guy teaches things may be very simplistic and unrealistic but would you rather have them hearing about war be thankful some one a <UNK> dinosaur but still is there to comfort kids and let them be kids simply in this day and age i feel that we rush our kids to grow up and barney is there to say you can still be a child at heart in addition many of <UNK> lessons on current episodes about <UNK> being honest and yes even death could appeal to everyone not just his target audience besides our children need to learn to be kind and respect others for who they are and he helps them do that in short barney may be annoying to some people and i completely understand why but cut him some slack all he and his friends along with hit entertainment his production company are trying to do is help kids not only learn necessary skills but to have fun and to also look at the positive parts of life if more people listened to their children's favorite character and viewed him through their eyes maybe we wouldn't be so negative about him and possibly life itself
<START> when i was young i'd get up early every saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called <UNK> fu theatre ' it wasn't as if these films were works of art it wasn't as if these films all came from china japan korea or any country in particular if the story had to do with fighting ¬ñ be it <UNK> or <UNK> ¬ñ and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any american gym class then that was good enough it wasn't as if they were really even very good they were just great action flicks with incredibly over dramatic music where the hero <UNK> his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys and then the credits would roll br br sword in the moon is much like these films of my youth arguably a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> given a welcome twist by the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher ' he kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the <UNK> <UNK> the chief bodyguard of an emperor who <UNK> his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service however an equally <UNK> rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> agrees to find these rebels and kill them his task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are <UNK> a friend from his past and his former love <UNK> br br sadly sword doesn't have much to <UNK> itself from other action films some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended while the atmosphere and story tend to <UNK> toward a dark mood the tone is almost sacrificed to the never ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc what should've been a quick and easy action film gets <UNK> down by far too much personal <UNK> and the film suffers as a result br br i've read that this film marks <UNK> first real <UNK> into the world of art house action pieces along the likes of <UNK> tiger hidden dragon next time i'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more and a little less <UNK> '
<START> i could not stand the woman who played the mother i wanted her to shut up she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying i love you i hate you the bank is my dress is on fire was this actually filmed in ireland the sun <UNK> throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the <UNK> i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002 the summer in a century most everything was still <UNK> if the <UNK> in ireland could only <UNK> during long dry stretches then the country would have <UNK> hundreds of years ago it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at <UNK> club
<START> i always knew the day was coming we all knew there's only so much oil in the ground and one day we'll run short but isn't there supposed to be enough coal to use instead and wind power or something things for future generations to worry about br br then this documentary hit me <UNK> between the eyes oil makes the <UNK> that is the reason for the first time in world history practically no one lives on <UNK> when the inevitable oil <UNK> hit a lot of things air travel many drugs <UNK> life in the <UNK> will become impossible but the <UNK> insight from the documentary is this oil gives us so much energy with so little effort that without it our lives must change even if <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> immediately at best they'll smooth our landing into a strange post oil world which the documentary claims could be starting now br br despite its gloomy message the documentary is often highly entertaining it contains fabulous historical footage sober images of dark urban <UNK> and campy funny stuff from the 1950's which reminds us of why we moved to the <UNK> in the first place it also offers hope that a massive effort started now could both ease our transition from oil and make the world a better place br br my only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are finding this stuff out now how can this be a big <UNK> all of a sudden we knew in the 1970s we should be preparing for a post oil world and we started to prepare with alternative energy research and smaller cars if our failure to follow through on president jimmy <UNK> 25 years ago has doomed us to a hard landing in a post oil world why was no one shouting about it on br br in the end i found the documentary highly <UNK> and it left me with the terrible chill of being dragged out of a very lovely dream this is must viewing for everyone not afraid to face a very likely near future that we still have time to do something about br br charles
<START> i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown the interest <UNK> early a simple premise in scenery five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there let alone know how in the hell they got there confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and <UNK> the men learn that a <UNK> is on his way with plans to kill his <UNK> now the men size each other up trying to <UNK> if all are victims and who may actually be one of the <UNK> the cast includes jim <UNK> greg kinnear joe <UNK> bridget <UNK> barry david <UNK> and adam rodriguez
<START> without doubt grand champion has the most impressive cast of <UNK> level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun g rated family adventure this is a must buy for every video collection director barry <UNK> combines the drama of the <UNK> <UNK> competition for the grand champion cow with a touching and funny story of <UNK> against difficult challenges joey lauren adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well <UNK> mother but the star of the show is 12 year old emma roberts whose on camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt julia you can expect a lot from this young roberts as is already proving itself in her new hit <UNK> series
<START> andy <UNK> the independent movie maker from new york directs this little treat as his version of the <UNK> todd legend <UNK> <UNK> the throats of customers in his <UNK> and his <UNK> mrs <UNK> turns them into meat <UNK> <UNK> i was well informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty <UNK> for my money has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all time race ed wood looks like orson welles in comparison this movie is so bad in oh so many ways let's take <UNK> direction for starters the film quality is grainy the sound quality is grainy many scenes look as if <UNK> was using a camcorder to film the credits say <UNK> and directed by andy <UNK> he wants to take credit for <UNK> showing up after a death scene how about the atrocious musical score selected for the film the film cuts with one poor transition after another little logic is used in the creation of the plot the story has little to do with the actual legend of todd the murder scenes are <UNK> but not horrifying in any way hands legs and other <UNK> are cut with the skill in which the editing was done <UNK> and let's take the breast in the pie scene yes it is in there the pie maker didn't know that an entire breast with <UNK> filled an entire pie <UNK> later we hear from our characters that they have been careful not to get caught for the 200 plus murders they have done obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep <UNK> of what is going on sorry it was too <UNK> the actors are not too terribly bad to be honest some even have <UNK> of talent and all seem to be genuine english <UNK> many non erotic nude scenes are forced throughout <UNK> seemingly has some issues regarding sex plot <UNK> are left <UNK> the ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work i could go on and on did i like anything about the film not much to be truthful i have a high level of acceptance for films of this <UNK> in terms of low budgets and <UNK> talent but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick
<START> i loved this film it manages to make the characters sympathetic well most of them concerning the problems they have with their relationship br br gloria <UNK> as <UNK> is in a dusty marriage with a husband who barely notices her presence though he does notice her absence the film shows very well why she is tired of married life and why she is <UNK> to a sweet talking con man without making her selfish or demanding the reaction shots of <UNK> at the dinner table on her <UNK> while her <UNK> husband late to dinner again eats <UNK> with gusto and pushes bride and <UNK> dolls out of the way of his plate are perfect br br the show is stolen and stolen effortlessly by elliott <UNK> as jim <UNK> <UNK> husband after losing <UNK> to another man jim literally <UNK> up his act <UNK> off his mustache working out to lose the middle aged spread and dressing neatly there are several shots of jim at home lonely and thinking of <UNK> including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet the film gives the audience the advantage of watching <UNK> transformation along with <UNK> it isn't just the exterior that's more attractive we come to know much more about the kind of person jim really is and we see how completely different he is from <UNK> second husband <UNK> cody <UNK> shines as the before and after jim who is determined after discovering true character to win <UNK> back if he can the film's most touching moment comes when jim and <UNK> discover that they are standing under the and jim talks of what he has lost br br definitely worth watching
<START> first i don't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any awards compared to la <UNK> which is also on a best list la <UNK> is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much the lead actor was annoying i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was bored even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting i wanted it to end as soon as possible why did it have to be his sister and cousin ugh and why did get mean he just turned mean and also was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in i mean this in all seriousness but does incest happen a lot in french culture european culture i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that
<START> i saw this at a test screening in <UNK> a week or so ago and went with a bunch of my girlfriends we all really loved it a lot james franco is amazing and so hot i would see it just for him but <UNK> miller is also really good and plays a southern girl who is in love with him so much that she can't let go david <UNK> who was in kill bill plays a cowboy and he is perfect for that the story is kind of strange but if you believe in the power of love and magical things you will love it it is really original and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot but by the end it gets more serious and we all ended up crying i am going to see it again with my friends as soon as it comes out it is really good
<START> why take a perfectly good original drama based on a perfectly good novel and remake it as a quasi musical and cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent somewhat akin to <UNK> or the two most recent star wars films lost horizon is full of unintentional laughs who can forget sir john gielgud smiling <UNK> in his <UNK> outfit <UNK> an <UNK> dance to the <UNK> party family br br or sally <UNK> <UNK> lovingly to george kennedy doing her best cher impression as she <UNK> from one rock to another every little thing you do and my favourite bobby van <UNK> the strength of america's education system question me an answer i can't wait for the dvd release as hopefully it will contain comments by <UNK> who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film
<START> i went to watch this film with my family who were expecting a neatly <UNK> story like mrs and they returned home thoroughly disappointed so this is a warning to all story to stay away 15 park <UNK> does not seek to answer questions or provide moral <UNK> on how to treat the mentally challenged rather its intention is loud and clear it questions every human <UNK> sane or not sense of reality in fact for me it even <UNK> doubts about my taken for granted sense of sanity the security bondage satisfaction that i find in my present is it really what i am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes <UNK> <UNK> on to just to <UNK> <UNK> the neglected which exists in all of us in some way or the other so why does <UNK> so <UNK> makes it a point to show off her strength of mind when she is really <UNK> by the realization that she is becoming a monster aren't we all who think we are really monstrous and <UNK> vulnerable about it deep down inside is it not better to be happy even insanely than to create the impression of while <UNK> one's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sincerely does that and society <UNK> her as the ending did <UNK> me at first but then you realise that bravery and sincere belief took her where she wanted to go she found what she was searching for not caring what society had to comment upon her search and it is the seemingly <UNK> people <UNK> the psychiatrist and <UNK> who never reach anywhere my family thinks that i am <UNK> too in trying to make sense of a film that is largely to the rest of the world anyone else willing to believe in my sense of reality
<START> i can't believe i even tried to watch this filth as an avid b horror movie fan i was more than <UNK> at the <UNK> of this film by popular budget horror filmmaker <UNK> gordon lewis unfortunately right from the opening of the film i could not for the life of me think of a worse movie than this well maybe <UNK> but i firmly believe dr gore the body shop is worse when i think about it a horrible plot that moves incredibly slow the movie drags on with no real horror to speak of however i will admit to the pure hilarity of a couple scenes when dr gore is his soon to be victims the camera <UNK> in on his overly large <UNK> eyes while the whole time there is this purely <UNK> soundtrack to add to the amusement i laughed for the better part of 10 minutes after he his miracle woman the movie wastes away nearly 20 minutes just showing him and his girlfriend as he is teaching her to speak then they talk <UNK> among have <UNK> etc unfortunately there is only music playing during this whole <UNK> with no speech whatsoever this portion of the movie will leave you wishing you had <UNK> your <UNK> with the dull edge of a <UNK> knife i almost want to <UNK> at the very thought of this movie if you like movies that are bad watch this one
<START> if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes it's over as far as i'm concerned this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense a good movie has to start and end strong it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise but ultimately muddled and irrelevant there are so many other movies from asia to watch many of which i am sure most of you have not seen that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film
<START> additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases this australian made film shot in new south <UNK> is <UNK> for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that <UNK> uses up its <UNK> budget and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed below standard post production finishing and <UNK> cutting <UNK> the affair tom <UNK> plays as howard anderson an american <UNK> with a passion for building who is in process of a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region all the while unaware that his business partner julian guy has <UNK> the <UNK> structure for ten million dollars far more than its actual worth and plans its destruction as <UNK> to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud in line with this <UNK> scheme <UNK> for an <UNK> to perform the <UNK> deed a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of <UNK> daughter and due to the future being in the midst of a critical fire <UNK> <UNK> one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay julian has every expectation that his <UNK> design will come about without serious <UNK> as the local insurance firm <UNK> by the crime is majority owned by the naturally skeptical <UNK> of london <UNK> senior investigator george james mason to <UNK> into the nature of the made more sinister because of the death possibly a homicide of an insurance investigator wendy hughes who in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the <UNK> the setting for the film is the week before christmas of summer in the <UNK> a dramatic background but the <UNK> within the story are not smoothly <UNK> resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow a problem <UNK> by <UNK> editing the mentioned heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality <UNK> semi <UNK> and <UNK> style is <UNK> by this dim sound <UNK> but mason is very effective as ever and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written out investigator wins acting <UNK> with his performance as the <UNK> julian
<START> <UNK> the terrible is more a filmed stage play than a big screen <UNK> citizen kane a similar work in many ways is quite the opposite in the way we come to expect such fare in that it has lots of location shooting for example br br acting is meant to convey a character's motivations and thinking to the audience if it succeeds in making you understand the character what does it matter how it was done and considering the low amount of action how else is one to express events that influence the story and consequently the characters' <UNK> and decisions other than exaggerated movements br br as well there's a historical level why the acting style should not surprise the rise of <UNK> <UNK> in germany and <UNK> forced film makers who stayed behind to make films the way they knew how as they were prevented access to more modern works that showed <UNK> evolution and techniques they only used what they knew br br the <UNK> control of government in germany destroyed the great german film industry of the <UNK> due to their total control over that film industry and propaganda films can only entertain german troops so much hence the need for popular german silent films of the <UNK> for example so a lot of <UNK> the terrible film's techniques would have been derived from such captured german films <UNK> to the film crew as mentioned in other comments br br there was no confusion anywhere and though personally it was found over hyped it is by no means a bad cinematic experience and definitely not amongst the worse films ever the acting is fine and part of the cinematography excellent even by today's standards more below definitely not a popcorn flick one can't leave their brain outside this one's door dated perhaps and very symbolic only worth watching on the big screen if one is unable to view the films with the lights off at home for many of the cinematic elements will be lost in these <UNK> <UNK> b w experience it all depends upon what expectations one walks in with br br warning spoilers do not read the following comments in case they influence your personal view of the film s br br and if one does not mind the obvious communist propaganda as opposed to <UNK> propaganda for <UNK> is how <UNK> saw himself obvious in his influence on the film's direction see other comments and anyone with a world historical awareness outside the us perspective will definitely understand this maybe <UNK> was an earlier incarnation of <UNK> or maybe not this is more a <UNK> on <UNK> and his motivations decisions loneliness <UNK> of <UNK> etc using the persona of <UNK> than any true historical record of <UNK> also note the obvious use of particular colours in the sequel red for the <UNK> in the <UNK> scene and perhaps blue for the usa during certain shots when the <UNK> wears the crown br br but it has many excellent visuals such as the profound use of shadows or the exterior shot of the <UNK> coming to beg return to <UNK>
<START> notable only as the acting debut of future big time hollywood <UNK> sandra <UNK> this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect <UNK> <UNK> the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out the production values stink of cheese in fact a total lack of production values would have been better at least the film might have seemed <UNK> that way the <UNK> is laughably bad and <UNK> present in the film it's <UNK> as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used br br the performances are for the most part horrible though there are a few exceptions in those exceptions however the performances are <UNK> by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times i e characters going from passive to <UNK> in the blink of an eye bad direction also the constant weapon sound effects magazines being loaded <UNK> being <UNK> etc are completely <UNK> and more often than not totally out of sync with the on screen actions add to this cheesy bad guy vocal <UNK> for the lead villain mainly so that you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film and you have a recipe for disaster br br the situations in the film go well beyond standard suspension of disbelief and become downright laughable one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the <UNK> knife <UNK> in his <UNK> in order to free himself so my questions are why didn't he do this sooner and why does he even have the <UNK> knife he wasn't searched right this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been <UNK> into this 90 minute package br br in whole the plays like an <UNK> bad r rated tv movie from the '80s if not for the subsequent success of sandra <UNK> this would have never found its way to dvd but it has so my only advice is to steer clear watching this film may actually your iq
<START> for me late was interesting not only because it was my first film of i completely enjoyed but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work i've seen this doesn't mean innovative editing in the way godard would introduce it with breathless in 1959 but quite the opposite br br the editing was as <UNK> as in the best of hollywood films from the 30s 40s but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story unlike them it never <UNK> <UNK> anything or tried to make itself invisible but together with the cinematography made me feel like i was traveling on a gentle stream constantly feeling the waves beneath me like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost <UNK> <UNK> of a cradle in this sense the film was comparable to <UNK> and work but somehow even more subtle br br what was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself similar to the remarkable camera work in <UNK> <UNK> 1954 or 1943 which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us br br i feel that editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films <UNK> the stories significance beyond the obvious the wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either i found the story itself to be rather conventional br br the narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way and i thought that the first half of the film was setting up a <UNK> ingenious spectrum of emotions and <UNK> unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather <UNK> and and formulaic compared to the set up though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other less complex film somehow i felt that he failed a bit in trying to <UNK> the many layers he had woven maybe he should have kept them intact this criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film especially since the <UNK> is again reminiscent to the way <UNK> dealt with the plot in his films unfortunately i haven't yet the feeling that was able to elevate the story and its characters in his <UNK> conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion the best efforts i have seen to date floating clouds 1955 and scattered clouds 1967 <UNK> the energy he had built throughout the narrative while delivering poignant and <UNK> endings br br this is already more than most director's are able to do and in my opinion the basis for a real <UNK> of the cinematic medium in this regard and considering the <UNK> of the last two films i've seen by him he may have already become one of my favorites br br the only problem i have at the moment is where i'm going to see more of his films on the big screen
<START> i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic but i dont only own 1 i actually own 2 its that good br br well when i say good i mean bad but i will try to do a <UNK> review i even watched a which one of the other reviewers here mentioned to compare it to this and born a ninja is actually worse but not quite as funny br br and is this ever funny everything about this movie is poor everything the plot is absolutely stuffed note the need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your <UNK> every action sequence is stuffed too our hero is more than a hero he can stab people with <UNK> take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 <UNK> away without even bleeding and tie a rope up to a tree which when an enemy steps on it ties a <UNK> around the enemies leg picks him up and throws him 50 <UNK> into a bunch of <UNK> br br the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it but it should have you rolling especially <UNK> out of the ground and <UNK> at the bad <UNK> oh yes and the bad guys somehow it seems they <UNK> themselves 5 times each in the movie perhaps it's just that there weren't enough actors but in a movie of this <UNK> i doubt that br br the <UNK> is about how was a soldier in the vietnam war and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his <UNK> the colonel just happens to pick up then fights back this is just the excuse for a rambo clone with most of the movie being <UNK> soldiers and i really cant explain the plot any more <UNK> there is nothing else to the movie it still rocks though br br what else could be wrong you ask dont get me started hand <UNK> which actually go off at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match scenes where there are 5 people chasing then the camera cuts away and back and there are 7 the way that every time loads the <UNK> <UNK> he is against the same background even though he is in completely locations and the worst part is when pushes the plastic <UNK> onto the enemies and one enemy is completely <UNK> by the <UNK> so he doesn't know what to do so he half <UNK> dies without even being touched it's ridiculous br br but funny very very funny this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody <UNK> if you dont find it funny you are 1 in a million and for the rest of us it's magic
<START> tacky but mildly entertaining early 90's soft core comedy features <UNK> sarah <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and nicole posey as three outer space teenagers parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days following some <UNK> <UNK> from her friends <UNK> agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride the end result they wind up running out of gas in space and crash land on planet <UNK> 45 aka earth meanwhile teenagers dave michael todd davis and jerry ken <UNK> have come to california to stay the summer with <UNK> uncle bud joe <UNK> a beach bum who lives right on the beach the three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch uncle bud is about to be thrown out from his soon to be condemned beach pad thanks to sally <UNK> <UNK> who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with bud she's also a bikini <UNK> and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of 30 000 exactly what bud would need to fix up his property so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him and that's about it folks that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras <UNK> their half naked bodies in the <UNK> sun oh and lets not forget the sex there's quite a deal of it before i go any further i need to put this movie in context it was released in 1993 long before the <UNK> of such soft core <UNK> such as surrender cinema and seduction cinema compared to these newer <UNK> more explicit movies the soft core movies of the 90's sure seem somewhat mild when beach babes from beyond first came out in 1993 from the full moon <UNK> entertainment it was <UNK> as the debut release of a label that <UNK> in mature audiences type films to say the times have changed this particular film genre has gone from a few steamy but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally <UNK> to venture into the realm of hardcore looking at beach babes from beyond again after viewing it upon its release it's safe to say that if this same film were to be made today there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog as for the sex scenes themselves they tend to run hot and cold three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening so each couple gets a soft core scene complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting they're really not that horrible and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots especially the scene between <UNK> and jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer but the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity occurs quite early on in the film sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool all of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous but <UNK> fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her <UNK> body in a <UNK> and then again when walking away from her bath walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude <UNK> up guy in the waiting we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back it's good that back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good <UNK> <UNK> spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other <UNK> scenes no dark lighting or annoying slow motion here just two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all <UNK> body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does it's really the only time where beach babes from beyond truly delivers the goods but even without this spectacular scene i am mildly <UNK> this film just for the fact alone that it's fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade
<START> so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see it's up there with <UNK> and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years why does the camera make old school kung fu noises when it <UNK> why does that random guy stuff a <UNK> <UNK> plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die what is this <UNK> dracula <UNK> who cares just laugh at it this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really ron <UNK> range of emotions are always off he looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag the special short bus kinda special effects are randomly placed and never needed most scenes are lit with a desk <UNK> if they are lit at all mel novak has the <UNK> to look off camera for his line and it's not even edited out they just keep on filming in fact half of this movie isn't even on film at all it's 1 2 film 1 2 <UNK> hand <UNK> for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain but oh do i love it thank you ron hall for this cinematic abomination i went out and bought it cause it's just so damn funny 1 99 on amazon and i had it rush delivered br br i have weapons i have weapons i have weapons
<START> spoiler alert br br the point is though that i didn't think this film had an ending to spoil i only started watching it in the middle after matt had gotten into <UNK> body but then i became fascinated by the <UNK> of the plot even for a channel 5 movie and couldn't possibly see how matt end up happy what about his <UNK> at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend surely <UNK> and wrong and then the whole thing does not work as a touching buddy buddy <UNK> <UNK> just ridiculous so was going <UNK> he can't just come back to life and yet how can he live as a woman ' and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all what's that about i was so cross wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all but was one of the funniest films i've ever seen so <UNK> and
<START> there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early <UNK> of zombie movies i may get to watch another one revolt of the zombies 1936 before the month is out for all star john <UNK> intention of building an army in the service of the third <UNK> with them they are not seen to do much at all james uncle <UNK> from song of the south 1946 plays their leader who also serves as <UNK> <UNK> black comic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> role from king of the zombies 1941 as does the <UNK> named <UNK> <UNK> wan as <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately for carradine his supreme achievement ¬ñ the <UNK> of his wife ¬ñ brings him all sorts of trouble not only do her relatives turn up at his remote <UNK> lab to <UNK> into her sudden death which means he has to fake a funeral service but she actually proves <UNK> and <UNK> eventually her fellow zombies to rise against their master also involved is cowboy star bob steele still best known for his bit in howard <UNK> the big sleep 1946 who plays a u s secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff thankfully director would have much better luck with his next genre effort the day of the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it ends with the <UNK> that the film you have just seen was an <UNK> at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an <UNK> was an good movie and <UNK> at <UNK> genius once again of course cassavetes told some guy it wasn't really an <UNK> per se on his <UNK> so it's the story about a light skinned black woman <UNK> who passes for white and her family another passing for white brother named ben and a black black brother named <UNK> when she falls in love with a white jerk named tony he is <UNK> surprised when he finds out she's black and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings <UNK> is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure still hopelessly depressed over tony and ben is <UNK> and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale <UNK> of existence overall i suppose it's really about <UNK> vs change in human life i suspect that cassavetes had the plot organized enough and it was just the dialogue that was improvised the dialogue itself is very uneven sometimes somebody will say something very memorable other times it's <UNK> awkward what's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' <UNK> of their characters cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do shadows <UNK> in the ears of the ten best students and this was the result the guys playing ben and <UNK> are very good at first i didn't like <UNK> but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds not necessarily the best with small talk shadows is <UNK> by many as the <UNK> of the indie film movement made in 1959 and it's definitely recommended
<START> it's wartime drama wwii with french and jews and germans but this one is somehow fun <UNK> so director jean paul co wrote the script to his well received film bon voyage 2003 unlike director <UNK> <UNK> safe conduct aka <UNK> 2002 w d <UNK> gloomy sunday 1999 or w d claude <UNK> 1997 bon voyage is as <UNK> as its title sounds <UNK> la <UNK> whatever and we have the beautiful talented isabelle <UNK> to thank for it is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction and attention the cause and effect of it all that made the film so enjoyable as it is hell what's another of her plan and expectations will worry about that another time the <UNK> of the story does <UNK> around a pair of young <UNK> as and <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> 8 women as <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> depardieu the witty <UNK> <UNK> of my wife is an actress and versatile peter <UNK> <UNK> french english and german here are some of the stellar cast involved br br there are many characters coming and going in this plot of a movie and how it's all is a <UNK> knack that requires no analysis is simply a genius the story just builds upon itself one episode after another or even with <UNK> events but never confusing that's the delight of it all somehow every detail turns out right on the screen and we just lap it all up like a presented french <UNK> literally so there's thrills tender <UNK> moments and taut ominous escapes all playing out in front of our eyes br br from reading the director's note on the <UNK> pictures bon voyage official site <UNK> this is his most personal and successful work ever depicting <UNK> 1940 from memories of his childhood years is very much close to his heart and he had worked and <UNK> the script for almost 3 years this film is a labor of love all round the cast and crew <UNK> the director's passion and a <UNK> script by <UNK> writers along with the director and his son <UNK> adaptation efforts by <UNK> <UNK> patrick and <UNK> br br music by gabriel varied in tone from his previous film scores like the english patient or talented mr <UNK> who provided a <UNK> theme that kept the pace and rhythm of the plot going almost like a train going non stop <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> energy even when she's tired keeping her going as she meets whatever comes walking on with head held high and stylish <UNK> always no looking back let alone time for regrets br br ah <UNK> forget the wonderfully translated <UNK> subtitles by ian who also did subtitles for films in italian bread and <UNK> 2000 aka <UNK> e the last kiss 2001 aka <UNK> <UNK> and tom <UNK> heaven 2002 br br if you find this much too light a wartime relationship drama try w d <UNK> and <UNK> 1999 in german based on a true story with brilliant performances from <UNK> as <UNK> and maria <UNK> as <UNK>
<START> my take the <UNK> of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies br br as if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and <UNK> elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet <UNK> airport <UNK> is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has <UNK> its welcome br br the film opens with a rather catchy score by <UNK> <UNK> backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000 but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is <UNK> than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe <UNK> now the pilot of the <UNK> co <UNK> by co pilot <UNK> <UNK> en route to france after the summer <UNK> on board is reporter maggie <UNK> susan <UNK> who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons <UNK> kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance <UNK> and best <UNK> to prevent the <UNK> from landing br br the cast subplots are dumber than ever even <UNK> than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a live human heart in a <UNK> martha <UNK> as a woman with a <UNK> condition and the character doesn't go deeper than that j j walker a a pot smoking <UNK> arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> much to the sour watching eye of coach <UNK> plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the <UNK> cameos of <UNK> and her pet <UNK> and <UNK> anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disaster br br rating 1 2 out of 5
<START> this movie definitely made me laugh but that doesn't mean it was exactly funny well then again me and my friends had a lot of fun watching it br br i doubt there is anything about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice before just like the plot itself all of the characters are <UNK> movie clich√© cardboard box roles that don't even require acting skills <UNK> such skills are not delivered we have the corrupt cop a ruthless killer who claims to care about his men and their families whilst caring nothing about people he shoots in the <UNK> at so close a range as to have blood <UNK> on his face we have the worn out cop on the edge so nicely pointed at in the discussion boards of this movie we have the old one day away from retirement cop who just about everyone must have immediately identified as the most likely man on the inside since he had most to gain and he didn't utter a <UNK> word throughout the movie about as see through as a glass house on a sunny day the big black gangster king was a copy of all previous big black gangster kings in movie history they could've just called him wallace but just slightly <UNK> and more ruthless because something has to emphasize that we also know laurence fishburne from actually good movies then we finally have the highly educated doctor who can't think of anything reasonable to do as soon as the situation <UNK> from her ordinary life and who spends the majority of the movie sitting in a corner <UNK> trying to figure out how to hold on to the weapon she was given not using it br br the whole siege story is not interesting not original having been used twice before and this movie manages to add absolutely nothing interesting to it there is the initial <UNK> then the laying of the siege then the assault then the escape attempts meanwhile a bunch of strained <UNK> freaked out cops and thugs manage to hold off a police assault team with high tech equipment and the quite important advantage of vision then again in deep night with the power cut and with a snow storm raging <UNK> there is definitely a lot of light coming in so who really cares about night vision br br but the best part comes right at the end in the first scenes showing <UNK> 13 we see it is <UNK> in an of an industrial city <UNK> and office buildings surround it on all sides from this point the <UNK> walk maybe a hundred <UNK> in a <UNK> and where do they end up some alley ending right in the middle of a forest a forest where did that forest come from who decided to lay a <UNK> forest in the middle of an industrial area how is this forest in the last scene suddenly on a hill over the city in question while in the scenes inside the forest it looked <UNK> flat br br from here i leave the judgment to you and to your common sense go and see this movie if you're looking for an <UNK> good laugh i can really recommend it
<START> <UNK> a <UNK> is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful it's really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences it's a masterpiece i also recommend the novel <UNK> visconti is a genius
<START> when they announced this movie for <UNK> i was excited a travesty from donald <UNK> enough was one of my all time favorite stories after i watched it i was not all that thrilled recently i had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt and once again i was disappointed she didn't like it much either and she'd never read the book in this movie they managed to <UNK> all the charm from the book and turn it into dull <UNK> a big part of the problem was william h macy i like him fine in other films but he played terry carey as a <UNK> incompetent in the book takes a lot of <UNK> for his nerves but remains <UNK> <UNK> at almost all times which is part of the fun spoilers follow they also left out a big part of the story other than a 2 second glimpse at the <UNK> where <UNK> not 1 but 4 <UNK> for the police this is important not just because it's funny but because it helps set up the relationship between fred and in the movie <UNK> betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting because they don't seem all that close in the book they become pretty good friends especially on <UNK> side which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that <UNK> downfall fred also suffered a bit from casting i love adam arkin but he was not a cheerful happy to be alive upbeat sort of detective character traits which book fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking patricia and were pretty close to the book and james <UNK> was great despite not looking much like martin <UNK> the whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding body after ships it to seattle and <UNK> the death on the mob <UNK> was okay although she was mostly <UNK> and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying i don't mind changes to books to make movies i know they are necessary because of length and difficulty but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of <UNK>
<START> i'm not usually into dark psychological thriller type things however <UNK> me is really an amazing piece of work the story acting filming psychological themes erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really quite complex and compelling rose plays the <UNK> and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman really quite accurately my partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange issues were handled it was so intense for us to watch that we found ourselves leaving it three quarters through to get tea and i felt compelled to have a shower the story was gripping but we were clearly unable to handle all the energy in one straight shot it <UNK> into the gritty and <UNK> side of people but doesn't leave you there i thought about the characters and deeper meanings for a long time i would highly recommend this one still be prepared for an experience you might not be expecting
<START> jewel thief is a rare breed of film completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation a young man <UNK> superbly played by a newly face lifted <UNK> <UNK> at age 40 is estranged from his police officer dad and finds a job in a store soon random people come up to him and call him <UNK> using just a few <UNK> moments the presence of a <UNK> is established then a woman comes forward and claims to be engaged to said <UNK> she is accompanied by her loving brother <UNK> kumar who is so convinced that <UNK> is actually <UNK> he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not the 6 <UNK> one the super cute daughter <UNK> is completely <UNK> with <UNK> amidst all this confusion there is a jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will slowly we learn from encounter with a super hot night club singer helen that the thief is <UNK> the <UNK> many many good looking women are after the hero the police force including dad are completely <UNK> <UNK> is slowly falling for and her brother seems to bless the union the action moves to as that is where next heist is to occur the rest is for you to watch the <UNK> the girls the men who hang on to every word thinking he is their boss <UNK> the loving brother sister duo nothing seems quite right and it takes the <UNK> story telling and direction by <UNK> <UNK> to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner the movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously <UNK> into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in br br i was not a big fan but she is quite competent here although at her she is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way but is best when she is <UNK> or dancing <UNK> is cute as a button and i loved her in this film i so badly wanted her to get the man <UNK> was well <UNK> if he were not walking like a man with a <UNK> shoulder <UNK> one shoulder always lower than the other i would wonder who they had found to imitate him yet his style charm and charisma were <UNK> in the song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> only <UNK> could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached <UNK> kumar was simply awesome <UNK> did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> magic with numbers like <UNK> <UNK> helen in a blood red <UNK> imitation dancing on a bar top <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and my personal favorite seductive number <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br if you are <UNK> a great story with more twists than a <UNK> wanting to be kept guessing yet amused and entertained then go buy or rent jewel thief better to buy it then you can go back and see it again with your buddies this one is a keeper
<START> you have to like baseball and you have to at least sort of like tom <UNK> but if you meet those <UNK> you should thoroughly enjoy this movie <UNK> plays former major league star who finds himself <UNK> to japan as his career winds down really well thought out and fascinating look at japanese customs and behavior great supporting performances by manager <UNK> clint eastwood his girl friend and his <UNK> the chemistry between <UNK> and works very very well this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball look for <UNK> as fellow player well before he became a <UNK> <UNK> for movie <UNK> up very nicely easily in my top fifty all time movies and maybe my favorite one on baseball
<START> i've been a fan of jim <UNK> and his characters since the very beginning the most <UNK> thing about them was the love and innocence and <UNK> shown <UNK> was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving a spiritual character yet <UNK> and <UNK> so all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co exist in a caring manner together <UNK> each other's difference br br following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe yet this it's a very merry muppet christmas movie would have jim <UNK> spinning in his grave these characters have been completely re written to be horny nasty selfish and cheesy br br the cast goes on to portray god as an <UNK> corporate head with a mean streak angels as <UNK> non spiritual corporate staff and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching i had bought it for my great nephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a child br br this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm br br shame shame on the people who re wrote the characters and <UNK> from jim <UNK> original heart centered socially conscious version it does a terrible <UNK> to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations
<START> i having both read and watched gone with the wind found it very difficult to not compare this movie with the original although i thought scarlett the novel was superb the movie didn't add up it was a completely different story of course there will never be another scarlett and <UNK> besides leigh and gable but the new actors did a fine job considering i loved the way the book and movie wrapped up the story of with the wind because after reading it i felt a <UNK> of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened scarlett finishes the story very well and alexandra <UNK> did great on the book i just wish the movie followed the story more although it is great in itself
<START> this documentary was my first introduction to peak oil theory a fascinating concept that has a lot of frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct i had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil <UNK> would come so soon it literally took my breath away this movie will probably open your eyes as to how strongly the american way of life is <UNK> on the abundance of cheap oil a term used throughout the film a lot of the topics are plain common sense and they don't go into a huge amount of depth about any of them but you've probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does the interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting i don't think this film is meant to scare people it's merely meant to inform people about what to expect in the years ahead and maybe to encourage you to think twice about to work and leaving your lights on all day long br br after watching this film i was no longer able to look at the cars and <UNK> <UNK> by quite the same great documentary everyone should see it
<START> they give you the set up then bore you to death with a constant cat and mouse chase the main characters are involved in one constant stand off where they <UNK> each other every five minutes or less and i'd like to see the police force that would let one of their cops pull off the a garcia bit it's like some local cop walking charlie <UNK> out of prison to go get a cup of coffee get real
<START> as someone who loves baseball history especially the early 20th century in which <UNK> was a main figure along with a ton of colorful characters i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film well it wasn't a baseball film which was disappointing no it was just a account of being with <UNK> in the later years while the two <UNK> on a book even at that this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it br br granted <UNK> was anything but a nice guy an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you and he was <UNK> <UNK> and had a lot of demons to fight he was so hated his own <UNK> tried to <UNK> his chances of winning a <UNK> title one year nonetheless this an over the top portrayal of the man it makes him into something almost cartoon like br br watching and listening to an old man rant rave and <UNK> for two hours is entertainment no it isn't some day i'd love to see a real biopic of <UNK> showing him in his days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy so be it but the way they did it here with just a bitter <UNK> old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch
<START> i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were <UNK> i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don't say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a <UNK> comment this film is amazing love me <UNK> p s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops this film will go down in children's film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children
<START> i've seen this movie more than once and it's worth it for those of you who like martial arts and <UNK> internal conflict this is a worthy choice after seeing this movie i wanted to be a more <UNK> member of society because i could relate to the inner turmoil of a girl looking for acceptance and needing a path to follow of course mr <UNK> always provides his <UNK> advice 2 thumbs up
<START> lance <UNK> got paid something to appear in this i hope it was a lot br br former us national champion <UNK> <UNK> phillips starts as charlie case a <UNK> turn secret agent because it's very common that <UNK> <UNK> become government spies br br there's a truly hysterical opening scene where charlie's uneven bars routine is <UNK> by an eastern <UNK> <UNK> what follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes i've ever witnessed and they want you to take it seriously don't worry she sticks her <UNK> br br everything after that is just a messy dreck of a spy movie watch the first fifteen minutes for the campy <UNK> stuff then run for cover
<START> a high school track star falls dead after winning a race shortly after her older sister <UNK> <UNK> returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing who could the killer be you may not care enough to want to find out br br crude cheap amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless although top billed christopher george as the nasty hard driving track coach tries to give it a lift with an intense performance not even the gore is worth mentioning the whole thing is lame from beginning to end starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music and the casting of e j once a co star of the movie hello <UNK> as a character named <UNK> that's right <UNK> this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously but in any case it's a <UNK> br br it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the friday the 13th movies look like works of art in comparison br br the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by white of all people br br 2 10
<START> a not so good action thriller because it <UNK> <UNK> the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law in my opinion the performance of <UNK> wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film bob is okay as the main heavy the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia one of the film reasons to see the <UNK> man 1996 is for the brief <UNK> of the beautiful and <UNK> cox its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them
<START> i just found out before writing this review that <UNK> vs <UNK> and another movie called curse of the <UNK> were both directed by the same guy jim <UNK> that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises they both feature a military <UNK> island a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to a <UNK> that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island and giant <UNK> dragons created through genetic experiments running amok what differences are there well the <UNK> on the island are now <UNK> wanting to expose the government secret and there's a giant <UNK> on the island as well hence the title <UNK> vs <UNK> even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the <UNK> ' <UNK> vs <UNK> is more or less what you'd expect given its title and its channel origin the sci fi channel although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you i liked a movie called <UNK> i hardly doubt this one will br br <UNK> vs <UNK> is not only a boring film but it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci fi flicks i've seen in a long time in some of these movies there is an air to them that <UNK> the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort but i see very little here that's <UNK> again by it just being a rehash of curse of the <UNK> the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second rate video game the cinematography and <UNK> en scene is poor the acting <UNK> from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put <UNK> bad i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without <UNK> and i can deal with this but in this movie where michael <UNK> takes a single thirty eight <UNK> and fires it approximately fifty times <UNK> without <UNK> at first i laughed but even then it just became <UNK> that would be the <UNK> ' a monster appears people scream <UNK> fires <UNK> without <UNK> his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eaten br br <UNK> vs <UNK> is a very bad movie the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in a <UNK> manner is an actress named michelle who is not only very beautiful but a surprisingly strong performer even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given michelle managed to pull off a surprisingly good performance and it just me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a film as <UNK> as this she obviously took it for the paycheck but it won't boost her career any i'm afraid

<START> dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus <UNK> this movie strikes me as foolish <UNK> that has <UNK> into an <UNK> camp classic the best kind memorable lines include knowledge is like a deer chase it and it will run away from you and drink this it will make you feel better it is so <UNK> bad they couldn't have made it any worse if they tried br br segal tries to convince you that he is 1 sensitive by saving a stricken <UNK> 2 a good father by a <UNK> cooking scene for his daughter 3 a man of science by looking at a fake spectrum 4 in tune with nature by using <UNK> 5 politically correct and <UNK> by having indian friends 6 an <UNK> by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab and 7 an action hero by being really fat but yet can still fight br br it's good to see on as a late night saturday flick with friends preferably but not necessarily <UNK>
<START> wow that james <UNK> looks exactly like thomas jane br br that's the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather <UNK> george and the dragon for a fantasy comedy the story was very dull and the effects <UNK> br br the problem wasn't the acting james <UNK> makes a good knight and his various side kicks are not bad characters i even thought patrick <UNK> in this role was a pretty good idea too flat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also had some nice potential i even liked the kid br br but the story and everything that happens and the way it happens was just eh not interesting compared to another recent fantasy comedy ella enchanted which was actually funny this movie comes up terribly short i'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn inducing br br 4 out of 10
<START> how could anyone who liked the previous <UNK> movies even stand to sit through this 1 hour of drivel there are so many stupid things about this film it's mind <UNK> i remember when i went to see <UNK> as a kid it was my favorite movie and franchise the acting the <UNK> the music the direction all fantastic in my opinion was ok pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments like the <UNK> girl kicking a <UNK> please but on a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience br br but the the third one has no point it's supposed to be a sequel that <UNK> on from and yet it magically includes brand new things to the franchise that would have been impossible to miss on the previous 2 films for example 1 the new mega seriously what the hell this thing follows them everywhere they go they cannot escape it's presence and yet in the lost world the same island do you see it once do you hear it does anyone even mention it no its ridiculous the star character in the previous 2 movies was and always will be the t rex so what does the d joe <UNK> go and do kill it off as soon as you see the huge t rex in all its awesome roaring glory it gets killed and you never see it again a new <UNK> on the town is the excuse where did it come from not a single explanation and don't get me started on the whole satellite phone in the <UNK> belly thing 2 just when you start to get over how stupid the is you see the <UNK> aside from their new punk <UNK> they seem pretty credible <UNK> they will make this movie watchable right wrong now they speak to each other and the excuse for them speaking in this film and not in the first and second are wait for it evolution yes the process of millions of years in just a few months from when the second movie ended amazing <UNK> they should have grown thumbs and created tools by now ok i am not going to say anymore about the plot because it's getting up my nose so i will close on this jurassic park is a classic is a lousy sucker punch to any of the original fans of the series my favorite franchise was well and truly dead after watching this monstrosity no pun intended avoid this movie like the plague
<START> is extremely boring this is the basis of the show mel or ask extremely easy questions that a 2 year old could answer at an extremely slow pace this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period people may like this show because the <UNK> are eye candy but they're <UNK> completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so <UNK> annoying br br during the show they mention that we need more players a million times the top 5 <UNK> that they do probably takes about 20 minutes out of the show this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made one of the reasons they probably don't have <UNK> is because the show is so cheap with the money the most money i've ever seen them hand out was <UNK> i wouldn't be surprised if this game show is canceled by the end of 2006
<START> it's really a shame there was so much controversy surrounding this picture in other words the infamous affair between ingrid bergman and <UNK> <UNK> as this drew a lot of attention to a very forgettable film the story is incredibly slow cheap looking and uninteresting and to top this off the film is stuffed to the <UNK> with amateurish actors who can barely speak any english i really would have preferred subtitles it would have made the experience less <UNK> back to the rotten acting the neo <UNK> movement was big in italy at the time this film was made many of these films are absolute masterpieces such as de <UNK> <UNK> d the children are watching us and miracle in <UNK> because they got so much out of the non professional actors they <UNK> like normal people but in <UNK> they act like normal people trying to be actors and come off very badly like kids in a school play br br by the way if you are hoping the movie has a good ending thereby making your time commitment to the film worth while don't bother the plot was just totally <UNK> and silly so much so that i really found that i could have cared less about the characters like the island they all inhabit the film is desolate and without color or life
<START> the green <UNK> <UNK> thomas <UNK> <UNK> 2003 br br how do the danes keep coming up with these films that are consistently funny <UNK> written <UNK> filmed and filled with great performances the green <UNK> is a dark and <UNK> funny comedy in many ways the danish counterpart of eating <UNK> and <UNK> but it has more on offer than just laughs or parody br br the film brings us the duo of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lie and <UNK> <UNK> sick of their evil boss the two pals decide to open their own butcher shop in a small danish town but initially business is slow and customers stay away when an <UNK> is accidentally locked up and <UNK> in their meat locker decides to turn the man's <UNK> into he promptly <UNK> this special dish suddenly has everyone in town <UNK> to their counter and unable to resist this sudden leap into popularity turns into a serial killer with acting as his reluctant <UNK> but soon led by their ex boss many people in town are starting to wonder what special ingredients the two men are using br br without the extraordinary performances by and the film might not have <UNK> above the level of the average black comedy on paper the character of might border on caricature but <UNK> portrait is that of an earnest insecure and deeply twisted man but manages to make him frightening funny and moving at the same time actually plays a double role also playing his <UNK> twin brother when watching the film i never even realized it was the same actor the other performances are just as wonderful with every character in town <UNK> off the hook with some truly wonderful vignettes br br the subject material is naturally a bit morbid and the material might not be completely fresh considering quite a few predecessors that handled the same kind of material but director <UNK> gives it a fresh twist and manages to build some real characters with the strange duo of and with this wonderfully bizarre tale of two social <UNK> br br camera <UNK> 9 10
<START> this is the worst work ever of daniel day lewis i can not believe that in the same year he made this awful movie and my left foot please stay away from this movie this is a movie only for <UNK> people as a curiosity the plot is impossible to understand the writer thinks that in <UNK> all the people speaks in english of course the bring a very good frame for the photo shooting of the film but that is not enough reason to see this movie i repeat only if you are very fan of daniel day lewis or if you want to see the south of <UNK> part of the and you do not have enough money to travel yourself
<START> if you'd like a great april <UNK> joke then please by all means show this film to someone however it is important that you in no way criticize the film but instead talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how they just don't make great films like this any more as your victim watches many <UNK> and nonsensical scenes such as a cute dog getting <UNK> for no apparent reason a cow standing on the bed a woman <UNK> a <UNK> feet or jesus apparently <UNK> a woman make lots of comments using words like brilliance <UNK> or <UNK> all the while acting as if the film actually makes perfect sense and isn't a complete waste of an hour of your life also be sure to keep a straight face and <UNK> shock when and if they say that they either didn't understand it or thought it had all the artistry of a cow patty then to further mess with them show them all the comments on imdb as nearly all except for a few trouble makers like and talk about what genius and artistry this film is by the time you are done with this little <UNK> they'll most likely think they are idiots and will make an <UNK> with a psychologist br br this to me is the only possible reason to watch this horrid mess of a film that or you could show it to the prisoners at <UNK> in order to get them to talk br br if you ask me the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a <UNK> elvis painting are superior artistically
<START> okay make no mistake this is a pretty awful film but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and <UNK> its pathetic budget every now and then at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and <UNK> a face burning scene the part with the <UNK> bride br br this baby falls into the so bad it's entertaining category to me and for that alone i would give it a star the effects are terrible the acting is abysmal and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning too it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago while the <UNK> dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something i actually liked that in this case
<START> his music especially what we hear of it here is very slow from around the time of <UNK> death <UNK> had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace over a century later wagner and then wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get of course one can cheat by writing a 4 4 march and then a <UNK> of say 1 but that <UNK> wouldn't be the correct <UNK> wagner and wrote music that is properly played at a <UNK> pace given that the <UNK> in no sense sounds too slow <UNK> pace is the wrong expression a critic wrote of a famous wagner conductor he doesn't beat time he beats eternity for all i know this was meant as a compliment br br i get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the <UNK> possible films there's death in <UNK> and there's <UNK> i much prefer the former for one thing <UNK> steps over the line or some line and becomes <UNK> death in <UNK> is gripping from beginning to end not much happens but it all happens in the right sequence at the right pace with photography you can get lost in br br another way of cheating with music by the way is to write something that doesn't really have a <UNK> at all such music sounds slow but is really just just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form death in <UNK> isn't one of them beautiful in every respect it will remind you of the <UNK> and of quality you need no <UNK> knowledge to respond to <UNK> <UNK> as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence it's a great work
<START> i admit it now this is one of the <UNK> films ever made but in mr defense the not really scene wasn't all bad br br and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry dennis hopper br br what makes this scene so perfect is that father answers the blonde swedish speaking jewish girl in german br br the best actor actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of mother this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting but still puts in the most convincing performance of all br br all and all this flick is nostalgia for me personally it is after all what gave me a <UNK> on imdb s <UNK> d br br like a movie star
<START> i watched this movie tonight and i do need to say that it is horrible i expected it to be great because you know usually we don't have many movies about asian vampires mixed with asian culture but already in the beginning it started in a bad way the introduction of the movie seemed not to have an end the plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack off you really don't have anything useful at all the director of this film doesn't look to have some important notions about how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example not to mention some other things br br for people like me who wants to watch a great vampire movie i really recommend to watch or <UNK> interview with the
<START> out of the <UNK> or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere can not believe this hasn't received any reviews <UNK> is excellent in this van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off but that's the charm of the italian style beautiful photography and some excellently staged action all the supporting characters are well played the <UNK> of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to character in some of the situations that take place absolutely fantastic score by luis see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan a spaghetti must have
<START> this movie was unbelievably bad it's gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination and the plot what plot there really isn't any the pacing is unbelievably slow despite the random acts of violence and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills <UNK> for fun so this movie was banned in <UNK> countries i could see why not because of the gore boring and trite but because it was a terrible movie it should have been banned from existence avoid this one like the plague 1 out of 10
<START> a great movie with a rather unclear political message it¬¥s shot in a theatrical style i c most of the action takes place inside mayor and diana <UNK> seem equally suspicious of each other emotions run high since the western tourists and business people seem unwilling and unable to <UNK> to the eastern russian charm of the mayor although he makes every effort to understand their point of view the two opposite world views are made <UNK> clear but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics its <UNK> acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie
<START> this little picture succeeds where many a big picture fails because it was a little picture john ford was not <UNK> by the studio big <UNK> he was happier with this film than any other because he was able to do it his way he was also able to use his <UNK> of gifted character actors that had played such an important role in his past <UNK> some of them such as ben johnson had been discovered by ford and given opportunity to show their talents johnson was <UNK> by ford because he was an authentic cowboy from <UNK> who usually did his own stunt work years later he would win the <UNK> academy award for his brilliant performance in the last picture show ward bond even <UNK> ben johnson in this movie he is not the <UNK> master that role is played by johnson but because of this movie he was later given the role of <UNK> master in the classic television series <UNK> train ironically one of the bad guys in <UNK> master james <UNK> would star in the hit television series <UNK> on a rival network to <UNK> train ward bond plays the leader of the <UNK> heading west who often to his days by <UNK> only to be called down by fellow mormon adam <UNK> russell simpson when any <UNK> situation <UNK> elder ward bond yells blow your horn sister the mormon sister played to perfection by jane <UNK> then blows so hard and loud that even the devil must have been <UNK> by the sound <UNK> and simpson were famous for playing ma and <UNK> in ford's classic version of the john novel the <UNK> of wrath br br another of the great character actors in ford's company was hank <UNK> who plays one of uncle <UNK> <UNK> mean but not too bright outlaw sons <UNK> would become famous a few years later for playing in ford's the <UNK> <UNK> lived to be <UNK> he was still making movies when he died br br the <UNK> master travis blue ben johnson and his partner sandy harry carey jr are horse <UNK> who never take their job seriously having a lot of fun along the way especially with the local sheriff they get mixed up with a mormon <UNK> train heading west ford's beloved <UNK> valley is the setting for most of the film the main reason for the <UNK> is a <UNK> mormon beauty <UNK> <UNK> kathleen who catches <UNK> eye along the way the train picks up a <UNK> show which includes a <UNK> doctor alan <UNK> and two <UNK> angels <UNK> <UNK> and ruth <UNK> also joining up along the way is the <UNK> family wanted for murder and armed robbery ford shows how <UNK> a journey west by <UNK> was in those days br br the songs in the film were written by stan jones of the legendary sons of the <UNK> jones' writing was almost as good as that of bob nolan who had previously done much of the writing for the group jones' most famous song not in this film is the much recorded ghost riders in the sky the sons of the <UNK> do the background singing in <UNK> master this adds to the overall impact of <UNK> rolling west br br it should also be noted that the acclaimed native american <UNK> jim from <UNK> plays the role of a <UNK> leader this was his last film appearance he died not long after <UNK> master was released
<START> i cannot believe i sat through this utter waste of time i was just too fascinated by how <UNK> bad it was that i couldn't move it reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting <UNK> of a cow you can't help but look but you feel sick and <UNK> afterward br br let me elaborate plan 9 from outer space for instance is not a bad movie not even star wars holiday special is a bad movie they both are awful to watch for sure but they both have some qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the off button br br this remake in name only of the sci fi classic left me <UNK> on my couch desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed why anyone would <UNK> the memory of the original classic and whether or not i could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death br br although death i realized would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity
<START> may i never have to go to this hospital or <UNK> if i want to be politically correct which ass <UNK> this <UNK> phrase anyway for anything other than directions on how to get out of town george c did a masterful job playing the burned out over worked <UNK> who has come to the conclusion that his life has been a waste but is helpless to change his environment or conditions even when given a golden opportunity which probably wasn't so golden anyway i got several laughs out of this brutally black comedy however at the same time was and often <UNK> to the <UNK> because i fear this very atmosphere <UNK> most houses of healing even as i write
<START> i had very high hopes walking into this movie after all <UNK> 11 was a truly great hollywood product its rapid fire jokes incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films i have ever seen of course with all the money it made a sequel was on the way and i for one was excited br br needless to say i was absolutely blown away by this movie blown away by how horribly wrong things can go this movie had everything going for it the return of the entire original cast the same director news stories of crazy on and off set antics how could it possibly have gone so wrong br br it starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there after reasonably goofy short scenes between pitt zeta jones and clooney roberts the film spends several minutes watching andy garcia <UNK> from scene to scene telling each individual member of danny <UNK> original eleven that he wants his money back believe me when i say that these scenes are only here to pad andy <UNK> running time because without these ridiculously awkward shots his screen time would be well under five minutes br br this leads me to another major <UNK> i had with this film the pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story and only sometimes brought back later <UNK> <UNK> character is dropped from the script early on and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue garcia appears for the first few minutes and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20 25 minutes left even clooney himself spends a large <UNK> of the film in prison br br this would all be <UNK> if the film was funny at all 90 of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best the plot is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheated at one point in the film the team takes on a job worth 2 5 million of the nearly 100 million they need to raise before <UNK> two week <UNK> several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is but they do it anyway over 30 minutes of the film <UNK> around this job that they shouldn't even be doing and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time furthermore the equipment they use to pull this job off clearly cost millions upon millions to <UNK> just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than 2 5 million to pull off obviously because of this they have to pull off several jobs to make the money the beauty of the first film was the one big con and how <UNK> and <UNK> it was pulled off here they pull so many jobs in so many different ways that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long br br we all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end thus is the nature of the caper film the twist at the end of <UNK> twelve made me laugh not because it was funny but because i couldn't believe how cheated i felt i won't give it away because i know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway br br what i will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant br br i was excited to see this film after absolutely <UNK> <UNK> 11 i left the theater feeling like i had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in <UNK> me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching i have never given a 1 to a movie on imdb com but there's a first time for everything consider yourselves warned 1 10
<START> oh my god where to begin terror is one of the worst b horror movies ever made this crap makes demon <UNK> look like the exorcist special note a horror b movie needs to have at least one sex scene don't expect even a hot girl in this one with that <UNK> mistake i should begin with the complete bash br br first of all if you're going to make a horror monster movie you should spend big part of the budget in creating a cool monster outfit the monster in this movie looks like a 10 halloween costume there is no way the yes this is how it is spelled looks menacing in the movie it's an actor in a halloween outfit please it looks so cheap it makes me mad br br second the gore effects are the spinal <UNK> of any direct to video monster horror movie again the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects the blood looks damn fake please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two that's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds the ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied br br the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies but in this movie it's beyond terrible a cast of <UNK> with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince <UNK> members that he is sick the <UNK> he <UNK> is beyond laughable he's probably the worst actor ever in a b horror movie no kidding also captain <UNK> delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick br br the true story behind the is not even told all you get to know is that the monster sucks <UNK> blood why bother with this piece of crap do not even watch it even if you have the chance not even if it <UNK> on cable br br i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something different than hollywood but that doesn't means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage
<START> i put this film in the <UNK> on a <UNK> after a recent trip to nyc and i couldn't believe i'd never heard of it anywhere it has all the <UNK> of a cult classic starting with the characters they are <UNK> roles we recognize from every stretch of daily life but were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors playing them peter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> performances were particularly strong their interactions are poignant and grounded while at the same time <UNK> with a subtle quirky humor that is sadly all too rare in american films these days writer director <UNK> does a beautiful job of <UNK> these scenes together into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past highly recommended
<START> perhaps we are too much attached to great <UNK> when we hear of <UNK> brought to screen perhaps we expect too much from these films however if we as viewers are offered far too little what happens then br br that is what i thought after seeing by paul marcus a part of the production series on the roman empire <UNK> by roger young the first movie included at least peter o'toole but what does this movie include br br hardly anything accurate the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and <UNK> rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history throughout the movie we see <UNK> young young man during the allegedly long reign of <UNK> young man during the reign of <UNK> and finally during his own historically 14 year long reign and he dies the same according to the movie <UNK> born during the reign of lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late <UNK> when he dies continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie which makes it hardly logical not to say reliable <UNK> loses his father is raised by slaves at that time his mother is <UNK> by <UNK> later however she suddenly marries emperor <UNK> who already has big children with <UNK> married to him at these moments of the movie we see <UNK> <UNK> mistress all right it is historically accurate yet no source proves that she played such a <UNK> role in the rise of christianity in rome in the film she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul's miracle he brings a young girl <UNK> back to life besides there was historically nothing like <UNK> seen on the court of <UNK> since <UNK> was born in <UNK> 4 year long reign a d <UNK> <UNK> i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely <UNK> and many many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to but after 30 minutes of watching this film i <UNK> whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy br br as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment they are equally lame as the history here is the performances are artificial the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities perhaps i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles <UNK> in the lead but hans <UNK> does not fit as <UNK> at all he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor is he an artist who burns rome for a song is he a <UNK> who <UNK> the love to his relatives is he a cruel <UNK> who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of alleged justice none of these he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and in the long run begins to release the fire burning within himself john is out of place in this film as <UNK> and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character <UNK> is only sexy as yet she could have been much much better the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not <UNK> low budget results in low effects and consequently low entertainment br br but what made me most angry in this movie and as a result i give it 1 10 are some moments that are absolutely <UNK> br br the death of and st paul's talk with <UNK> at her dead body br br <UNK> mention of the current conquest of <UNK> on the feast and soon his death he <UNK> <UNK> while was his wife much before his death br br killing laura <UNK> <UNK> mother br br <UNK> arguments in the speech to the <UNK> br br finally <UNK> death a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by let us forgive him br br all in all this film is a waste of time and is absolutely <UNK> as yet another production concerning the roman empire it's better to make one good film in 30 years than ten minor little ones in 5 years 1 10 should not have been made at all
<START> had clearly not seen the film in decades and his memory is appalling his attempts to paint the mark lester <UNK> scene as suspect are utterly <UNK> as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy <UNK> <UNK> at the kid's body lester is <UNK> for the entire time the man is in the room and the man barely gives him a glance br br the scene is a crude attempt to show <UNK> innocent curiosity about the man's body br br like everything in this film it's badly done but nothing more br br even comments about character who casually sent a german family to their deaths by <UNK> their trailer off a cliff is nonsense it was a single woman she was already dead and she was in a car br br i suggest that review says far far more about his own far from liberal mindset than it does about this <UNK> film br br the only reason i even bothered to look it up was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after <UNK> br br the film is a worthless piece of 70's trash but review of it is the worst kind of <UNK> he <UNK> up his review in pseudo intellectual facts but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every factual matter he <UNK> br br i can only assume that saw exactly what he looked for which is disturbing now he can return to burning copies of <UNK> in the <UNK>
<START> this was my second experience of the monkey island series the full seven years after i had been shown the first game what was my response oh great we're playing a cartoon i'm glad my brother shut me up then and played on because the jokes caught my attention once again as well as wonderful voice acting of not to mention everyone else done well i still think <UNK> sounds better than the <UNK> do well to illustrate something happening and the art of both the game and <UNK> are excellent when we found the cd with the originals secret and revenge we were both <UNK> and spent hours working through revenge one such moment was where we just sat down and blew half a day on it however has to be the monkey island game i've played the most especially for the return of and combat on the high <UNK> that moment when you encounter kenny and he tells you he's gone straight and then i'm running guns had both my brother and i in tears from laughter and that's not the best part of the game not by far
<START> i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many many many many scenes of lucas the young protagonist walking and looking at things yep and you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless meaningless and pretty much ignored for the rest of the film br br this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things and the <UNK> person of them all is young lucas who is going blind and needs an operation you see he has <UNK> terrible <UNK> he thinks a killer is <UNK> on blind women he walks around a lot and acts like an <UNK> jerk br br patience does not pay off with this film by the end the plot and events are just as confusing and <UNK> and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant nothing is made clear the film moves at a <UNK> pace and it left me with the same effects of a <UNK> br br judging from afraid of the dark the british don't make stupid thrillers like the americans do they make boring ones
<START> this is one of the best tv movies i have ever seen the title makes it so obvious and predictable but come on all tv movies are like that br br the story is fantastic it may seem ridiculous but it is based on an incredibly true story gary cole plays a military man named dave who feels trapped in his marriage he <UNK> his wife and kids and then <UNK> his death all so he could be with <UNK> karen how far will dave go to keep his secret br br the acting is top notch for tv movies gary cole especially keeps the movie together as a charming smooth talking <UNK> who has an answer to everything when his wife gets suspicious karen does the best she can as a wife who discovers that her husband is a liar and doesn't know what to do about it <UNK> who i believe is gary <UNK> wife in real life plays her part well especially when she cries about the death of her husband wendy adds a nice touch as <UNK> sister linda is great in her small role as <UNK> mother br br predictable but the acting and the story take this movie up several <UNK>
<START> having finally caught up with this masterpiece it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever in its day it's french arty under played to the point of agony and ultimately downbeat but viewed from the <UNK> of <UNK> years in the future it's also just a bit vacuous pretentious and unsatisfying br br others have <UNK> the story but i don't think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film the lead characters corey and <UNK> really don't deserve what they get they play square within their code never harm anyone who didn't ask for it and show great courage and <UNK> moreover corey in particular is <UNK> by his former <UNK> ' who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed apparently just because he corey <UNK> to <UNK> a few thousand <UNK> these are guys who really ought to be due for a break instead things go far worse for them than they really need to within the logic of the story br br one might <UNK> that this is the whole point that the real villains never get caught that they <UNK> with the police as needed sell out their friends and always come out on top but that's not shown either <UNK> old gangster friend is not shown with the police nor is he shown <UNK> over his victory in fact after <UNK> several times when he's needed he's nowhere to be seen at the conclusion leaving a dramatic tension his <UNK> with corey entirely <UNK> br br nonetheless i'd say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography its slow deliberate pacing its great deadpan performances its elaborate heist sequence and its <UNK> of the art film style of the late 1960s
<START> bullets may not have <UNK> off his chest but the lone ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other <UNK> hero superman he represented truth justice and the american way in a classic tv western setting living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill while <UNK> the american <UNK> with his faithful indian companion <UNK> to bring every single outlaw to justice the <UNK> of tv provided the perfect opportunity for a post war generation to find it's ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order while providing <UNK> entertainment for five seasons <UNK> almost eight years br br today i had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to <UNK> the continuity of the story for fans of the ranger this is the grand daddy of all western <UNK> telling as it does how texas ranger john reid survived the <UNK> by the butch gang and how he was <UNK> back to health by an indian friend from his childhood <UNK> jay declares his companion a and names him <UNK> i've read various interpretations of the origin of the term <UNK> but i'm satisfied with explanation reading too much into it just <UNK> from the story just like the english translation of from spanish which i won't reveal because it's just better not to know if you can help it br br i thought it quite clever how the origin story created the <UNK> of the lone ranger like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the rangers died in the box canyon <UNK> you never see the face of the man who becomes the lone ranger as it's always turned away or <UNK> to hide his real identity even the origin of silver is handled brilliantly the voice of the story's narrator describing the wild sterling qualities would that relate say to sterling silver i got the biggest kick out of that br br of course with the passage of time watching the lone ranger episodes today offers a view of how <UNK> the show was beyond the origin story some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy particularly when it comes to a lone ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it's <UNK> hand and how about that little wave he gives to <UNK> whenever they're about to <UNK> the bad guys it's always the same gesture but <UNK> always knows what it means in different circumstances then you have the episodes where <UNK> moore takes off the ranger mask to don a different disguise to <UNK> another character in service to the story he even went under cover once as an actor portraying president abraham lincoln to <UNK> a villain top hat and all br br few fans that i come across ever know that actor john hart replaced <UNK> moore for the <UNK> <UNK> season in a contract <UNK> that moore had with the show's producers if you ever saw that happy days episode where <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> hero you'll notice it was john hart listed in the credits it's difficult actually to tell if you're watching a hart episode or not the key is to listen to the voice moore's is so distinctive that it's a dead <UNK> br br if you ever get the chance to <UNK> some of the final season color episodes you're in for a treat the <UNK> i've seen on vhs are absolutely gorgeous although i don't know if commercial <UNK> are available most of the black and white episodes around have been re <UNK> by any number of <UNK> in different so getting your hands on those should be no problem the must see of course is the three part origin and if you don't watch anything else this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the <UNK> most famous heroes hi <UNK> silver
<START> first of all you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles pornography kinky sex and utter horrifying and truly shocking <UNK> i mentioned kinky sex but to call sex in the second half of the movie kinky would be a great understatement it's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness that being said i can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo snuff genre brought to us by our fellow japanese br br the plot seems to be fairly basic almost nonexistent a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie don't expect much in first 30 40 minutes there is some dialog if you don't speak japanese it's not going to mean much to you that seems to be an occasional <UNK> between the girl and the crew performer then there is some porn straight sex and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break and then it starts to happen br br it seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene this time tied with the rope the abuse begins <UNK> <UNK> hot wax in the end girl breaks down and cries they <UNK> her br br then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened except for the girl she is <UNK> <UNK> and looks like she wants to leave she walks to the door sits on the floor to put her shoes on and that's when hell breaks loose br br she is hit in the head with the baseball bat her wound is treated she is tied to the bed what ensues can be briefly described i'm not going to spoil everything for you as rape during <UNK> think of flower of flesh and blood mix it with porn and you will get the idea it goes on for about 20 minutes or so <UNK> are very good makeup too everything is shown with no mercy for the viewer you have been warned br br i thought visitor q was a very sick movie after watching it looked like a fairytale to me this movie is so sick so <UNK> so twisted so disgusting that the <UNK> words pale in comparison to it's finale too bad it's released only on vhs so there are no subtitles available but the movie still works without them so if you are into ultra sickness extreme <UNK> and other <UNK> of this beloved genre check this out i hope you won't have nightmares 8 10
<START> a serial killer carl has been kidnapping and murdering young women by letting them <UNK> in a water filled cell he is <UNK> by the fbi but is in a coma and his latest kidnap victim <UNK> in a cell timed to fill with water br br take a look at the above premise and you'll see that there's a very much seen it all before look to it the magic of mark script is that he changes a <UNK> old <UNK> plot in to something quite different from what you're expecting if i mentioned the plot involves a machine that allows a psychiatrist to enter the mind of then sets up a different film entirely br br this <UNK> <UNK> be enough to make the cell a different class of thriller but director <UNK> creates a visually striking surreal thriller the cinematography by paul where <UNK> primary colours are to the <UNK> is stunning but <UNK> doesn't let it end there things like costume design where wanders around his <UNK> universe wearing <UNK> costumes does have a visual impact making this so much more than a run of a mill thriller br br what stops the cell becoming a classic movie however is that you start becoming more and more aware that the whole movie revolves around the visuals rather than having a natural narrative we see a third character a fbi man enter <UNK> but this seems more like a contrived plot turn just to introduce the audience to more stunning but very disturbing moments br br it should also be pointed out that this is a rather disturbing thriller with a atmosphere that is very depressing and that stops the film from being if not enjoyable then involving one scene where a fbi agent <UNK> a case where a <UNK> beats a rap only to later cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with so much despair you might reach for the off button you'll probably have to watch a massive amount of thrillers till you see another one as <UNK> as this one
<START> a great movie about triumph over all the <UNK> <UNK> who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible i won't go on about it other than to say that i liked to reflect on the this film when i'm facing something particularly <UNK> and realize that if <UNK> could do what he did i can certainly face the task before me definitely a feel good movie br br see it you won't be disappointed
<START> what's his name what clear br br that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released br br i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue br br madonna plays <UNK> <UNK> a young woman <UNK> for a crime she didn't commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge br br <UNK> dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his <UNK> father john the future father in law asks to take <UNK> from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications <UNK> some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way br br madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only 8 10 but on the other hand i can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice br br this film shows <UNK> comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while <UNK> morris is perfect as the <UNK> fianc√©e br br yes it's predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more
<START> i vaguely remember this film i do remember it for the one solid reason that it is the only film that i have ever walked out on and since then i have never seen it available to rent anywhere i can't spoil it for anyone <UNK> i can barely remember it to think looking at the cast it seemed a winner with john <UNK> directing but good god they must have been paid a whole lot for this drivel all i can seem to recall is that the dad goes missing and the family try to search for him by trying to put an actual photograph into the disc drive of a computer i walked out after about half an hour of this i must confess though i'd love to see if i can get a copy just to see if it really was that bad br br it wouldn't surprise me if this was on every actor's black list i mean christopher lee was in this the legend of all bad guys who'd been in star wars and lord of the rings as i said black listed movie the
<START> it¬¥s all my fault they all told me i should avoid seeing this movie because <UNK> a huge fan of the old tv series they were right while production values are good and the actors themselves including <UNK> look now julie christie that bad the whole film displays a and self <UNK> that clearly is without any justification a comparison between the karloff mummy and the mummy returns 2000 comes to my mind in fact 2000 owes much more to the new mummy films than to the old series but then scripting is terrible speed there is none and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes the first scene in the tomb looks plain stupid with cats clearly being thrown when <UNK> supposed to jump landing with their first moves around like a statue on <UNK> neither impressive nor scary and the psychological drama that <UNK> in the old tv series when the heroine had to learn that <UNK> a villain is completely neglected this movie is so wasted wasted money wasted actors wasted <UNK> that it hurts it¬¥s a below par mummy rip off <UNK> only good for some laughs but has nothing at all to do with the <UNK> classic she has a small role in this movie too on the graveyard
<START> i go this game and it is alright i guess i just expected a bit more the main problem with this is that the <UNK> is extremely hard even if you read the <UNK> you can't get it also the graphics aren't as good as <UNK> tomorrow and double agent this game could do with some <UNK> it says that if guards are <UNK> in water and you shoot a <UNK> shocker in the water the guard will <UNK> up but nothing happens in my opinion this is the worst out of the three i haven't played the first one but have played <UNK> tomorrow this and double agent this game deserves a 4 10 though could do with some <UNK>
<START> in all it took me three attempts to get through this movie although not total trash i've found a number of things to be more useful to <UNK> my time to such as taking off my <UNK> with <UNK> br br the actors involved have to feel about the same as people who star in <UNK> <UNK> commercials do people won't really pay to see either the <UNK> you earn won't be the best for you personally but at least the commercials get air time br br the first one was bad but this gave the word bad a whole new definition but it does have one good feature if your kids bug you about letting them watch r rated movies before you want them to tie them down and pop this little gem in watch the whining stop and the tears begin
<START> the boys were the most appealing things in the entire movie the girls were lame and pathetic i mean how can they own their own clothing line dolls movies producing studios and not smell this bomb from far away in order to gain some sort of responsibility which i dont really see the sense in the punishment they are sent to paris far far far away from home to live with the so called strict grandfather who holds an important standing with paris i cant really remember what he was so who really cares the detail <UNK> help the girls are sent to paris to learn something so what exactly do they learn when they meet two french boys and are able to manipulate the guy that supposed to watch them so they can meet these guys on <UNK> the typical pre teen movie having all pre teens wishing to and be able to afford the trip to paris or some far away country away from parents i dont really like the anyways they never could really shake off the image of michelle on full house in case you didnt see that then you were lucky from the start f f
<START> i saw this film many years ago along with another of films wings as part of a soviet film series at a local film archive but none of films as far as i can tell have ever made it to video or dvd in the united states <UNK> is a great film by any standard with stunning black and white photography hypnotic direction and actors so deep into their roles that you have no sense of them merely giving a performance although the period details of russian resistance to and collaboration with german <UNK> are very telling the story is timeless two russian <UNK> are captured by the germans and the <UNK> <UNK> their integrity as well as their courage i suspect the reason why it has not been released on dvd by the russians here comes the spoiler is that the jewish intellectual and not the tough russian <UNK> is the <UNK> who <UNK> both <UNK> and temptation goes <UNK> to his death and sets an heroic example for the villagers
<START> this is complete crap do not watch the main character is so f u c king concerned that the <UNK> bomb shelter is not big enough for everyone thus he claims the doc is playing god by saying who lives and who dies all during his he kills people without thinking twice and beats people to near death also the main character is an selfish little a wipe as because of him the doc who made the shelter died and his friend died he also killed several no name cops the main character is just a f u c king dumb <UNK> s h i t head that's got no concept of the greater good also this movie makes no f u c king sense tell me why a <UNK> would cause <UNK> activity if you say gravity i will f u c king rape you cause the <UNK> is smaller then the moon and you don't see the moon causing <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> br br why does a <UNK> cause atmospheric <UNK> the red lightning also why is it red in addition if you don't know the f u c king <UNK> been hit by thousands of times thats why there's f u c king everywhere on the moon the size of an object needed to <UNK> the moon into the <UNK> as portrayed in the movie would require a <UNK> around the size of the moon itself br br it takes huge amounts of <UNK> to cause an satellite to explode like that br br a goof in this movie is that the nuclear explosion in space resulted in a <UNK> shaped shock wave this is incorrect as in space the explosion should have produced an shock wave this <UNK> is also apparent when the <UNK> hits the moon br br also someone tell me why the commander the person who drives the big old broken plane suddenly felt the need to die i mean he's just like walking with them to the shelter then he stops he <UNK> the main character br br wtf the main character is also an ugly hole he's got a huge <UNK> and <UNK> hair disgusting br br stay away from this movie
<START> the movie is good and i think <UNK> <UNK> is very beautiful i liked the movie can anyone tell me how i can get hold of the songs from this movie even the soundtrack will do if that's not possible can i at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers i tried to look up amazon com but its not there i tried cd baby not there either i <UNK> through <UNK> to get some details but there weren't any i would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question i know that the songs belong to country music and is sung by a country artist i just need the title names along with the singer i would recommend this movie or rather the songs to any country loving person
<START> the genius that is stephen <UNK> was never more <UNK> displayed as it was in his 1979 musical thriller <UNK> todd a gothic gory grisly yet delicious musical <UNK> about a demented <UNK> who returns to london to exact revenge on the evil judge who not only had him <UNK> <UNK> from london but who is also raising his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to shield her from all the <UNK> of the world the <UNK> finds love sympathy and assistance from a lonely pie shop owner who has her own agenda where todd is concerned this musical <UNK> broadway and won nine tony awards including best musical and best actress in a musical angela lansbury the production was filmed in its entirety in 1982 with angela lansbury <UNK> her broadway role as mrs <UNK> the <UNK> pie shop owner who finds a practical use for the heads that todd makes <UNK> out of george who replaced <UNK> on broadway is <UNK> in the title role so much so that you have to wonder why he wasn't originally cast in the role lansbury and are riveting from start to finish and commit 100 to their <UNK> characters aided by a first rate score probably the closest thing <UNK> has written to an opera lansbury shines on the worst <UNK> in london and by the sea george stops the show with <UNK> and is also compelling during pretty women a <UNK> he sings with judge <UNK> the man he has <UNK> revenge on <UNK> is <UNK> impressive as <UNK> the young who <UNK> todd and falls for his daughter <UNK> <UNK> is a little over the top as <UNK> and really pushes <UNK> to the point that during green and bird she actually drives her voice off pitch during a couple of moments the rest of the cast is first rate especially edmund as judge <UNK> who gets to perform <UNK> in this production which was cut from the original production and ken <UNK> as toby whose gorgeous <UNK> fills the <UNK> on not while i'm around but it is breathtaking musical score by stephen <UNK> and the mesmerizing performance by lansbury an especially george that makes this night of gothic musical theater an experience that stays with you long after curtain call not for all tastes but if you're game and have strong heart <UNK> todd is a joy for all music theater lovers and a must for fans of stephen <UNK> and angela lansbury
<START> like all good art this movie could mean different things to different people to me it means that failing to open your hart to the others could rob you of happiness and leave you with an empty live the <UNK> of the <UNK> is like the junk food it feels good but eventually could make you sick br br almost everything i see in the us is a commercial mass production of action garbage shallow dramas and stupid comedies and this sensitive deep and poetic movie really touched me thank you <UNK> and all the other in the cast br br <UNK>
<START> it was 1983 and i was 13 i watched valley girl on hbo one night when my parents were working after it ended i wanted to talk with someone about it immediately turns out my best friend watched it too and it became our favorite movie every weekend after that we watched it until we could <UNK> it we woke her parents up late at night laughing hysterically we began to worship the main character julie played by the beautiful deborah <UNK> i am not saying this is a great classic although it is for me personally and i understand that the whole valley girl talk becomes annoying but that was the 80's but deep down at the heart of the movie it is a love story and a familiar but good one girl meets boy and there are sparks from both sides an instant connection <UNK> friends don't like him he doesn't fit in doesn't go to their school doesn't have money they like her better with her ex boyfriend the football player even though he is a jerk she makes the ultimate sacrifice her own happiness for her <UNK> happiness and she has these really cool supportive hippie parents it is one of nicholas <UNK> first movies and his first starring role one minute he is absolutely hilarious and the next incredibly touching and romantic his friend fred is pretty funny too if you were a teenager in the 80's you will love this movie or at the very least it will bring back memories it is no longer my favorite movie but it is still one of my favorites probably in my top 10 i am eagerly awaiting it's release on dvd if they ever release it you can go to deborah <UNK> website to sign a <UNK> to get it released on dvd and there are 2 <UNK> from the movie that are must <UNK> if you like 80's music
<START> based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war <UNK> and the snowman wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical and winds up falling short in both <UNK> it's less le <UNK> than who cares br br timothy <UNK> stars as christopher <UNK> a former <UNK> who disgusted by <UNK> and the middle class values around him is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy <UNK> for the cia sean penn plays his drug dealing pal lee who makes himself <UNK> delivering secret files to the soviet <UNK> in mexico city an offbeat <UNK> jazz score lack of sympathy or emotional <UNK> for anyone and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to what could have a decent moral dilemma thriller br br it's really <UNK> movie despite the second billing his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while <UNK> plays with his pet <UNK> <UNK> looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called action with penn it's a whether you get a brilliant performance or an over the top one here it's a bit of both but more the latter especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin he <UNK> he <UNK> he crashes russian <UNK> parties he gets <UNK> with <UNK> books he <UNK> at himself in a mirror a big he must have been saving for a <UNK> i don't know who my friends are anymore he cries out it's <UNK> to just watch him br br penn seems to have <UNK> lee somewhat on dustin <UNK> ratso rizzo from midnight cowboy complete with overly <UNK> line <UNK> and constant eye shifting john <UNK> directed this film as well as midnight cowboy but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind the graduate throwing up scene after scene of <UNK> and lee <UNK> trying to decide how to live their lives in their <UNK> cage too bad no one suggested <UNK> br br from the opening shots news footage of american decline <UNK> with <UNK> and his bird <UNK> makes clear it is a message movie though the message itself is far from clear probably because the characters never come into focus is <UNK> supposed to be an <UNK> or is he just a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> don't seem to know which makes it harder for us meanwhile opportunities to establish some suspense like <UNK> stealing documents from the top secret black vault where he works or lee playing games with the russians are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends it's the <UNK> of the story that <UNK> finds interesting but it's the least interesting aspect for us br br good stuff it's interesting to see a film that works the 1970s vibe so early as this one <UNK> maria <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> memorable in full metal jacket has a nice turn as paranoid colleague gene who shows <UNK> how to make <UNK> with a <UNK> but has some serious <UNK> issues beneath his <UNK> exterior <UNK> is also fine in a totally different way as the no nonsense boss who gives <UNK> his high security job david <UNK> as the russian <UNK> official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and br br but <UNK> and the snowman stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters and neither the actors nor <UNK> are able to mine much in the way of answers worse after more than two hours in their alternately <UNK> and <UNK> company you don't really want answers you just want those credits to roll
<START> a small town <UNK> <UNK> davis slowly begins to realize that she has suffered <UNK> and really use to be a secret government assassin soon there are men after her and a small time private detective samuel l jackson br br this was action packed with some great special effects and really funny one liners especially from jackson although the action may get a little silly at times who cares after all aren't movies meant to be a good time br br craig <UNK> is fun as a ruthless villain the movie itself was an all around good time just don't expect to have to think too much about it because then if you take it too seriously then the movie actually won't be fun but stupid instead br br this movie doesn't deserve to be called stupid or any other bad name
<START> this is a made for tv movie by hallmark hallmark has always made quality movies that are family <UNK> just <UNK> is a boy and girl fall in love while working together movie two <UNK> for a 250 000 prize against a field of professional <UNK> it is fun and light hearted the <UNK> look great the movie has a catchy upbeat little song played during the competition i assume that it is a made for the movie song by roger to bad that no soundtrack is available i would really like to get a copy of the song i don't even know the name of the song because the credits are <UNK> at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of <UNK> anyway the cast is great it is always nice to see brenda <UNK> she is very <UNK> and upbeat lauren holly is always a plus and <UNK> <UNK> rounds out the good guys with a wonderful performance professional chef <UNK> <UNK> has a guest appearance the movie is worth watching
<START> even for a 17 year old student who loves history and caught glimpses of emotion and excitement in his childhood years of this series its coming to dvd was a <UNK> for all time north and south truly is a series about friendship love honor you name your own list of feelings you get from watching this series i can still remember the first time i caught a glimpse of this series on tv when i was about 8 years old i though wow this looks exciting to bad i never had the chance to see book one and two on tv in the <UNK> when book three was broad casted as a late evening series in the <UNK> in the summer of 2004 i just knew i had to see the other two series to most people book three was a big disappointment as far as i know well since i have seen book one on dvd i must say that until now it is the best of the entire 3 books to all youngsters who just watch the fancy movies like the <UNK> oh america for freedom there is a more realistic view to see for them here
<START> i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the <UNK> on a e i've been fascinated with ghosts and the <UNK> since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when it's on scifi channel i've tried to watch three episodes of <UNK> state and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and <UNK> the notion that anyone who believes in the <UNK> is a <UNK> freak <UNK> state is beyond cheesy cheesy director's <UNK> voice overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy <UNK> going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything <UNK> on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the <UNK> like in <UNK> you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to <UNK> claims then take away what they can and they are almost always <UNK> to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil <UNK> state is not so bad it's good it's just plain bad didn't a e used to stand for arts entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now <UNK> as well
<START> the <UNK> 1943 is a genuine classic not for its story which is fairly routine but for its technical production elements this was a landmark western the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a columbia production a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation only <UNK> jesse james also starring randolph scott from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre although it would be <UNK> in a few years by the <UNK> and high <UNK> the <UNK> was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure br br in <UNK> the economy in the town of red valley <UNK> is based on <UNK> up and selling wild horses to the union army the script gets a little messed up here with references to the <UNK> which was several years away in future and <UNK> last stand <UNK> was busy fighting stuart in <UNK> at the time but these are not important plot elements br br red valley has an honest sheriff steve scott but the <UNK> and several citizens are corrupt robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses the town is visited by <UNK> rogers glenn ford a famous outlaw who is an old friend <UNK> he wants to go straight especially after falling for the pretty <UNK> stable owner alison <UNK> evelyn <UNK> partner <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> big boy williams is mainly there for comic relief as are uncle willie <UNK> edgar <UNK> and the town judge raymond <UNK> who models his character on frank <UNK> wizard of oz crystal ball <UNK> br br taking no chances with their huge budget columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but indians and covered <UNK> there is the best wild horse <UNK> ever filmed a spectacular <UNK> <UNK> an explosive climax romance and three strip technicolor all this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943 <UNK> is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy br br the cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming the <UNK> scenes are solid but it is the <UNK> <UNK> photography that is truly impressive both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences br br scott and claire <UNK> were top billed but the studio clearly wanted to promote ford who would soon be their biggest star and director charles <UNK> <UNK> the film to showcase his new wife <UNK> whose portrayal of <UNK> sister in gone with the wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films br br the ford <UNK> dynamic is the <UNK> most unique and important feature rather than go for the clich√© love triangle with scott and or <UNK> which it first appears will happen the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors this was probably the best role <UNK> ever got and she makes the most of it playing a <UNK> but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses and who rides and fights like <UNK> <UNK> character in pirates of the <UNK> this was revolutionary at the time and <UNK> with the 1942 <UNK> of the for wwii military service br br the <UNK> is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new unfortunately there are no special features on the dvd br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> i first saw this movie on tv back in 1959 when i was eight years old i knew nothing of westerns then but recognized ben johnson from the movie mighty joe young what attracted me to <UNK> master were the great songs sung by the sons of the <UNK> <UNK> c cooper who produced the movie was the first to <UNK> original music to fit the mood of a specific scene and so created the modern movie soundtrack cooper hired max <UNK> to create the mood for his classic creation king kong <UNK> would later win an oscar for the theme for gone with the wind ' cooper was also the producer of mighty joe young if you remember music was important to the big ape which would only respond to the sound of <UNK> <UNK> beautiful <UNK> in <UNK> cooper would partner with john ford who directed <UNK> master of all of ford's famous westerns this one is my favorite which features his brother francis and a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late <UNK> others don't quite make it examples like his new job and come to mind and i would also the in this category br br charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store and vice versa this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it and charlie is just an honest <UNK> but getting blamed for some missing objects stolen by other <UNK> br br there aren't many laughs in it except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the <UNK> for the rest quite disappointing br br 4 10
<START> also titled the magical castle this one is a stretch why bother why create another and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor <UNK> lake only some girlfriend of the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain stripped to to its <UNK> this is a <UNK> by a thread next thing you know some bird will have <UNK> the forbidden arts and <UNK> princess 4 the magical bird will be born thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close
<START> i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think br br if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think then look elsewhere this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this br br a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer why are we interested in the main characters what <UNK> these characters through their existence why do they make the decisions they make this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process there is no chemistry between these two actors both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role so why did they fail here i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either and when an actor doesn't know their audience can't follow br br in sum i have seen <UNK> flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought at least i have more interest in the <UNK> <UNK> who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a code <UNK> <UNK>
<START> there are two ways to turn a tv series into a film br br the first most common and least successful is to basically make a feature length tv episode see the disasters of the <UNK> son movie the second is to do something else something quite different <UNK> la monty python br br thankfully the creators of the cult tv series have gone for the second option and they've come up with something unique clever and funny it couldn't feel less like a tv episode br br try to get your head around this the writers playing themselves are confronted by their <UNK> <UNK> alter <UNK> played of course by them and told to continue writing the series otherwise apocalypse will <UNK> the village br br high concept contrived and easy to screw up yes but somehow they managed to pull it off not for every taste perhaps and the ending does drag but fans will be delighted and it might even win over the <UNK>
<START> i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made a <UNK> italian co production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all <UNK> speak english with some turkish words in between is hardly credible the english <UNK> is basically limited to <UNK> you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine apart from this racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight and if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white in order to create some tension we see the serial killer and hear him hum <UNK> <UNK> but we won't see his face br br i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin but the actors are not seen in those shot it's probably <UNK> with some german signs added here and there
<START> ali g was funny at first his interviews were fresh and original the idea of a mock gangster wearing <UNK> clothes and using street wise <UNK> was appealing at first br br but this film is just a rehash of old jokes the humour was mainly childish and <UNK> around the male sex <UNK> for the most part the film claimed good actors like charles dance but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2 d characters it is not but isn't really funny at all a second time it could be said that the movie was ali <UNK> last <UNK> of comedy after that he ran out of steam
<START> wow this is in my opinion the best sitcom since friends if you have had a crap day just sit yourself down with a beer if you are old enough that is if not a root beer will have to do and watch a couple of episodes it's the perfect recipe for happiness br br the thing i like most is that everybody in the show is very funny and they all have fantastic comedy timing after a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them i think the secret to the shows success is that they have an <UNK> life doug is fat but still happy with it he loves his wife his job and his friends the father in law is the fly in the <UNK> but hey <UNK> perfect
<START> brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night <UNK> bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble great twists and turns are totally and i do mean totally wasted in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description what is going on in a general sense is okay i mean the idea of a guy kidnapping <UNK> girls for <UNK> purposes is a good one the problem is that the details are so beyond belief that i would be shocked if you don't turn off the film in utter disbelief gee a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn't go any of the ways you know and you stay on the bus it get worse from there think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it even to the point where they could just walk away but never do whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film okay maybe there is the end the end is clever the end is the sort of thing that should freak you out it should be the oh moment and become a classic of horror cinema instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie one of the most brainless films of the year
<START> j j jameson from <UNK> 2 quote crap crap br br mega crap it pretends to be an homage un intentional to the <UNK> brothers done poorly br br there is no real mystery to the plot br br <UNK> performance is totally uninspired br br the quirky characters don't really work br br there are a lot of duh moments br br i love black comedy but this film isn't funny br br in my view it wasn't worth the electricity br br there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining br br i hope you find this review helpful
<START> i am a massive fan of the <UNK> i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series though different was wonderfully dark and imaginative the thought of seeing <UNK> edward and <UNK> on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for yet somewhere it all went horribly wrong the writers had no story and no real ideas the part set in old england showed the <UNK> of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film <UNK> provided the best of too few largely poor jokes and and <UNK> performances were big let downs if you love the league save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again and again a massive disappointment
<START> i <UNK> many students now <UNK> up for student exchange to <UNK> and being disappointed when they don't have quite such an exciting time br br the movie was enjoyable it's of course always a pleasure to see audrey <UNK> br br however i have a very strong issue with part of the movie the lesbian roommate tells <UNK> that women like to be physically dominated which i take issue with and shows him some sort of butt grabbing move that's guaranteed to get a woman <UNK> then tries out the butt grab on a shy married friend who starts out saying no no i'm married i'm married but then somehow <UNK> to the butt grab all of a sudden she's <UNK> yes yes and they're going at it on the <UNK> in <UNK> i found this really really offensive furthermore it is very stereotyped how often have we seen scenes where the woman says no but obviously doesn't mean it no means no grabbing <UNK> physical <UNK> isn't going to make it right it just totally supported the stereotypical rape <UNK> br br i wasn't even sure how to read the next scene where he <UNK> to the lesbian about how it worked and how next time he was just going to demand suck it slut or something like that did he really think forcing himself onto a woman with no respect for her feelings was the way to go br br this section really ruined the movie for me
<START> k <UNK> is exactly what a heart warming film should be the story is about a mysterious mental patient played by kevin spacey and his <UNK> psychiatrist dr played by jeff bridges the two have a very friendly bond and as their relationship grows dr can't help but wonder whether or not there is more to his mysterious patient who insists he is from another planet called k <UNK> this film is very funny and kevin spacey pulls of well placed one liners as if it was his second nature k <UNK> is a smart film and i wasn't expecting it to go where it did in the end i found myself thinking about the small things in life and the wonder and magic of the every day life we so often take for granted i left the theater with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and for families and couples on a date k <UNK> is a splendid film that will not disappoint i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous releases of glossy action packed gore <UNK>
<START> this young filmmaker has a talent for capturing his audience quickly with unusual camera work and sparse but intense scripts the concept here of combining animation with live footage is remarkably well executed and the soundtrack is very good br br the decision to release the movie in twelve parts online puts the <UNK> on the director to make each episode fascinating enough for the viewer to <UNK> in buying each upcoming episode i only wish all motion pictures had this kind of commitment to keeping their audiences entertained throughout their stories br br highly recommended
<START> this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody please explain the plot of this movie to me yes i know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert after the driver never noticed that his <UNK> wasn't <UNK> but what then and how did it end maybe i'm to stupid to understand this movie but to me it was an absolute waste of time br br my recommendation do not bother there are far better movies to be seen this movie ranks with my other all time low going overboard adam sandler and fire on the amazon sandra <UNK>
<START> when i saw this movie for the first time i was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant of the story it is a very artistic drama with incredible special effects spectacular acting not to mention a very excellent job in the makeup department jennifer lopez has pulled herself out of past roles that <UNK> into her career with this movie portraying a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of <UNK> to enter the minds of <UNK> patients to treat them vincent <UNK> played amazingly well his portrayal of a <UNK> serial killer was perfect to a t the sheer emotion conveyed by his performance is astounding vince vaughn isn't my favorite but still performed exceptionally well the symbolism and artistry was intriguing and <UNK> sometimes surprising and other times shocking overall i say this is a wonderful movie with excellent acting and beautiful artwork
<START> ok this movie wasn't good at all video games aren't what i would <UNK> on if i was over the age of 15 cool to play games but writing a comment about video game players may like this movie for that it is that is strange just play a video game don't make up a sorry story about getting trapped in one i use my cell phone i hope i don't loose my girlfriend in that grease being the worst ever ok grease has a very well thought out story along with being a musical even if you don't like musicals anyone would say grease is good my brother plays video games all the time and he watched 30 minutes and left because it was so awful i feel asleep
<START> 20th century <UNK> road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible <UNK> bore of a movie full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is <UNK> written by edward who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean <UNK> from whom one would expect a great deal more miscast is <UNK> <UNK> in the leading role <UNK> a lady who was capable of <UNK> about as much sex appeal as a blood orange is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar room torch singer handsome <UNK> <UNK> as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented <UNK> <UNK> who's role is little more than a bit part then we have richard widmark who has the most <UNK> written part in the picture when we first see him he is a nice o k guy who runs a <UNK> road house then suddenly and for reasons that are not <UNK> made clear he becomes insanely jealous of his manager <UNK> when the latter tells him that he is about to marry <UNK> you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but 1 he never <UNK> to her 2 they never had a relationship they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together and 3 without telling anyone including <UNK> he has <UNK> a marriage license wow so how widmark was to achieve something like <UNK> bliss with <UNK> after such a <UNK> is <UNK> huh well when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical his losing his <UNK> so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing he finally goes over the edge becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy <UNK> he laughably goes <UNK> for poor <UNK> <UNK> before biting the dust himself br br and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and <UNK> <UNK> there's not a single <UNK> shot in the entire movie added to this 95 of the film takes place at night br br besides an <UNK> press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a <UNK> widmark <UNK> at fox whatever <UNK> such a documentary is beyond me as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else however this <UNK> is <UNK> by such heavy <UNK> know <UNK> as robert <UNK> eddie <UNK> <UNK> and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this <UNK> and cringe inducing affair all i can say then it must be me i guess but road house up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so br br fox would do better if they <UNK> dvds of superior and thus far <UNK> widmark movies like down to the sea in ships 1949 and the colourful red <UNK> of montana <UNK>
<START> i just love this show it's so funny and cool is such a hilarious and interesting character i love him he's the thing that makes this show what it is although and are so funny and charming too everything about this show is great for me because it always manages to make me laugh no matter if it's only once an episode it's just so funny and all the characters are so lovable and cool it makes the show worth the time to watch unlike some crap on disney channel give this show a try next time it's on if you've seen the movie and even if you haven't seen the movie you'll find this to be very enjoyable anyway so go ahead
<START> an obvious cash in on the insert monster here on a plane gimmick flight of the living dead is about what you'd expect it to be br br the film has little or no plot which is what you'd expect from a film of this type although it is fun in parts i must say the zombie action is particularly entertaining once the film picks up it never stops the pacing is solid br br the practical special effects are pretty good but the cgi is terrible and distracting br br the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel let's hope that doesn't come to <UNK> br br if you're a die hard fan of the zombie sub genre of horror films i'd recommend it to you it's worth at least one watch however if you're just an avid fan of the genre leave it on the shelf br br 3 10
<START> please don't kill me i'm just an actor can you play dead it's difficult to describe this show it's like a crime <UNK> where the bad cop is an ass literally what's great about the show is some of perfectly awful one liners cracking out such gems as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> provides some great laughs at points sadly at other times the show seems to drag along at a slow pace making it almost hard to watch this is definitely the kind of show you'll love or hate there's essentially no it's not the best show on adult swim but it has some strong points it's worth looking into just to see if you enjoy it i know i did
<START> any person claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it otherwise i can't explain this <UNK> ninja <UNK> title br br the fight scenes in this movie are just <UNK> instead of casting franco <UNK> as the ninja they could hire some experienced martial artist instead in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie <UNK> fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar his kicks and punches are lame br br there's enough of old action movies with good action this is just a waste of time
<START> a little while ago i stumbled upon this dvd while <UNK> netflix and with such an impressive cast decided to give it a go br br never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie scarface and failing so spectacularly br br the main issue seems to be a complete <UNK> of what the story should be in scarface tony montana was the self <UNK> bad guy his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad it was a great and the only logical ending to someone who lived such a life br br <UNK> as director writer and lead actor sees <UNK> as some sort of hero or at least a complicated guy however he doesn't want to do the <UNK> work of creating a realistic sympathetic character he was raised by a white mother except for the six months of his childhood where his father a gangster himself showed him his life for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town approaches two dealers and says hey i'd like to buy some drugs he drops his father's name and in apparently no time they are not only rich the two guys who are <UNK> him are acting to him for reasons again never explained br br wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police <UNK> lies about him however since he's dealt large <UNK> of drugs before why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time the most obvious case of wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white <UNK> rapist played by gary busey in scarface tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself it's done he moves on but in this case they ham <UNK> have to make busey not only a rapist <UNK> but also a white <UNK> a little <UNK> don't you think i won't go into detail in this regard too much more but their desperate message of please like me i'm a complicated gangster fails on every level try as they might i didn't feel bad conflicted or sympathetic when his buddies are killed following a shootout his wife is also killed shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with <UNK> while his wife is in the car and his eventual demise br br suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy his only achievement bringing the term wooden to <UNK> new heights busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role tiny <UNK> did well <UNK> <UNK> is playing his warden from prison break role robert wagner is <UNK> for a paycheck faye <UNK> while a touch dramatic still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved brad <UNK> is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can and to give the film credit it does one up scarface in one way jennifer <UNK> now holds the title of most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent sorry robert <UNK> in short this movie had an interesting premise but a poor story arc unsympathetic characters and hit or miss performances i'd advise mr to ease up on the forced sympathy next time really we don't need to like your character we just need to be interested better luck next time
<START> if you live in the <UNK> are relatively well off <UNK> and do not really have much contact with the city life of england then this is the comedy for you not something a mass audience would go for but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces overall this is a comedy that the <UNK> at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a <UNK> few of the <UNK> comparing it to bbc <UNK> like only fools and horses <UNK> towers black <UNK> and other classics this series tends to drift away from the <UNK> regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture
<START> the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked <UNK> if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars stellar budgets and mpaa <UNK> money shots you will be very disappointed br br however if you are a fan of the old b movies with unknown but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well given the material some hokey but surprisingly well done special effects and very tight naked <UNK> bodies this movie is almost heaven
<START> blond main character always believes in everyone and when you stick together you can do anything shy guy best friend with curly hair rip off of wants to be a movie director has a secret crush on <UNK> spanish best friend rip off of miranda weird smart girl quinn rip off of and the popular stock up <UNK> logan rip off of kate and little brother max annoying rip off of matt br br <UNK> is the semi popular girl with 2 best friends the only thing it's missing is the funny little cartoon <UNK> <UNK> has and <UNK> duff was a lot <UNK> jamie <UNK> spears looks more like a tooth pick in a tube top
<START> i watched this movie probably more than 20 times the jokes are now 10 15 years old but every time i watch it it makes me fall off my chair two of the finest actor salman khan and <UNK> khan plays the lead roles here even if <UNK> khan is a much better actor and got the better role smart guy in the movie salman khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy all the characters are memorable this movie is filled with hilarious one liners and funny situations a little too silly probably don't try to look for logic in this movie let your brain relax for some time i promise it will be an experience to remember
<START> this contains some spoiler information but the movie is not worth watching anyway br br why ellen <UNK> and <UNK> wilson agreed to be a part of this <UNK> by writer director <UNK> harris is beyond me the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques which includes going to a party with a suspect and <UNK> that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female <UNK> and he sleeps with them all br br even more over the top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s m crime belong to a large yet secret group of s m lesbian executives br br full of bad editing and continuity errors the film is <UNK> in all of its <UNK> locations including <UNK> detective <UNK> apartment and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep br br <UNK> is a bad writer and a bad director he tried and failed miserably to create a atmosphere at times furthermore he couldn't get ellen <UNK> to give <UNK> i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying br br <UNK> were <UNK> wilson who wasted time studying with a <UNK> for the part the highly under rated character actor marshall bell gave his absolute best as always br br and since <UNK> couldn't deliver on any level it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters br br most importantly he doesn't know much about the real world of <UNK> and chose to create the typical hollywood reality of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous br br save your time money and <UNK> and pass this one by
<START> this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of comedies first of all i should not this film had no script just a <UNK> the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors which makes this film absolutely the cast is one of the best comedic you will ever see the story is about the dog show in philadelphia and some of the contestants in them parker posey shines and is absolutely great this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic <UNK> of the characters
<START> on watching this film i was amazed at how media perception can <UNK> a persons opinion of a celebrity karen carpenter was a <UNK> but very <UNK> young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to <UNK> the <UNK> with wonderful songs as with all celebrities of today they were often <UNK> about their music as well as their looks styles etc this had a huge effect on karen who <UNK> a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight which eventually caused her death this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching but on starting to view it then i was hooked in the same way that the tina turner story does then this film <UNK> you and allows you to see into the young performers life the acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made then the <UNK> and the dialogue are still entertaining br br i would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged
<START> oh where the hell should i begin give a brief summary of the story no either you've already heard it or don't want to either way it sucks much like the movie i happen to be a semi large horror movie <UNK> and i must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily executed movies i've ever had the <UNK> of viewing br br the script is <UNK> stupid the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest all of those torture scenes would have been a lot more effective if we gave even the <UNK> bit of crap for the characters since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet capt <UNK> how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them first off they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don't even know and second we don't even know their damn names why the hell should i care if they live or die not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards capt <UNK> after he's been <UNK> please i was cheering when he got his just <UNK> he deserved them hell he deserved worse also we're forced to sit through a pointless sequence lifted directly from the silence of the <UNK> and here it's done horribly of course he's gonna give them a false address and even if he had given them the real one don't you think he'd be waiting and not <UNK> some guy's johnson upstairs retarded br br then there's the dialogue everything captain <UNK> says is either laughable or just plain stupid the dead are so dreadfully dead when they're dead what the hell kind of crap is that dee <UNK> at one point says knowledge is power well if that's true this film has absolutely no power whatsoever br br then there's the plot holes yes i know this is a horror film well wannabe horror film but damn you could drive a semi truck into these holes first off these have got to be the dumbest cops i have ever seen ever i mean dear god these guys are morons call for <UNK> idiots second how the hell did that ring fall out of captain nose this <UNK> expert guy says that's the biggest one i've ever seen but if it's so damn big how the hell could it have fallen out so easily did capt <UNK> just leave it at the crime scene because he wanted to get caught they sure didn't make it seem like he did also they would never release capt <UNK> and i know that for a damn fact he would be in jail for the rest of his life and there's no getting around this much less let him return to his old house where he killed tortured everybody impossible and implausible br br and now the acting dear god did these people suck linda is the only thing good in this film she's <UNK> and amazing too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap amy smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence even the usually entertaining robert englund is underused and <UNK> here dee <UNK> plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever i never felt threatened scared or <UNK> i'd rather have seen dee <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> role in bride of <UNK> it would have been so much more fun to see this talent less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll br br dee <UNK> just plain sucks he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep and he's obviously dumber than freaking jessica simpson this film is just a way for dee <UNK> to show off all the weird crap he knows about self <UNK> and modern <UNK> and blah blah blah either it's been done before or it just didn't need to be done i was bored throughout the whole damn thing br br the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably it doesn't manage to scare shock or <UNK> in any shape way or form this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid br br gets a 0 out of 10 avoid at any and all costs not enjoyable in the slightest
<START> possibly the finest moment of tv at least in my memory as millions could watch shakespeare's gripping kings cycle richard ii richard iii play out on prime time tv i believe it was on friday nights no word was left out and the plays <UNK> in me who was then in <UNK> school a <UNK> for history and a <UNK> for shakespeare and drama br br let's see these <UNK> on dvd what a set this would be
<START> this movie is poorly written hard to follow and features bad performances and dialog from leads jason <UNK> and jennifer jason leigh the premise believable but weak undercover <UNK> agent <UNK> to the drug underworld deserved better than this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flop the competent supporting cast sam elliott william <UNK> others was not enough to save this film br br in addition this movie also contains the absolute worst love scene in cinema br br moreover the soundtrack is vastly overrated specifically the revolting sappy without substance tears in heaven by the otherwise legendary eric <UNK> br br rush is wholly <UNK> from beginning to end br br 2 of 10
<START> sometimes good things happen by accident br br i'd never heard of until late 2005 i was flipping channels and happened to see something on <UNK> disney with bats in a being attacked by <UNK> i had no idea what it was but i was motivated to stay tuned it was hard waiting for a commercial so i could find out what it was called br br part of what intrigued me was the looks of the bats first of all they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats extra fingers where their thumb <UNK> are supposed to be rather they have <UNK> like human hands but the fingers are longer and have <UNK> of skin between them br br also the faces they look like human beings in fact at one point i wondered if they had once been human but were transformed into bats <UNK> i don't like this in cartoon animals but it worked here the story is a human story even though it's about bats and other animals not unlike the lion king br br what i saw on tv were the last two parts of the trilogy i'd missed the very beginning of the first one towers of fire the second overall but for the most part i saw all of each of them however i found myself wanting to understand what was going on since the first part hadn't been on and i wouldn't have caught it anyway br br but i saw that it was based on a book by kenneth how fortunate that i paid attention and wrote it down i was very disappointed when i learned that the series wasn't available it wasn't even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yet br br however i did find not only the book but also the two sequels and when i read the first book i was left wondering is that it not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in that book but even had i not seen the animated version the book otherwise a good story doesn't end so much as it stops only one loose end is tied up <UNK> and <UNK> meet the colony at br br in fact and should have in my opinion been published in a single volume because they make for a complete story together but not <UNK> br br actually the animated version takes some elements from e g the <UNK> of the <UNK> from seeing the sun and some were completely original it's not perfect but it's definitely very enjoyable i enjoy both versions of the saga br br which is why i'm glad it's finally going to be available in june it was a long time coming and it's well worth the wait
<START> ok let's start with saying that when a dutch movie is bad it's really bad rarely something with a little bit of quality comes along <UNK> here in holland but not often <UNK> is about 4 girls going to spain to go on vacation party get drunk get laid u know the <UNK> it's also about the world of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> trying to lure the crowd into their club br br i'm not sure how long it took to write the script but i suspect somewhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes because you're watching a bunch of random scenes for 90 minutes long nothing and i mean nothing is believable in this movie it's almost too for words what happens with the storyline suddenly the movie transforms into a sort of karate action thing with a one on one fight with 'the bad guy in <UNK> and cliche car chase scenes <UNK> a <UNK> car can it be more cheesy also the words character development and casting are unfamiliar to the makers br br after having seen traffic 3 days before this i fell from sheer brilliance from a piece of art to this this is film making at it's saddest and don't start about low budget because even with a low budget you could write a better script it almost seems that the film makers were too busy <UNK> themselves to make a decent movie br br anyway the chicks in the water at the end made it up a little bit but for the rest of it don't waste your money on such garbage
<START> ok this simply is the worst movie ever made period horrible acting sets and music ok everything sucks in this movie i almost forgot the special effects are great also so if you like bad movies watch this it can surely make you laugh
<START> i sell the dead 2009 1 2 dominic <UNK> larry <UNK> ron <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> brenda <UNK> uneven blend of horror and comedy that poses as a valentine to the '60s horror films by roger corman and hammer studios with two <UNK> grave robbers <UNK> and <UNK> facing final <UNK> for the crimes via the <UNK> but not before their tales of the occult can be <UNK> in flashbacks amusing and a few well <UNK> <UNK> but really a mess of a b movie trying in vein to be a cult classic largely thanks to the casting of genre vets <UNK> and <UNK> to no <UNK> a good rental for halloween <UNK> glenn
<START> i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film i found it very entertaining of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura <UNK> is a bonus when i first heard about it i thought it would be along the lines of a role <UNK> weird science and to an extent this is true however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming having seen the trailer on the dvd which i hadn't seen before watching the film i saw that the twist is actually shown in the trailer very strange br br as the film progresses the weird science comparison fits less and less and i think this is the better of the two films certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast br br in summary i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci fi chick flick and i don't think i've seen many of them
<START> i thought this film was excellent quirky and different to the usual run of the mill cop catching serial <UNK> film <UNK> sutherland was brilliant as usual i really don't think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly the dialogue was funny at times <UNK> the mood and the plot engaging thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with alice in wonderland i hadn't picked up on those i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of <UNK> as i am and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours it was a shame that it wasn't released at the cinemas for a wider audience
<START> to this day malcolm <UNK> is telling anyone <UNK> enough to believe him that the sex <UNK> were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to be used to make him money there is a good reason for him doing this namely that he is a liar br br here are some real facts br br <UNK> was actually approached by the band to be manager not the other way round br br the <UNK> were a proper <UNK> band and not created by <UNK> or anyone else jones and cook were childhood friends rotten and vicious went back a long way too this is something that has led to unfair criticism of the <UNK> down the years as they have been <UNK> to <UNK> boy bands br br the band and no one else wrote the songs recorded them played live created the publicity and gave the interviews br br <UNK> did not <UNK> the bill incident the <UNK> only appeared on the programme because queen had pulled out according to the band <UNK> was <UNK> in the back in case <UNK> were about to be made br br johnny rotten walked out of the band he was not <UNK> br br far from the sex <UNK> john <UNK> rotten actually successfully <UNK> him in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money some of the evidence used by lawyers was from <UNK> <UNK> in 'the great rock roll this would suggest that <UNK> is none too bright despite his <UNK> br br the and subsequent pay offs from a m and <UNK> were again not <UNK> it was merely the way things <UNK> out br br <UNK> boasts about the money he made from the band if he had been competent he could have made a great deal more it seems he even <UNK> <UNK> properly br br <UNK> claim at the start of the film that he invented punk rock can be <UNK> in about ten seconds the <UNK> were not the first punk band merely the most high profile br br this is a terrible film the only parts worth watching are the genuine footage of the band later put to much better use in 'the filth and the <UNK>
<START> first half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally i'm not easy to scare but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well but still very scary a good thriller than use simple ways to make good horror <UNK> set in russia unknown cast and made in europe but still great fun and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well
<START> this film is just plain lovely it's funny as hell and as old as the hills the acting is superb and it's fascinating seeing post war britain and how we used to behave in those days this seems to have been some pre runner to the st <UNK> films given the <UNK> <UNK> and margaret <UNK> connection there's also a very young george cole in there who appeared in many st <UNK> films but i don't myself understand the connection it was shown on recently after a biography of st <UNK> creator ronald however i missed enough of the biography to miss the connection with this film anyway a great film in its own right and something that should be <UNK> for all time
<START> when i was 13 or so i was lucky enough to find this film it was part of an endless danish series of really cheesy stuff this however was the <UNK> i ever owned but i guess i sold it too bad well what to write better than <UNK> the hands of fate and worse than <UNK> 4 but it's definitely worth an hour and a half since this was made by people who wanted to make it the acting isn't that terrible compared to several other eighties trash in fact i kind of like the old man even though he look that indian to me but i guess you can't have everything do yourselves a favour and look this up
<START> if anyone at national lampoon is reading this please stop the crap your pulling out of your bum really now why the hell are you doing movies like these they're not funny and watching it for the sexual content is a complete waste of time really it is such a horrible movie you may want to shoot yourself while your watching it i am serious here guys it makes and kumar go to blah blah blah look like an actual good movie and we all know that h k is one of the worst movies ever made it really sucks it really does how bad it is well even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie they'll want to murder the director i swear to god i hate you national lampoon die already die
<START> as a fan of old warner brothers gangster movies i had to check this out its the 2nd best movie in the adventure classics dvd set that also had one of my favorite movies scott of the <UNK> on it this was made in 1939 a good year for a lot of warner brothers movies it boasts a great cast john garfield claude <UNK> ann sheridan and the dead end kids who would be later known as the <UNK> boys at <UNK> pictures well a boxer garfield gets framed for a murder he <UNK> commit and is on the run and being <UNK> by a tough new york detective claude <UNK> he ends up at a fruit picking place run by a pretty woman gloria <UNK> and the dead end kids <UNK> hall leo <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> billy <UNK> bobby jordan <UNK> he later returns to boxing but tries to keep a low profile this was directed by famed director busby <UNK> who directed timeless classics like <UNK> street of 1933 and 35 <UNK> parade and many others i would like to give a shout out to <UNK> dvd video for putting out a lot of good budget <UNK> dvd's like adventure classics see my scott of the <UNK> review i give they made me a criminal 10 out of 10 great movie ill have to point out that i have only seen 2 john garfield movies this one and body and soul i thought he was a very good actor
<START> i can think of no movie that better captures the concept of grace in a <UNK> sense the well <UNK> <UNK> of a small <UNK> gone awry after the death of their leader <UNK> from them the very thing they <UNK> grace the <UNK> gift of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> genius returns them to their calling to love one another and an aging general concerned that he's wasted his life choices is a central theme as well as grace at the same time artistic <UNK> is recognized as having a powerful <UNK> role to play in everyday life and the life to come impossible to improve or ignore this is a life changing film for those who hear its message
<START> the director <UNK> delivers the goods with somewhere in the city this hilarious farce i believe is in the tradition of a mel brooks comedy <UNK> fun at new york society by creating the believable eccentric and tragic characters of one <UNK> apartment building bringing them to life from the very opening one shots that introduce them peter <UNK> performance as a gay shakespearean actor is absolutely award worthy and the film in general does a good job at showing the <UNK> and laugh ability of self centered ambition sandra <UNK> is cast perfectly as the straight self obsessed <UNK> i really enjoyed <UNK> performance immensely especially since i haven't really been a very big fan until now <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and round out an international ensemble par excellence i loved the scene with robert john burke and his gang of idiot criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives <UNK> on it with a cameo appearance by mayor ed <UNK> and a solid performance by paul anthony stewart the revolutionary <UNK> boy somewhere in the city entertains without missing a beat
<START> very <UNK> intelligent drama about a group of international <UNK> held virtual prisoners in the <UNK> of 1956 by <UNK> russian communist regime kerr and <UNK> play lovers she a british <UNK> he a hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country other new york theater stars of the period anne jackson e g marshall play an american couple traveling with their two young sons including <UNK> howard in his screen debut jackson's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon to be communist country she gives an <UNK> <UNK> in the third act of this film which <UNK> the <UNK> acting styles we've come to know today from redgrave fonda streep leading the pack of soviet wolves is <UNK> <UNK> magnificent as a <UNK> and at his <UNK> since he played opposite kerr in the king and i he is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely <UNK> heroic kerr this is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the golden era of american film do not miss it
<START> this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites br br even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its <UNK> and this may be biased but i'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway br br it does contain a lot of good ideas the subtle <UNK> element the <UNK> under the eyes the gory and disturbing deaths and the <UNK> clich√© flashback br br <UNK> include the heavy metal soundtrack acting and the ending br br all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end br br a fairly good film from <UNK> but he as done better a lot better
<START> we've all got to start somewhere it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like <UNK> <UNK> could learn his trade before turning out good films in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25 1945 br br the war on europe was over for almost two months of course not even harry <UNK> could control the events of history so i'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese another very bad historical <UNK> was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater the cloak and <UNK> stuff was the territory of the <UNK> in that part of the world br br when you're an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina <UNK> he's about to go on a mission to the <UNK> to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general <UNK> in china against the japanese <UNK> germans who've been <UNK> otto house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who've already lost the war trying to help their allies who by the way they refer to as <UNK> when <UNK> is <UNK> by a <UNK> car and knocked unconscious she dreams about <UNK> danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge she goes there and <UNK> the plot br br all the stuff you'd expect from a nice noir film is there the <UNK> atmosphere of san francisco the <UNK> lit sets <UNK> <UNK> tried his best as did the cast but they just weren't convincing probably because they didn't believe this <UNK> themselves br br it's possible but not likely that nina <UNK> dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor i think it was just a lousy screenplay br br and <UNK> and harry <UNK> at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here
<START> so it's a space movie but it's low budget you ask what about the effects the effects are at times good and at times really really bad i mean bad and notice i started with the effects br br there's a story here but it's told in what i think is the wrong order i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order i mean it's told in a completely nonsensical <UNK> most of it's about a mother in the future because you know it's sci fi as told by her daughter which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective only once you're through the first hour and hear paul voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it this narrative is so constant and <UNK> that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour br br there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action this one does then please hire a good fight choreographer otherwise your fights will look like well what's in and notice the title has the word battle in it ugh br br i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept and some effects my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as <UNK> 1 8 million when you compare it to something like <UNK> which did better with a budget of a few thousand you realize in low budget film making it's all about the story i wasn't expecting much but i was still disappointed two out of ten stars
<START> am i the only one to notice that the realism of the 19th century ship is <UNK> actually it's a <UNK> century right around if memory serves me because the realistic ship in the movie is the now as far as i know the never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia i don't know who handled r d for this film but using the and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed br br they even <UNK> it on the cover art and the dvd i wonder how may other people noticed this little <UNK> not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful i would have expected better from sam <UNK>
<START> this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie br br 1 <UNK> miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a game at texas tech this means he won't get anything done during the season at all and chris <UNK> comes up sooner on the team br br 2 the game against marshall was lost at marshall the team depicted as marshall was actually high one of main rivals and here is the proof marshall high is the <UNK> colored scarlet and silver high is the colored purple and gold look at the <UNK> and you will see who it is also the real marshall <UNK> football <UNK> is <UNK> black the team shown was <UNK> mixed like high br br 3 only loses to lee by one point in district play lee loses to high and high loses to these are the teams that set up the <UNK> toss as such br br 4 <UNK> comes back on the team as a <UNK> to chris <UNK> and after not getting any playing time in the lee game he <UNK> the team completely at half time and never stands on the <UNK> or goes to any games again br br 5 brian chavez was a tight end and <UNK> end who wore 85 not a tight end and strong safety in addition <UNK> wore 35 and <UNK> christian wore <UNK> br br 6 the <UNK> end up liking chris <UNK> as a player more than <UNK> because he has a better <UNK> <UNK> and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too this is in part why <UNK> <UNK> the team br br 7 dallas carter is played in austin at <UNK> k royal <UNK> stadium where <UNK> plays in the state semi <UNK> not the state <UNK> carter wins the state title but is forced to <UNK> due to an player br br the acting is done pretty well but if you read the book you will see these flaws are pretty true i am also tired of hearing all the pc <UNK> out there complain about the depiction of dallas <UNK> football team the team according to the book is as large monstrous talented and black as the movie shows people say it is a racist depiction but reading the book you see a true depiction of the team the story is very altered giving this movie a score of 3 5 10
