<START> i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit and his <UNK> 11 director steven soderbergh worse we picked this up in a <UNK> bin for 4 99 canadian dollars at that what a grand and pleasant surprise but then i'm of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can't be disappointed this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s ok with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut <UNK> funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of <UNK> in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best 5 i've spent in ages
<START> this was the first movie that joan crawford and clark gable made together and they would go on to make several more crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother they have never worked before and the brother william <UNK> gets a job with gable who is a gangster and <UNK> thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on their is a massacre in which several of <UNK> men are killed and crawford was a witness to the whole thing it's a good movie but not one of their best
<START> this movie is terrible <UNK> way 1993 is a great film <UNK> it isn't but its one of the better crime films done this movie should be considered closer to the <UNK> <UNK> or maybe speed zone remember those gems the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original this movie lacked everything de palma pacino and penn worked so hard on there wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it i hope rise to power wins every <UNK> it possibly can and maybe even <UNK> some new categories to allow it be a record <UNK> after i watched this s t fest movie i sat down and watched the original <UNK> way to get <UNK> bad taste out of my mouth after watching this i wish <UNK> came and whacked me out of my misery
<START> randolph scott is leaving the usa for the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> british columbia he wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner bill williams and cook lee <UNK> <UNK> they <UNK> their small herd over a <UNK> bridge <UNK> by victor <UNK> later <UNK> <UNK> their cattle and williams loses his left arm during the <UNK> br br from 1945 until <UNK> when he retired randolph scott made a series of good adult themed westerns some of them considered real classics unfortunately the <UNK> trail will never be listed among his best westerns br br it's more like the material that roy rogers or gene <UNK> might use the story is downright silly at times williams who was along for the ride with scott he wanted to go <UNK> for gold as there was a big strike at the time he doesn't blame the <UNK> he blames scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm br br also there's a scene in the film when scott lee <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> hayes are captured by indians they escape because <UNK> <UNK> has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the indians allowing our heroes to escape i'm not sure that would have played in a rogers film br br furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that <UNK> <UNK> randolph scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from <UNK> <UNK> hayes on how to find gold br br this was <UNK> <UNK> farewell feature film part it would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with randolph scott before this br br i will say this though no <UNK> made any appearance in the film this is one of the few canadian locale films from the past that did not have any <UNK> br br but if i were you unless you are a big fan of randolph scott or <UNK> hayes take the next <UNK> off the <UNK> trail
<START> <UNK> beach <UNK> gives b grade t a films a bad name as a fan of the genre i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and <UNK> sex scenes what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think
<START> the story line was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts behavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john <UNK> doesn't really satisfy me playing a semi <UNK> chess player not to speak of the italian player motives weren't very much <UNK> either br br
<START> i came here for a review last night before deciding which tv movie to settle in front of and those i found made this one look <UNK> how <UNK> i feel br br firstly it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a <UNK> daytime movie the performances are wooden every sentence is an attempt at <UNK> in the way that <UNK> daytime movies and bad soap operas always are and it is based in that predictable and well <UNK> premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and <UNK> the whole movie is about the <UNK> apparent in the moments when the male characters <UNK> to develop a second dimension br br if that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you then be warned linda <UNK> german accent while quite good is painfully distracting as is her face for some reason the other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their <UNK> with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day there are few surprises but do watch for the <UNK> <UNK> endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry <UNK> <UNK> br br i wasn't expecting action but i had hoped for beautiful or <UNK> or emotionally charged what i got was a particularly bad christmas <UNK> story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the <UNK> of it all br br watch it under the <UNK> circumstances 1 there's nothing else on 2 you are a fan of predictable <UNK> takes on men and <UNK> tv movies 3 the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film 4 you've <UNK> enough <UNK> that your emotions are easily <UNK> by <UNK> storytelling
<START> h g wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in <UNK> very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades great cast includes raymond massey <UNK> and old <UNK> sir cedric <UNK> ghost of frankenstein ralph richardson time <UNK> and <UNK> scott early glimpses of <UNK> <UNK> a rocket ship and futuristic cities this film was ahead of its time directed by william cameron <UNK> <UNK> from mars its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis <UNK> but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come that was made in 1979 this movie has nothing to do with the original h g wells like jules <UNK> had a vision for the future with his stories a classic science fiction movie 10 out of 10
<START> i had a recent <UNK> experience with the perfect witness 2007 because the netflix computer recommendation engine suggested i watch this film apparently at some point i told it how much i liked michael <UNK> <UNK> video i don't know about you but this parallel being drawn <UNK> in me a <UNK> of emotion and excitement over thomas c <UNK> film and made the <UNK> of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse just this kind of recommendation from the netflix computer intelligence for me had the aesthetic moral movie bar set to level so high that upon reflection it represented something pretty much <UNK> in every film produced in the year 2007 br br having <UNK> my response to the film that way i'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal and i really hate to do that because i think our boy wes <UNK> happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema but also one its most overlooked and underrated <UNK> talents in the us i'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps <UNK> around with first time movie directors like this br br the perfect witness is about <UNK> wes <UNK> who about thirty still lives with mom you're not <UNK> again area <UNK> but he's a filmmaker or at the very least some kind of street level <UNK> with a <UNK> for shooting would be <UNK> in the seedy back <UNK> of philadelphia with his <UNK> <UNK> out there doing his private investigator like <UNK> <UNK> inadvertently video tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early twenty ish <UNK> with his hand held camcorder <UNK> the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural <UNK> can be his <UNK> with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto and not to the <UNK> of his <UNK> friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films <UNK> approaches the <UNK> james <UNK> mark <UNK> also takes a writing credit or mac the knife <UNK> and <UNK> the killer into making a documentary about his murder <UNK> holding this found footage over the <UNK> with <UNK> of the police br br the problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do while both the writing and direction are amateurish that alone doesn't make a film bad it's that these guys commit a rather poor <UNK> that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can <UNK> on to the web and catch the <UNK> of the action of a <UNK> on their little mac or pc no film relies on shock value alone any more unless of course ironically it's a film about torture on animals and therefore cinematic images of violence real or fake have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes also we've got this astounding actor talent in the lead all <UNK> up real hip guy his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it backwards just like the <UNK> from high school who <UNK> after the potential services of my primary love interest <UNK> guy who just now calls himself a poet br br spare me i'm an artist i'm a filmmaker okay please do carry on with that <UNK> <UNK> seems to have bought you a lot of expensive <UNK> stock and go ahead you can wear all the <UNK> of a creative but don't expect us top respond to you to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down wes <UNK> career why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do filmmaker guy my guess is history will eventually have say something about that <UNK> probably that's in not is good as you think it is and yeah odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear <UNK> ma end up like our man <UNK> here in the perfect witness hooked on <UNK> and covered in your <UNK> blood with a video camera in your hand great
<START> how can a movie have <UNK> <UNK> and still suck i just don't get it trick or treat managed to do it this sucks and likes it br br trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about it is a vomit inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself trick or treat has no redeeming factors br br for a movie about heavy metal it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986 probably one of heavy <UNK> strongest hours that is quite a feat however negative br br trick or treat so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it that simple <UNK> will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and <UNK> film
<START> summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what's the <UNK> movie of the week given 99 9 of the screens dedicated to screening it ok so i may <UNK> on the <UNK> but you get my drift besides stuff from hollywood bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters and from some of the trailers shown i'm hyped to watch them too tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 but i was quite surprised at the lower than low <UNK> at the cinemas when i watched <UNK> <UNK> it was a full house but it wasn't for tashan br br after watching it i knew why it was entertaining but it was <UNK> weak just like it's literal english title which means style tashan is all style but little substance not that it doesn't have the usual star power but scenes felt forced and some <UNK> on a tad ridiculous even for bollywood standards i must say which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who wrote <UNK> and <UNK> 2 both of which i enjoyed tremendously br br in his rookie directorial outing with tashan while you can't fault his direction you'd probably scratch your head over the plot which was clunky at best it tried to force too many things into the story though credit be given where it allowed you some <UNK> to question character motivation but that came a little too late and only toward the finale which left you guessing for just a moment before it <UNK> into full blown action <UNK> many a <UNK> action movie with hong <UNK> <UNK> and hollywood's ludicrous <UNK> and <UNK> with zero <UNK> and in a <UNK> to include everything including the kitchen sink you have an assortment of vehicles appearing and the one that took the cake in a <UNK> 2 homage was the <UNK> boat in the middle of nowhere br br at best tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy and this is attributed to how the cast <UNK> up with their characters saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff a call center executive who gives english <UNK> only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material his playboy ways gets <UNK> aside when he meets with <UNK> <UNK> kareena kapoor who's not exactly who she seems the meek and sweet natured <UNK> she <UNK> <UNK> services for her boss mobster <UNK> anil kapoor who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah <UNK> does it and to complete the <UNK> akshay kumar plays bachchan <UNK> an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by <UNK> to hunt down jimmy and <UNK> when they escape with money stolen from <UNK> business br br so begins a road trip of sorts with friends who turned enemies and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all because he goes from zero to hero <UNK> moves that would shame rambo in absolutely no time which is quite out of character kareena kapoor <UNK> up the sex factor as she uses her charms to <UNK> both men and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much <UNK> bikini scenes and other costumes that <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> way above the <UNK> every character has a <UNK> created and i thought akshay <UNK> bachchan <UNK> was probably the best the most touching and the most fun of the lot even though his character seemed a lot like a non green incredible hulk with his gravity <UNK> leaps and power <UNK> punches his wounds also <UNK> automatically which <UNK> puts <UNK> to shame and the best part is his theme song which is damn <UNK> male and played in <UNK> <UNK> mode each time he takes on <UNK> br br but sad to say that's the only tune that is memorable something that cheers bachchan <UNK> bachchan <UNK> for most bollywood movies i watch i will usually be able to despite the obvious language gaps emerge from <UNK> <UNK> a tune or two i wasn't able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just weren't catchy at all usually the song dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location that i enjoy versus <UNK> them out and <UNK> them into extreme settings high <UNK> a mountain or <UNK> <UNK> rocks on the beach front br br tashan probably didn't take itself too seriously but coming from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> story you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous and for continuity to be a little more careful as well billed as a blockbuster now i can start to understand why the crowds have already <UNK> this one despite akshay <UNK> stealing the show tashan could have been better on the whole
<START> ok people honestly this gotta be one of the worst movies about show <UNK> that's ever been made but i've been laughing myself silly which may be why i enjoyed it basically it's all about sex sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie if you have a thing going for <UNK> characters and easy entertainment watch this movie when you get the chance and don't have something better to do br br attention spoilers the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat on the show and flashing his <UNK> with his <UNK> pictures a triple a for bad taste and fun
<START> all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus <UNK> the <UNK> although the children were much more sadistic in <UNK> i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie as a spanish assignment in spanish 5 we all had to watch it i'll tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr pitch was going to do next would <UNK> help santa claus or would his robot <UNK> come and save the day i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that d
<START> i love don <UNK> let me just say that up front he is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is portray a nervous <UNK> <UNK> loser thrown into a position of authority he is fabulous in this role as roy <UNK> the reluctant astronaut but the film is pretty dull really even though as a kid my brother and i delighted in watching this and his other films it's still worth watching but really it's a film that is best enjoyed by children i'd <UNK> it as 100 family friendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family night br br as with all of <UNK> films there's a great cast of beloved character actors and you can't help but smile when <UNK> gives one of his shaky open mouthed stares no matter how old and jaded you are br br from an adult perspective one thing i think that is great about this film is how it captures <UNK> in the 1960s all the new modern buildings the hope the optimism the future and i was surprised at how suave and <UNK> leslie <UNK> was back then only complaint about the story is <UNK> love interest a rather <UNK> unlikeable woman who can't give him the time of day until he becomes a big shot if you're like me you'll be hoping that he gives her the <UNK> off at the end beware you'll be <UNK> the theme tune for days after watching it's that catchy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films i have seen in my life that it did not win the oscar i will not shed a tear this movie is in a kind of class of its own that an oscar win would possibly have <UNK> from it my <UNK> friend <UNK> <UNK> you have done true <UNK> with your pen here kay <UNK> with your creation and everyone <UNK> you all have given a gift of love to our world between the points of entering this world of <UNK> then <UNK> it you really can say that you made it better a special personal thank you from my soul to all of you that you brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life i grew up in sweden and my young mind and present <UNK> was formed and shaped by many beautiful swedish influences individuals traditions music and nature my <UNK> with <UNK> to you all with love and light george gabriel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> south africa
<START> national treasure 2004 is a thoroughly misguided <UNK> <UNK> of plot <UNK> that borrow from nearly every cloak and <UNK> government conspiracy cliché that has ever been written the film stars nicholas cage as benjamin franklin gates how precious is that i ask you a seemingly normal fellow who for no other reason than being of a <UNK> of like minded misguided fortune hunters decides to steal a <UNK> <UNK> that has been hidden by the united states <UNK> fathers after a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably unintentionally like indiana jones meets the <UNK> the film <UNK> into one misguided <UNK> after another  attempting to create a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of nicholas cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> and logic to having george washington and his <UNK> crew of <UNK> <UNK> a king's <UNK> <UNK> on native <UNK> and then going through the <UNK> plan of leaving clues scattered throughout u s <UNK> art work is something that director jon <UNK> never quite gets around to explaining couldn't washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country hence we are left with a mystery built on top of an <UNK> that is already on shaky ground by the time ben <UNK> himself the new <UNK> of this <UNK> wealth ben's intentions are noble  if confusing he's set on protecting the treasure for who and when <UNK> guess is as good as mine br br but there are a few problems with ben's <UNK> first up his friend ian holmes sean bean decides that he can't wait for ben to make up his mind about stealing the <UNK> of independence from the national <UNK> oh yeah  brilliant idea presumably the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune so ian tries to kill ben the assassination attempt is of course <UNK> if overly melodramatic it also <UNK> ben the opportunity to pick up and pick on the very <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> chase diane <UNK> she thinks ben is clearly a nut  at least at the beginning but true to action romance form <UNK> resolve <UNK> <UNK> than you can say is that the hope diamond the film moves into full x file ish mode as the fbi <UNK> believing that ben is behind the <UNK> <UNK> in various <UNK> ways that lead to a multi <UNK> of action sequences reminiscent of mission impossible meets the fugitive honestly don't those guys ever get <UNK> information that is correct in the final analysis national treasure isn't great film making so much as it's a <UNK> rehash of tired old bits from other movies woven together from <UNK> the likes of which would make <UNK> <UNK> ross <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> dvd delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of the <UNK> widescreen picture <UNK> a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors natural flesh tones solid blacks and clean whites the stylized image is also free of <UNK> and digital <UNK> the audio is 5 1 and delivers a nice <UNK> boom to your side and rear <UNK> with intensity and realism extras include a host of <UNK> <UNK> material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made if only as an audience we had had more <UNK> as to why ben and co were chasing after an <UNK> treasure this might have been one good flick extras conclude with the theatrical trailer audio commentary and deleted scenes not for the faint hearted  just the thick headed
<START> a dog found in a local <UNK> is <UNK> with satan and has a <UNK> of <UNK> one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit run the puppy wants no time in making like donald <UNK> and firing the mexican <UNK> how <UNK> only the father suspects that this <UNK> is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic <UNK> so it's up to dad to say the day br br this late 70's made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail <UNK> but <UNK> it as an adult i now realize that it's merely lame boring and not really well acted in the least bit br br my grade d
<START> i liked top gun it held my interest predictable plot decent character development and story line it is pretty similar to high <UNK> in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain this movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles denver <UNK> was a good looking man in his younger days john <UNK> rod taylor are outstanding in their roles sterling hayden did the best that he could with poor material it is hard to imagine him as a <UNK> laura played by karen booth was a nauseating character she seemed <UNK> that two men may have been fighting over her ugh finally how can people travel without <UNK> especially women
<START> vanilla sky was a wonderfully thought out movie or rather <UNK> los <UNK> was well thought out i watched that movie late one night excited about what was to come i wasn't disappointed by the end of the movie i was <UNK> i couldn't get it off my mind the whole idea of it just blew me away the ending was more of a surprise than <UNK> could ever do the plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through the cast superb it was an all around wonderful movie the kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new i've seen it four or five times and i'm always finding something new it's a movie to keep you interested forever
<START> i haven't actually finished the film you may say that in this case i have no right to review it especially so <UNK> but i do only because i stopped it on account of i couldn't watch anymore i got over halfway and i only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner this film is so tiresome so lackluster that i was actually insulted i haven't read many of the other reviews so i'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it but i am homosexual and i did go through similar revelations day dreams issues etc etc there were maybe two moments where i actually felt this film could go somewhere where i felt it may have some <UNK> of meaning or <UNK> but these hopes were <UNK> the moment the next set of cliché ridden narration came on i mean just look at the quotes on the imdb page unfortunately you're not able to hear the <UNK> play back nor the echo <UNK> fades if you're just read the quotes because they are just too painful ridiculous stupid to miss i did give the film three stars and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to <UNK> <UNK> tired concepts into something watchable mind you i pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of tv closeups another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as <UNK> <UNK> i think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at sundance only because archer had connections in the festival via <UNK> work he did by the way because sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as <UNK> no it's not art house i'm afraid it's just plain s t house do not watch
<START> first off the title character is not even the main character of the movie he is the sidekick of the cult leader the actor who portrays <UNK> believed that screaming loud laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while <UNK> out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people <UNK> also had the annoying habit of yelling because he never actually just spoke in a high pitched voice he would also say idiotic one liners for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw <UNK> upon seeing this yells out paul no paul <UNK> you do it i could have cut her clean so clean in another scene <UNK> tells a victim that she would have to <UNK> her own tools for surgery because right now it was his time to operate ' aside from the bad acting the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax which is <UNK> getting a <UNK> arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining <UNK> <UNK> the movie offers no explanation of this only telling the viewer that <UNK> escaped from the mental hospital what bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this
<START> kris kristofferson at his drugged out peak in the mid 70s finds himself barely able to squeeze on to the screen alongside la <UNK> <UNK> ego and <UNK> store <UNK> br br none of the characters are really likable i was so glad when <UNK> <UNK> went over that hill and crashed br br if you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom try the buddy holly story made only about a year and a half after this dreck
<START> this bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and <UNK> of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie this installment tries to <UNK> away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke but it takes a wrong turn and <UNK> nowhere interesting or funny br br there's almost a half hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert and lots of people watching on free tv since when does that happen surely the script writer could have done something more creative look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a <UNK> them at the science presentation not in this film which pretty much ended the bill ted franchise the joke was over br br the grim <UNK> is tossed into the mix for whatever reason this <UNK> like the whole plot is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement there's a <UNK> top impression <UNK> in for no reason there's lights smoke mirrors noise but nothing really creative or funny br br skip this bogus thing
<START> i make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the sci fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find as such i'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when i saw <UNK> of oblivion the acting was <UNK> sub par as opposed to the woefully <UNK> display sci fi usually has in store for us there are a few cameos made by people you'd most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart the cgi special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci fi feature is lacking sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets <UNK> by a <UNK> or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he's known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointment br br if i was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made for tv movies i'd probably give it a 4 maybe even a 5 a real shame that i may have to wait <UNK> the next sci fi original movie to get a good laugh and i really hope that this movie isn't part of some overall quality increase in sci fi original movies
<START> i tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler i also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general <UNK> so if you haven't some of this might not make sense br br plot this movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical <UNK> again and again in an attempt to get the theme across we are <UNK> again and again by questions of purpose and destiny and choice and forced to endure the long <UNK> <UNK> sessions that contain them br br neo <UNK> from a dream in the last movie now begins a period of realization about his own existence there are a lot of revelations in this movie which i'll be vague about so they won't seem like spoilers br br if you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie don't read the paragraph below br br the strength and weakness of faith is revealed the strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed the <UNK> of humans and technology and our faith in technology are also revealed the importance of choice and experience is revealed explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail so i will <UNK> as the <UNK> for writing a commentary asks btw by revealed i mean <UNK> through our ears and eyes like nails br br storyline so how does neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one in short they keep the faith and use and abuse overly stylized action and bullet time like it's going out of style and after this display i'm hoping movie goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more more on that later to not spoil anything i will say no more than the <UNK> material already did neo is still trying to figure out the matrix and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans and <UNK> all while baddies are going after him and his <UNK> the movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off br br action while martial arts action and <UNK> <UNK> its predecessor in somewhat equal parts this movie focuses much more on martial arts than <UNK> adding swords <UNK> etc to the mix special effects are so often used and <UNK> in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome i've discussed this movie with friends and <UNK> alike and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences especially the smith fight we all heard would be in the movie to be too long and tedious this is a huge red flag for action fans because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more or completely content with the <UNK> that just <UNK> br br these fights scenes do neither they are over stylized over the top sequences that are wooden and uninspired in the first movie there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action a sense that fighting was for survival not just looking good which i honestly don't think they manage in <UNK> anyway in black and leather go watch drunken master or iron monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are you won't regret it in addition the matrix abilities people have in <UNK> is not consistent and what they actually do is not consistent the first movie had its inconsistencies here but they weren't too glaring unlike <UNK> br br special effects are <UNK> on and on and on every little thing someone does be it just jump <UNK> spin and in many cases just pose are br br slow <UNK> bullet timed or over <UNK> by some sort of destruction it's evident the w bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie and boy did they throw it with no real restraint sharp <UNK> could have really helped this but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given which brings us to br br character and dialogue i have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical <UNK> actors can't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is <UNK> character progression audience's face or <UNK> it altogether the audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own br br <UNK> acting performance is stiff at best keanu is good at acting confused and that's about all he does in this film he makes a decent attempt to show passion between neo and <UNK> but it falls flat br br lawrence tries to make <UNK> everything from <UNK> to henry v and be as cool as a cat throughout with the script he is provided he makes a noble attempt but it also falls flat br br moss isn't very believable either her look of concern is always the same much like <UNK> and the chemistry isn't there although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough br br hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an agent program but he too suffered from the <UNK> hand i actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge drawn out fight scene br br all in all this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations and on its own as a stand alone movie which is not how it's supposed to be taken it's still horrible i don't see the matrix as deep but i at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas good action a few funny lines and enough restrained symbolism and <UNK> to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> fails on all these counts and i really hope the w bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment granted i don't have a lot of hope left for that after this film
<START> below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ordinary script direction with full of <UNK> salman khan was at his usual acting <UNK> performance <UNK> with time as his looks especially his styles as a rock star were pathetic <UNK> was just a <UNK> only overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema salman khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to <UNK> khan there were many songs in the movie all boring except man <UNK> <UNK> the most important song to impress the uk music <UNK> was most unimpressive <UNK> can be very easily understood by an english music <UNK> the other movie i saw last week was wake up sid which was simple slow love story with good direction acting despite average music
<START> the film belongs to <UNK> underdog genre jake <UNK> laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting <UNK> to story with several standard elements well filmed well edited with plenty of well acted secondary roles br br some have <UNK> this movie to be classic american hokey it is that and more i agree with those who say the movie <UNK> the thrill of youthful inspiration br br the film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots br br
<START> just imagine what school would have been like in a world like this the kids are one big gang who have really good taste in music and <UNK> against bad <UNK> and teachers rock <UNK> roll high school is taking place in that world it's like a ramones record coming to life the characters are all as silly innocent and charming as the <UNK> songs and the music itself is of course fantastic high school comedies have really changed over the years if you compare a movie like american pie with this late 70's classic where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all since a remake is apparently in the works it can probably be expected that the charm of the original will get lost along the way and will get replaced by vulgar half funny dick jokes as bill <UNK> used to call them however the main problem will be that the ramones cannot be replaced they were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even come close to taking their place so the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone as quirky and charming as it is <UNK> <UNK> hey
<START> this is an excellent but hard to find <UNK> world war i spy thriller in the <UNK> 60's italian style from the psychedelic graphics of the <UNK> credits and the great score by <UNK> <UNK> to the lesbian love scene with <UNK> and the <UNK> produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german <UNK> in full gas proof <UNK> <UNK> gear this is a movie that should not be missed it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the <UNK> of the players on and off the battlefield apart from the battle scenes some of the production and special effects are primitive apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes but for lovers of 60's cinema it should not be an issue i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the <UNK> to tape it on vhs i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time
<START> a town called hell aka a town called bastard a british spanish co production was made on the heels of clint eastwood's success in the italian made man with no name trilogy the <UNK> used in most of these films was to hire recognizable american actors whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices this film is no exception except for the fact that they used some british actors as well br br it's difficult to <UNK> the plot but here goes the story opens with rebels or whatever led by robert shaw and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a church and killing everyone inside including the priest fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the shaw character is <UNK> as a priest the mayor of the town telly <UNK> is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of <UNK> out justice with his gun br br throw into the mix a <UNK> widow <UNK> stella stevens who is searching for her husband's killer add to this the fact that she rides around in a <UNK> lying dead like in a coffin for god knows why after the mayor is murdered by his henchman la <UNK> al <UNK> the town is <UNK> by a <UNK> colonel <UNK> in search of a rebel leader i'm sorry but the name escapes me the colonel takes over the town and begins <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> to force them to reveal the identity of the leader br br even though they opened the film side by side its difficult to tell from the dialog that the <UNK> and shaw characters know each other a blind man <UNK> <UNK> claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face he does so and br br i'm sure the principals <UNK> making this film it's just plain awful and well deserving of my <UNK> 1 rating shaw spends most of the film <UNK> his trademark stare at <UNK> is handy even <UNK> can't salvage this film the beautiful ms stevens is totally wasted here too having just made <UNK> the <UNK> of cable <UNK> the previous year i found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie <UNK> made several of these pictures <UNK> villa and horror express come to mind during he pre <UNK> period michael craig is also in it somewhere as a character called <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two french connection films al <UNK> would also emerge with a role in the godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his <UNK> death in 1975 br br in all fairness the version i watched ran only <UNK> minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or <UNK> minutes listed on imdb however i can't see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference br br avoid this one
<START> <UNK> was the last movie i've seen before getting married just last year br br it was also the first movie i've searched for after i was married because we promised to offer a copy to our priest br br sometimes reality is not that apart from fiction to all those who wrote that priests like don <UNK> don't exist in real life i would recommend them to visit my priest <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> br br to all others i would only recommend them to see this movie before and after the i do day br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is <UNK> and i loved it the dragon lord <UNK> chan and his buddy cowboy totally made the movie fun meaningful and just plain silly the movie is a rare blend of a good vs evil fight and somehow the wonders and fun that is growing up long <UNK> <UNK> takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young dragon lord so named because he is the son of a wealthy family and cowboy which include <UNK> clever elaborate ways to escape studying with the help of the entire household including the <UNK> competing in rather <UNK> and <UNK> interesting ways to gain the affection of a local girl competing in soccer you will see what i mean and the list goes on somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a <UNK> of valuable <UNK> and the lives of several people br br the movie has its serious moments but they do not <UNK> but rather inspire the <UNK> of the boys are not lost in this exchange but is actually employed against evil what i really loved about this movie is how it ends not the typical confrontation which in itself was awesome but well you'll see let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie br br silly witty meaningful and nostalgic great movie
<START> i thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy i have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is a <UNK> who can play and sing anything br br i am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding <UNK> performance in lucy even some <UNK> tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn't really look like lucy my response to that is so what i wasn't looking for a superficial <UNK> of lucy i wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth i also didn't want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore i was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits <UNK> and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach i thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart i also thought rachel was <UNK> fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were <UNK> the professor and the <UNK> <UNK> in particular there was one moment in the <UNK> scene where the corner of <UNK> mouth had the exact little <UNK> that i remember lucy having i couldn't believe she was able to capture that and so naturally br br i wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of i love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years i think rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right <UNK> for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept <UNK> what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br i believe that rachel <UNK> captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and <UNK> that was totally endearing lucy was a star turn for rachel york i hope it brings a <UNK> of great roles her way in the future i also hope it brings her an emmy
<START> there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked this was not one of them br br it was <UNK> and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera it was <UNK> predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking that's it once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable this is one movie that would have wound up on <UNK> if it was still on
<START> when we started watching this series on cable i had no idea how <UNK> it would be even when you hate a character you hold back because they are so beautifully developed you can almost understand why they react to frustration fear greed or temptation the way they do it's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of <UNK> learning <UNK> br br i can't understand why <UNK> would put up with <UNK> abuse of her <UNK> physically and emotionally but i just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior <UNK> has a dream house endless supply of expensive things but i'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband or maybe not that's why i watch br br it doesn't matter how many times you watch an episode you can find something you missed the first five times we even watch episodes out of sequence watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language a e with language <UNK> reruns on the movie network whenever they're on we're there we've been totally spoiled now br br i also love the <UNK> an <UNK> around my neck is my favorite of johnny boy when these <UNK> have entered our family <UNK> it is a sign that i should get a life i will when the series ends and i have <UNK> all the dvd's and put the collection in my will
<START> band camp was awful the naked mile was a little better and this third straight to dvd in the american pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor basically <UNK> <UNK> john white split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity and now him and mike <UNK> <UNK> jake <UNK> are joining <UNK> cousin dwight steve <UNK> at college with the promise of many parties plenty of booze and enough hot chicks at the <UNK> house they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official <UNK> members but a threat comes into sight with the rivals <UNK> geek house led by power hungry nerd and sheep <UNK> edgar <UNK> savage offering bigger and better than what <UNK> have to settle it once and for all <UNK> and <UNK> go into battle with the banned for forty years greek games to beat each other in with the loser moving out the last champion of the games <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> dad the only regular eugene levy runs the show which sees the people <UNK> <UNK> a gladiator duel floating on water catching a <UNK> pig russian <UNK> in the mouth with <UNK> of aged horse <UNK> wife carrying and drinking a full <UNK> of alcohol with <UNK> not <UNK> it all comes to the sudden death with a guy getting stripper lap dancing and they have to resist <UNK> <UNK> house win when edgar <UNK> with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap also starring <UNK> christopher <UNK> as mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as ashley dan <UNK> as bull <UNK> <UNK> as bobby christine <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as laura johnson <UNK> <UNK> as sara coleman sarah power as denise <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and jordan <UNK> as rock the nudity amount is very slightly <UNK> as is the <UNK> of the jokes and i could guess it being rated one star out of five but i like it adequate
<START> most people who chase after movies featuring audrey <UNK> seem to not understand that <UNK> was a character it is not really audrey <UNK> real life personality hence every movie she <UNK> in is not going to be <UNK> part 2 part 3 etc br br now with that said i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it yes it's true there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min but i didn't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters the guy who lies about everything is too funny the guy who <UNK> people who run out of his <UNK> and skip out on the bill by finding <UNK> and such which balance out the loss actually getting into all the characters here could take quite a while but this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while br br audrey <UNK> character irene is not the overdone <UNK> girl that <UNK> was in fact as irene her <UNK> to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first in this film irene is a girl with good intentions but over the course of a very awful day her <UNK> becomes more and more sour and <UNK> br br what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building very entertaining to watch great scenery and shots very colorful and never too slow and all of the characters can actually act the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left this is when all of the plots start to <UNK> together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense and the whole <UNK> effect <UNK> i swear it was the best 20 minutes of film i've seen in quite a while and the ending it made me think damn i really <UNK> out finding this movie the ending to this movie is top notch whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together and in a sensible manner which is the case here but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a <UNK> to build up this whole <UNK> effect very impressive br br i highly suggest this movie as it's a great film to watch anytime in any mood with any company or alone
<START> i'm not quite sure why but this movie just doesn't play the way it should it should be <UNK> and fun but instead is just boring i think a large part of it is because they way over played the <UNK> the old cartoon it is based on is much better br br 3 10
<START> although i like kurt <UNK> i'm not particularly interested in spy stories and i didn't know this one the only reason i watched it was nick nolte who is one of my favorite actors since i saw breakfast of <UNK> and hotel <UNK> but the film brought me a pleasant surprise of course nolte was great but so was the plot there was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral question by reading his anti <UNK> radio <UNK> with hidden secret messages to americans he in fact contributed to the general attitude of germans and as it later turns out americans towards jews or hitler which carries more weight his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti <UNK> the dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken not even as narration howard campbell jr nolte is a person who <UNK> to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up not even in his <UNK> the inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray but with the help of excellent acting and photography this film manages br br there are other points to it such as the humor or the <UNK> use of romantic clichés like the song white christmas that make it real different from average american movies i recommend it to everyone who is bored with hollywood spy movies
<START> i <UNK> had this movie on my shelf for a while in a mill creek collection and one night i just decided to watch it though not expecting much as the beginning credits roll around i'm surprised to discover this film was made under the <UNK> company <UNK> brought the world such amazing <UNK> as <UNK> 2 <UNK> the <UNK> and quest for the mighty sword so i was compelled to watch br br as the movie started out it had potential to be pretty decent even though it was unoriginal the gore scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent but after a while into the film the pace started dragging and i found myself thinking okay someone better get killed soon or someone better <UNK> at the <UNK> of this drag when i was having these thoughts though someone may have gotten killed or have mutated however as noted the gore and effects weren't very good what made matters worse was that the scene transitions were confusing example first dr <UNK> would be at the <UNK> then he'd have a flash back about possibly killing someone finally he'd wake up in a cold sweat in bed making the audience ask was he dreaming he was at the <UNK> like the movie's pace these scene transitions got <UNK> worse br br i could try to say the character development of dr <UNK> was pretty good but towards the end of the film that is once you've seen what the doctor has <UNK> into hopefully you'll laugh which really is the only reason to see this movie at least once this movie unintentionally runs like a long <UNK> joke br br the costume of the um thing that doctor <UNK> becomes can also be seen in joe <UNK> <UNK> quest for the mighty sword which was made in the same year you've gotta love <UNK> movies they're always re using the same stuff
<START> page 3 out of 4 stars br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enters her <UNK> house and its empty she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture <UNK> another girl  that two timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it's a guy this time around and i say <UNK> ' br br end of spoilers the above scene is not a spoiler really but for me it was so i didn't want to take a chance br br when asked upon as how was this film my friend answered <UNK> it just an <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more when i went to the theater i thought to myself <UNK> i better get a pen and a paper to <UNK> down the bad things about this <UNK> but i was proved entirely <UNK> and then some because i could <UNK> only the goods this film was great great not because it is offbeat and <UNK> cinema like storyline but because of the <UNK> in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is grace she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part one of the most charming actresses i've ever seen but this is not the only performance which is good in the film there's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> particularly <UNK> <UNK> who just fires up the screen and guess what even the unusually <UNK> tara <UNK> speaks normally br br the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the <UNK> <UNK> celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it even <UNK> <UNK> agrees to that statement  <UNK> was a good story <UNK> thank you the great thing is that it <UNK> the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also <UNK> the social issues and does not make them boring in the end its all a roller coaster ride and <UNK> informs us that by just smiling at all these people just the reason why i love watching films <UNK> film making the screenplay is beautiful clever and witty
<START> although it has been remade several times this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time creative dialog unique genius in the final scene it deserves more credit than critics have given it highly recommended one of the best comedies of recent years
<START> i'm not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching but enter the <UNK> is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action michael <UNK> wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in english shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter even better with the leg fighting than her dad but her acting skills are also sub par in fact all the english dialog 90 of the movie even more than in gen y cops is so bad that i switched to <UNK> audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the <UNK> of the english <UNK> sure there are some decent <UNK> but nothing we haven't already seen before and good cinematography but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action br br that said it's worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny the jet <UNK> go at it spectacular and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for br br finally you might notice some scenes that seem familiar to you notably a shootout at an <UNK> market think matrix and <UNK> diving out of a helicopter wearing black <UNK> think <UNK> 2 guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off
<START> this is one of the very worst films clark gable made only <UNK> was obviously worse it is just so painfully clichéd and the dialog is so lousy that it is something neither gable nor jean harlow should have been proud of making br br gable is a <UNK> whose illegal activities result in his girl <UNK> to the <UNK> like the gangster talk she holds out hope that he'll do the right thing but he just leaves her there unknown to either of them gosh that she's in the family way eventually the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow they tie this all together into a happy ending they seemed to have forgotten about <UNK> needing to take the rap and spend several years in the <UNK> leonard <UNK> says the stars are at their best here by what standard best at producing <UNK> chuckles <UNK> a break br br ps after saying this my wife thinks leonard <UNK> is going to find me and kick my butt hmmm however despite my comment i think mr <UNK> is the finest reviewer and human being on the planet i hope that <UNK> him br br update 2 2 <UNK> because i disliked this film so much the first time especially the ridiculous ending i decided to watch it once again after all sometimes when i watch a film again i like it much more and realize that i was a bit too harsh while that has been the case with several films in recent months i still disliked this film even the second time most of it was not because of the first half of the film in the first half <UNK> character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable but when she was sent to prison it was all clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred the bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb it just makes no sense at all and is akin to turning the movie into some wacky fairy tale instead of a love story about two cons i stand by my original review despite all the not <UNK> and think that aside from <UNK> and possibly polly at the circus it might just be the worst gable film
<START> short synopsis br br this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men one of them <UNK> another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays <UNK> turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the <UNK> they lose all <UNK> <UNK> so it is really serious with exposed well built and well <UNK> <UNK> they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women one gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion a last encounter a last light for a cigarette <UNK> <UNK> farewell friend br br i found it hard not to see closet <UNK> in the two main characters played by classical he man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and charles bronson they are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is <UNK> and marked by contempt throughout the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic <UNK> a little like deliverance it is also very stylish the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and <UNK> tower it is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall <UNK> around the wardrobe is also very good the ultra stylish <UNK> <UNK> maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement br br i can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone <UNK> and bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting both do a considerable amount of <UNK> i have never seen bronson better than here he really acts and speaks french throughout with a heavy accent buy very <UNK> indeed and it is certainly the man himself we hear so the french language version is highly recommended the police inspector who <UNK> the two is played by on of my favorite <UNK> character actors bernard <UNK> who was gene <UNK> partner in french connection ii he is the best <UNK> police inspector i know also very good is former child actress <UNK> <UNK> as the young <UNK> who as it turns out is not so innocent as it first seems br br anyone who expects the <UNK> in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake
<START> i loved this series when it was on kids wb i didn't believe that there was a batman spin off seeing as the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997 first of all i loved the idea of robin leaving batman to solve crime on his own it was an interesting perspective to their relationship i also liked the addition of tim drake in the series and once again like it's predecessor this show had great story lines great animation better then the original fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing the only thing that i didn't like was that was when it was in the us it would often run episodes in a 15 minute storyline i just wish some of the episodes could be longer my favorite episode of any batman cartoons comes in this series and it's called over the edge in my opinion as good if not better then heart of ice and <UNK> <UNK> overall a nice follow up along with superman this show made my childhood very happy
<START> despite some moments in heavy rain an encounter with a drunk as well as an <UNK> <UNK> with a gypsy and a monkey and a stay in a <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st john is only <UNK> amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of <UNK> in drag <UNK> with buster that's the ultimate in meet cute scenes especially since it's one of the few times we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movies also many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of <UNK> of the film stock still if you're an <UNK> or keaton <UNK> good night nurse is certainly worth a look
<START> nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics people are so easily <UNK> by nostalgia these days and while some of those shows were are undoubtedly good this one is just pure crap i watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on tv back then and even as a child i didn't like it even a 8 year old can see how much the people in power rangers are overacting and how much the special fx sucked even back then when the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad <UNK> scenes it <UNK> the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teens and <UNK> little social problems every now and then i don't know about you but i didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all and its basically filler until they have to <UNK> some dude again in a very cliché alien costume with fireworks or some toy robot you never feel <UNK> in some kind of way with this show and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides <UNK> <UNK> just enhances the lack of feeling br br there is really nothing memorable about this show and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin offs <UNK> is a good example all it is is just a quick way to make some money though i challenge any <UNK> to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because i couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children my guess is that most <UNK> of power rangers will tell me that i just don't get it anyway or something along that line i really don't care though this was crap back then and it still crap now
<START> lars von <UNK> europa is a worthy echo of the third man about an american coming to post world war ii europe and finds himself <UNK> in a dangerous mystery br br jean marc <UNK> plays leopold <UNK> a german american who refused to join the us army during the war arrives in <UNK> as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the <UNK> <UNK> what he doesn't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies leopold is strongly against taking any sides but is drawn in and <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> barbara <UNK> the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the <UNK> company her father was a nazi <UNK> but is <UNK> by the american colonel harris eddie <UNK> because he can help get the german <UNK> system up and running again the colonel soon <UNK> or forces leopold to be a spy without giving him a choice or chance to think about it to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains br br soon leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir ish way where everyone and everything is not what it seems its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything his lover the terrorists the colonel annoying passengers his disgruntled uncle even the <UNK> <UNK> officials who come to examine his work <UNK> before he finally <UNK> over and <UNK> and violently takes control the film is endlessly unpredictable br br the film <UNK> shot it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout also background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front add max von <UNK> hypnotic narration and europa becomes a <UNK> place that's out of this world br br this is now a personal favorite film of mine
<START> la <UNK> i la <UNK> the breast and the moon describes the life of a 9 10 year old boy named <UNK> who is obsessed with breasts growing up in <UNK> i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human like all the characters in <UNK> <UNK> movies also director of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age also being from <UNK> north east of spain it brought lots of memories to my mind this movie shows how beautiful <UNK> is nice people nice life and specially lots of non uptight people
<START> i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again 20 years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980 but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like <UNK> and <UNK> hold up much better today than this steaming <UNK> no t a no great jokes except for the one liners we've all heard a million times by now br br i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits not the smash <UNK> others had mentioned and the frequent voice overs were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was <UNK> what the character's lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then br br the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say
<START> this story is dedicated to women according to the introduction who have been fighting for their rights ever since adam and eve started the loose <UNK> system when politics was filmed the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> women the right to vote was only a decade old and the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> down <UNK> was a main concern for women at the time br br good natured marie <UNK> as <UNK> burns becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a <UNK> she wants the <UNK> selling <UNK> closed and is <UNK> into a <UNK> run after delivering a powerful speech at a women's <UNK> ms <UNK> is supported by her <UNK> best friend polly <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> and her <UNK> husband <UNK> <UNK> as peter <UNK> <UNK> run for mayor of lake city draws opposition from men in town so <UNK> orders the women to go on strike denying them everything in the <UNK> bedroom and bath br br the film sounds much better than it turned out the humor frankly isn't too good and it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations you look like <UNK> queen refers to an <UNK> and andy character and the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well this time producers might have considered making the film more dramatic focusing exclusively on <UNK> and the characters played by william <UNK> as benny <UNK> and karen <UNK> as myrtle burns br br politics 7 25 <UNK> charles <UNK> marie <UNK> polly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> probably jackie chan's best film in the 1980s and the one that put him on the map the scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes during which a <UNK> village and shopping mall are <UNK> there are clearly differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter the latter is also <UNK> by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals in fact the only thing the dubbing has <UNK> is the court <UNK> the time trials in colonial hong kong were <UNK> in english while the original has this scene in <UNK> br br nonetheless chan's fighting style and the martial arts choreography <UNK> humour where possible so non <UNK> audiences don't miss much it's not after all the dialogue that makes a chan flick but the action and the painful out takes the story is easy to follow chan plays an <UNK> hong kong detective pursuing a <UNK> godfather <UNK> <UNK> and assigned to protect a star witness <UNK> lin the action is superb from beginning to end and there's not much time to breathe in between it'll never get you thinking but what an entertaining and well strung together film arguably this is one of the best martial arts films out there
<START> i wanted to punch the tv watching it was torture i hated it never watch this movie the terrorists are annoying adam sandler is annoying i normally like him but not in this one i wanted to break the dvd this is the most irritating film in the world the comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone if you even like adam sandler a little bit don't buy it it will just make you hate him do yourself a favor if you see it in the store hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it its a waste of the 1 99 i paid for it
<START> this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs and not the typical little mermaid beauty and the beast type songs but ones that are <UNK> entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative i'm in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child
<START> having low expectations going in the opening new footage <UNK> at over five minutes of <UNK> came as a pleasant surprise i won't say the new footage was grade a material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all original film br br unfortunately this was put together in 1955 during a time of one day shooting <UNK> after the new footage jules white decided to just <UNK> stock footage from <UNK> <UNK> into this short making for a not so smooth story transition which jules and felix <UNK> try to <UNK> with a <UNK> bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn out ending of the boys moe larry in this case getting shot in the butt br br 3 10
<START> probably encouraged by <UNK> of her much better orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually co writes the music including a <UNK> love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic <UNK> are as fascinating to us as to her but <UNK> character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of <UNK> <UNK> as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked she just can't act whether playing herself or not pretentious over ambitious dull and silly
<START> this movie is deeply idiotic a man wants revenge for a crime but when he <UNK> his revenge there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time what man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera br br just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me but it got dumber br br i am thinking the script writers have some serious <UNK> that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an <UNK> of <UNK> tanks through br br plot a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong and then the unexpected unfolds br br if only these people writing this story hadn't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way to the writers i say seek help for your serious mental problem
<START> i saw this movie in the theater when it came out i grew up in <UNK> and i went to arizona state and really enjoyed seeing locations where i spent so much time i remember at the time thinking that <UNK> venture into more of a rock sound actually r and b to my ears was a successful one i was never a fan of <UNK> singing until his last effort for new west as a <UNK> and an actor though he has serious chops imho i think it is a fine romance i like it better than the judy garland version and never saw <UNK> janet <UNK> original br br i do believe that they made some changes in this long <UNK> dvd release among other things i recall the helicopter shot which reveals a packed sun devil stadium being longer and more dramatic i wish they had done a better job writing music for kris or god <UNK> put some of his original songs in there br br along those lines i have some information from a primary source that says that the music was a problem for kris and barbara while doing interviews for my own new music documentary <UNK> the boat a musical conversation and journey i interviewed stephen <UNK> a fine singer <UNK> <UNK> with close professional and personal ties to kris bonnie <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> among many others stephen was in <UNK> the john norman character's band kris was having a real hard time turning what was essentially a pop score into something that could pass for rock stephen was and is <UNK> friend and long time band member there was tension on the set and at one point the band was <UNK> at kris in <UNK> presence she <UNK> to the effect that the band shouldn't talk to him like that kris came right back to the effect that they were his friends and they were rock and roll in the end barbara came around and decided to use <UNK> <UNK> live performances in the movie and specifically <UNK> <UNK> role in making things work i gained even greater respect for her as an artist upon hearing this story much is made of her as a <UNK> what she is is a pro and i am not gay not that there is anything wrong with that
<START> although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film and more than once after that the plot development is disjointed and slow the verbal <UNK> of the main character's only friend is practically <UNK> the base quality of most of the characters actions and the <UNK> way in which they are treating is annoying br br it is typical of <UNK> <UNK> to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters however this faux <UNK> analysis is a big step down from <UNK> or <UNK> where the characters <UNK> and despise each other for well <UNK> reasons that play out during that film in <UNK> <UNK> we are forced to follow the <UNK> of a truly <UNK> intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that i won't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any <UNK> out <UNK> is he <UNK> through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his <UNK> attention even though i watched the whole thing i wasn't made to care even for a moment about either of them br br if you can sit through all this prejudice ignorance betrayal bad dialogue flimsy philosophy <UNK> the camera work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the dogma group the makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst i've seen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in any of her movies while in person she is actually attractive br br i suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower <UNK> of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then <UNK> has achieved his objective the <UNK> of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a <UNK> true that i heard much of the male audience <UNK> in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes br br save yourselves and watch something else
<START> with a movie called <UNK> from outer space how could you go wrong just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters use the village people as the main <UNK> for the soundtrack and throw in tons of gay gags plot is <UNK> too bad this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot the characters all look alike apart from the german <UNK> one or two jokes work the rest fails br br the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film my expectation were to high apparently
<START> yeah i'm sure it really could be a nation if four of them all stood at the four <UNK> of the world and the other two <UNK> themselves a few billion times man i am really glad that i saw this movie on fear net instead of renting it i'm a big fan of the george romero movies and i'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie he'd probably throw up while laughing too hard i mean what was with the <UNK> girls posing as zombies and walking around like charlie's <UNK> it really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop police station apartment flat whatever room it was with the <UNK> in the background and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop i couldn't even tell what <UNK> the killer was and the fact that his accent <UNK> some multiple nations didn't help either oh well what can i expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world so for all of those who worship mystery science theater 3000 or if you just like <UNK> on bad c movies c for <UNK> then this is the movie for you or not
<START> <UNK> is one thing i can say about this movie personally i'm one of those people who loves cats so that would have been a big down side to the movie but i loved it how cats from every were got their revenge at the end br br i liked the movie but i have to admit it was because i found brian <UNK> who played charles brady very very irresistible i guess lust got the better of me while watching this movie br br there was one thing that i was disappointed over i've watched <UNK> before and brian <UNK> is married to holly marie combs his kissing scene was o k in <UNK> but really bad compare to his kissing scenes with holly marie combs i don't know if it is because <UNK> and combs have great chemistry or maybe more it a bit more that was the only disappointment in the movie but i guess it was made up for with brian <UNK> in those tight ass <UNK> he was wearing in the movie br br if you are use to seeing brian <UNK> as holly marie combs heavenly husband and the father of her son your in for a big surprise with this movie he was nothing like angle boy although now that i think about it it would be great to see <UNK> character on <UNK> taken over by evil making him something like his was in <UNK> br br i also have to say the music was great in this movie too
<START> i love the frequently <UNK> masters of horror series horror fans live in a constant lack of <UNK> projects like this and the similar <UNK> project with gave us feast like it or <UNK> it are <UNK> grounds for wonderful thought <UNK> in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to <UNK> food for we who love to <UNK> on horror br br this one began with a <UNK> of really <UNK> idea and ran right off the edge of where in the world am i going with this br br i don't know how to spoil the spoiled but spoiler ahead all of a sudden no there was that light <UNK> across the night sky earlier we have long haired <UNK> aliens huh huh brain <UNK> males and yeah i get it but well the worst curse of storytelling a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement br br cue to <UNK> your build up has to have a payoff that <UNK> build up not the other way around storytelling <UNK> 101 br br end of spoilers big <UNK>
<START> the story young <UNK> is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg in the institution she meets park <UNK> sun a young man who develops a bond with her br br if you're reading this you probably already know how talented chan <UNK> park is but <UNK> a cyborg ' is a big departure from familiar and sadly stronger territory i'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different god knows we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas the main point about the movie i need to say is that it fails to say anything about mental illness or create a characters that you care about br br this story has to be one of the <UNK> things i've seen in years but weird isn't enough there's no heart to the movie just <UNK> and confusion confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie the characters all try to make sense of their own problems but it's chan <UNK> park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all
<START> this is one of my favorite mr <UNK> and i have seen them all as usual lorre is his charming self as the <UNK> mr <UNK> lionel <UNK> plays a delightfully zany museum <UNK> the usual comic relief is quite funny here and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye it's fast paced and fun br br the <UNK> doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas <UNK> the usual second lead in these <UNK> but he's adequate <UNK> <UNK> is on board and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny not <UNK> to his intelligence and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen
<START> no i've never seen any of the santa slasher series i e <UNK> night deadly night ' the original <UNK> <UNK> or this one <UNK> evil ' i've heard all about their reputation or <UNK> mothers against deranged <UNK> i thought i would rent this one as i've heard it pop up as a reference on a <UNK> guys at the <UNK> segment br br mothers should be against this but not for the <UNK> killer santa but for the fact this movie was just plain crap boring long  even at only <UNK> minutes crap br br little boy sees santa arrive down a <UNK> in <UNK> deliver presents eat some <UNK> and miraculously <UNK> up the <UNK> boy goes to bed but returns to living room to witness <UNK> and santa sort of getting it on apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life though the scene was about as steamy as when <UNK> dad got the leg <UNK> in 'a christmas story ' he was <UNK> disturbed he went to the attic and well cut his own hand br br fast forward to the future now it's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory we get a <UNK> of him being a little off <UNK> and he stalks both kids and parents alike who's naughty who's nice blah blah it takes a good two thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that's not <UNK> from frame one no movie should take that long br br i will admit this movie had its tension building but only because i kept expecting him to do something anything to anyone when he finally does well <UNK> who's naughty it's as graphic as a garbage <UNK> kid card and i haven't mentioned the wtf ending i'm thinking it was a metaphor but in reality it's just as weird as the rest of the movie take the brother who's upset his sibling is killing and his solution <UNK> killing don't open this mess even on christmas eve or evil again i didn't watch the other santa slashers but this one sucked bad it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present
<START> i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not for those that have not seen it see it without that annoying prime <UNK> floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott <UNK> was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the <UNK> babe is hot too check out the <UNK> scene i gave this a full 10 it blows away all the other series <UNK> i hope this goes longer than 7 years
<START> midnight cowboy is not for everybody it's raw painful and realistic but very entertaining the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances voight as the texas hustler joe buck who <UNK> from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy the new york city women like the rich lady played by <UNK> johnson and <UNK> played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women sadly buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas he was raised by his grandmother sally buck played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between <UNK> played by hoffman and <UNK> characters <UNK> into a moving male to male friendship the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job as the film <UNK> <UNK> past comes to the surface and it's haunting but not clear the film is not for children but compared to today's films and television programming midnight cowboy might be more tame i can't forget a young brenda <UNK> and a party that you can't forget it's also a <UNK> of a film so get your <UNK> out too
<START> <UNK> last production but not his least interesting film somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn't finish it himself and as the movie wasn't co signed by preminger who he did most of the staging a very strange mix of musical a <UNK> of the merry widow and classic lubitsch touch <UNK> an impossible love story like <UNK> brown yet a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings <UNK> on the <UNK> of mankind and especially men in times of war with a moral lesson still true today as it was in 1948 billy wilder as an answer to preminger who <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> about having lost a great man <UNK> that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that lady in <UNK>
<START> as other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography the colors are comic book bold i think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content despite its stellar cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre release press a good thing as her appearance here <UNK> some <UNK> to her album i'm breathless music inspired by the film dick tracy which was a <UNK> hit due in large part to the inclusion of dance hit <UNK> which is not in nor has the slightest relation to this film i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie ins to <UNK> i'm breathless album br br if you watch it at home by end titles you'll think there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back save yourself the wasted time do not bother with this
<START> yes <UNK> is a feel good movie a little romance great music beautiful scenery comedy a great food fight and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes <UNK> any movie buff would enjoy this film those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere most of us need a little escape now and then and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes ears and heart a must see
<START> i waited almost 25 years to see this movie thinking it might be an underrated work from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been it starred one of the best film villains of all time was based on a beloved series of children's books and was a disney studios production what could possibly be wrong with it as it turns outs almost everything br br well not everything vincent price as <UNK> and henry <UNK> <UNK> score are the movie's two saving <UNK> price is <UNK> enjoyable and <UNK> more professional than the material deserves they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity br br meanwhile the rest of the movie while filled with <UNK> adult situations still suffers from a completely dull script <UNK> generic voice work terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place on any of disney's mid 1980s saturday morning tv shows br br this was a complete disappointment to me it's amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> of this an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than <UNK> has in its endless running time br br the extra star that keeps this from being awful goes to price and <UNK>
<START> i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased when the show's run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes <UNK> but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
<START> well when the cameo appearance of jason miller looking even more <UNK> than he did in exorcist iv is the high point of a picture <UNK> you got br br it's a little bit country a little bit rock <UNK> roll mix two <UNK> with money who drag their kid all over the place with a <UNK> <UNK> mummy have you figured that one out yet <UNK> in a <UNK> in the basement christopher walken with a bad <UNK> job and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they'd developed her br br i understand sort of that they're going back to visit her relatives after that br br problem there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing i think this is never connected to anything br br problem what do we need the grandmother for now the grandmother could be interesting she speaks <UNK> or <UNK> or something maybe you can make something of her the best they can do is that she 's got a <UNK> habit that's all br br problem they cast a real <UNK> character as the husband is he type cast will he sell his wife to the devil maybe he can look forward to the trust <UNK> he manages for her or is he cast against type after all he has a good <UNK> and nice clothes he drinks he <UNK> he's not a bad guy not a good one but <UNK> why didn't they do something with him br br no problem an old boyfriend shows up the husband knocks him down he comes back to knock down the husband it gets pretty stupid but at least that character has motivation br br now she's an alcoholic he's an alcoholic he might only have married her for her money the grandmother is locked in the bedroom the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch are you following this who may come to life in fact you know she'll come to life the music <UNK> a little girl lives in the house takes tea to the grandmother <UNK> the door to do so and provides <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets out but nothing happens br br husband and wife lose the kid in the house subsequently lose their bedroom uncle gets his throat cut in the basement the leading lady has nose <UNK> the husband drinks they both drink in the face of all of this the awful truth <UNK> to in the first over voice is <UNK> an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old br br in spite of all these <UNK> thread ingredients nobody managed to get a story on the screen no bridge between situations no <UNK> from mild <UNK> to awful horror just long slow scenes that go nowhere <UNK> really to care about and they had places to go with that aspect the innocent kid in the charge of <UNK> the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster but no her worst fault is smoking she's got great hair good makeup br br in short no plot just a little random predictable violence in a dark library with the rain <UNK> in and the sound track <UNK> us in you need more than a few <UNK> and christopher walken to make a movie br br the production values were good oh nice scenery good wardrobe the cameraman at least knew what he was doing br br i bought it poor me
<START> i had low expectations for this movie but i was looking for something <UNK> for an evening i walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised this is a very fine baseball tribute film and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams dennis quaid does a masterful job with his role and i was touched by his performance definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time
<START> detective russell logan lou diamond phillips has a major problem on his hands the serial killer patrick <UNK> jeff <UNK> for whom psychic <UNK> tess tracy griffith helped him capture has been <UNK> with the first power given to him by satan after his execution in the gas chamber and can possess the bodies of the weak somehow russell who joins forces with tess who has an understanding of what they are up against will have to stop <UNK> or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands they will seek help from sister <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> who has tried to inform her superiors in the catholic church of the first power but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop <UNK> a cross with a blade that can <UNK> the heart of <UNK> <UNK> the world of his evil she'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to russell <UNK> need all the help he can get when <UNK> kidnaps tess preparing her for some sort of satanic ritual ceremony br br in the film <UNK> <UNK> always a reliable welcome supporting actor gets the partner of russell role so you know what will happen to him as in films of this type everyone around russell is dying but when he attempts to kill <UNK> he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses br br pure occult rubbish stupid from the gate to the finish line phillips and griffith try i'll give them that but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance <UNK> who is normally often always effective as the heavy is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and <UNK> rotten <UNK>
<START> how powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be this film tells it's tale with everyday scenes that manage to <UNK> the <UNK> hidden within it's true as others have stated how this film really makes it <UNK> obvious how lost hollywood is in it's special effects overblown <UNK> and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism so much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in <UNK> dialogue one aspect that i really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers one so very openly <UNK> in his <UNK> way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion the older brother needed to say little as he usually did it was all there in that deadpan face of his beautiful cinematography wonderful acting great direction not to be missed
<START> this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really really sucks i normally <UNK> stuff like this early 70's <UNK> flicks with <UNK> sounding titles and a <UNK> low budget atmosphere usually rock house of seven corpses appeared to <UNK> of even more <UNK> since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans including john carradine john ireland and faith <UNK> and the filming locations the titular house the graveyard are obviously very <UNK> for a gloomy tale of terror the film opens with its absolute greatest and most <UNK> memorable sequences though sadly enough they're the only ones that qualify as such the credits are a splendid montage complete with <UNK> color effects and eerie freeze frames <UNK> how the titular house received its notorious reputation the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage <UNK> <UNK> their final moments someone falls down the balcony screaming a lady <UNK> in her <UNK> and another female body hangs <UNK> from the ceiling and four more macabre <UNK> needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr price carradine only <UNK> this reputation in other words the house forms the ideal <UNK> for the acclaimed director eric <UNK> john ireland to shoot his satanic horror film project the film within film structure is what mainly causes house of seven corpses to be so boring and <UNK> a lot of movie material is wasted on crew members putting films <UNK> in the camera and dragging around <UNK> or  even worse  faith <UNK> and charles <UNK> portraying <UNK> <UNK> actor stereotypes the plot finally gets a little interesting only a little mind you when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally <UNK> a rotting corpse in the backyard the <UNK> judging by the noises he produces zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses after a running time of approximately 60 minutes the film suddenly turns from <UNK> into just plain weird and confusing i'm still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go <UNK> vast mental <UNK> shortly before they die for some reason i honestly regret <UNK> house of seven corpses is a pretty dreadful movie the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling but not nearly used to full effect and there's a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed numerous low budgeted 70's gems were stunningly gross so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film within film murders really don't count even the always reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and <UNK> direction is completely uninspired not recommended unless you think the zero cool four and a half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of <UNK> a copy
<START> my what a director's <UNK> can bring on material that needs just the right <UNK> in the right directions young mr lincoln is filled up with some <UNK> <UNK> values which in retrospect despite its two dimensional portrayal is at least more <UNK> done than one might see in the <UNK> in current cinema what makes it work so extremely well as it does in all its simplicity and <UNK> is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the <UNK> of a history lesson br br we all know of abraham lincoln as the <UNK> president that did the <UNK> and after the civil war got <UNK> but as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic funny in the most unexpected places and a true gentleman he's not some superhero that can do no wrong which was <UNK> only <UNK> to the part before <UNK> on but a figure with possible flaws that are <UNK> by his <UNK> goodness and clear sight of right and wrong br br it's suffice to say that john ford is exceptional as a <UNK> almost without trying actually it's a lie he does try but he makes it sort of <UNK> in the studio system he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously <UNK> so he was pretty much left alone to his own <UNK> practices in editing in camera and not moving it around so as to not <UNK> far off from the story it's this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material as a kind of companion piece to the full blooded <UNK> in 1939 as seen in mr smith goes to washington only here it's the law and not politics br br fonda is terrific in the lead his first with ford and never lets us loose sight of lincoln past the make up and extra boost in the shoes <UNK> own personality in a sense as it would in <UNK> of wrath and my darling <UNK> comes out in the character of lincoln however unlikely it might be there's no one else from this period that could have played him then he's mature and wise but has the <UNK> to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he saw that but did she murder case br br only in little bits and pieces like that final shot which <UNK> lincoln walking down the road with his <UNK> and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on seem pretty dated as far as the goals set out with young mr lincoln there were all met by ford and his crew and cast it's not as hokey as one might think going in and it's got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos
<START> yet another son who won't grow up flick and just the other recent like entries <UNK> in another bad wig <UNK> <UNK> for what the third time anna <UNK> is forgettable as always jeff daniels <UNK> this one in from another state at least and diane keaton how does one become <UNK> this late in a career do not bother nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over i will say this it's about a hundred times better than failure to launch there are very few amusing bits in the movie unless you think eli <UNK> <UNK> is funny ha ha he's old and he dropped the f bomb <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pitiful
<START> jim carrey rocks if he's in a movie its bound to be good he did not disappoint me with this one the rest of the cast was cute especially little cindy lou who and martha may i was laughing through the whole thing and cannot wait to see it again
<START> imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's <UNK> and you're finished with the <UNK> you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain it's sold out <UNK> the bank job in <UNK> the <UNK> or prom night you've seen the bank job <UNK> decent heist movie that and in <UNK> again pretty good so you're down to two you don't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the 8 50 walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for 8 50 it would be money better spent br br it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was <UNK> that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyone's intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots or maybe dogs in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen ben affleck and hayden <UNK> i hate his acting so much i don't care how you spell his name you are <UNK> on your title s br br so in summary <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed the main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back why because of bad script although dillon lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie just like for <UNK> of beautiful diane lane legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him far below his level so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary the only thing that you'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes rest of it is very forgettable
<START> this movie was such a blast it has that feel good yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie it has a good message party girl decides she needs a real job yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor but is also a <UNK>
<START> the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say <UNK> takes dutch <UNK> but she is speaking german to him the 2 <UNK> are completely different its like saying well he takes french <UNK> and start talking spanish br br james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesn't fit him even if its <UNK> to be a comedy br br to many stereotype <UNK> stuff typical comment or <UNK> br br if you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldn't suggesting renting it
<START> if you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the hollywood scene made it to where they are the vast majority will tell you assuming they will tell that a strange coincidence took place they happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects <UNK> <UNK> took an acting class whose <UNK> knew harvey keitel kevin spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role and robin williams credits his career to gary <UNK> son who after having seen star wars suggested to his father that an alien should visit the <UNK> of happy days these <UNK> many times viewed as pure luck <UNK> many of the careers in hollywood today or is it pure luck is possible something else is going on grand canyon written and directed by lawrence <UNK> <UNK> an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable aka the strange <UNK> coincidence the movie concerns several different characters whose lives <UNK> because of positive and yet inexplicable <UNK> br br kevin kline a middle aged father experiences a break down in one of the more dangerous areas of la after he phones a <UNK> truck a young gang <UNK> him they <UNK> violence if he doesn't leave his car just before the confrontation can <UNK> danny glover appears as the <UNK> truck driver and <UNK> the intentions of the gang although glover <UNK> it later he probably saved <UNK> life a producer steve martin of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after <UNK> has a spiritual experience he then <UNK> retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment and <UNK> wife <UNK> mary <UNK> while on a morning <UNK> finds a baby hidden in some <UNK> she claims the baby cried for her and that her rescue of the <UNK> was <UNK> br br the movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships end to relationships and new <UNK> and all the while a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on br br it is very rare in hollywood or for film in general to explore such a purely <UNK> subject there are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable but maybe that's the point what makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast although the <UNK> and <UNK> may seem far fetched the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities maybe this is a subject we should explore more often
<START> i started watching the apprentice about 4 years ago maybe 5 and i really really liked it the first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format which though similar to a lot of other reality shows at its core is still very entertaining donald <UNK> is wonderful as the host and the main judge of the show as well the casting coup with intelligent people having good looks being picked as contestants is appreciated as well but the best part of the show is new york city mark <UNK> may have made a lot of crap in his time but his handling of the cinematography is excellent as he makes nyc look like a character <UNK> itself the jazz tunes coupled with some great camera work make new york look spectacular br br the apprentice will easily <UNK> make my top 3 reality shows of all time the amazing race is no 1 however but just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in <UNK> if you keep watching it for a while the originality of the show will wear off fast the same case as with <UNK> star world the <UNK> in this country did a bang up job in presenting the show the first three seasons were shown in a row then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown which kept the concept fresh br br in conclusion you will love this show especially the first 2 seasons however if you keep watching the show continuously thereafter its charm will wear off and fast
<START> presenting lily mars mgm 1943 is a cute film but in my opinion it could have been better judy garland is great as always but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and van <UNK> develops all too quickly br br i mean one minute he's ready to beat her butt but the next minute he falls in love with her i believe that this production the film editing and the script even though the photography was great the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well could have been a little better it feels as though the production was too rushed br br the supporting cast was good as well especially little janet <UNK> as the second youngest daughter daughter <UNK> she at the age of 11 looks really cute and it's a shame that she didn't develop into a teenage comic actress she's much better in this film than in her previous films as warner brothers in the late 1930's except for broadway <UNK> 1938 she's really good in that when they tried to make her into a shirley temple <UNK> jason hybrid overall this film could better but in the end judy gave it her all
<START> excellent film <UNK> <UNK> will hold your interest throughout has not been shown on american tv for a decade one scene that has always stayed with me is the german <UNK> gas attack you will find others hope they soon put it on tape
<START> it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of <UNK> where a very high <UNK> of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person not even as an extra that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general however br br no spoilers only a brief <UNK> description br br buddy portrays four young people living in a flat share in <UNK> the protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion and one might say that the film could be about being <UNK> and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the cliché although the story is mildly funny the acting is good and as a <UNK> <UNK> one can sort of identify with the characters <UNK> situations and complicated love affairs i don't find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as <UNK> yes that show on tv br br has norwegian film finally found its identity audience <UNK> in well known american style br br how about watching lukas <UNK> <UNK> together
<START> angels in the <UNK> was originally a 1951 movie from the ted turner library disney remade it in 1994 this time using the california angels now the los angeles angels as the team disney used to own this and the <UNK> mighty <UNK> hockey team also good use of the words huh br br this movie was about a couple of <UNK> children who wanted a family a man promised the boys a family only if the angels won the <UNK> so he called upon god one night about this the boy who <UNK> could see the help coming on the way and only that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball for much of the post all star season of 1994 the angels were at the top of the al west of which my home team the rangers is one and it still is however they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the white sox angels game there was no central division in baseball back then hence chicago being in the west and no angels were there to help thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games but wait in the final championship game the angels won it was a miracle indeed br br what i liked about this film this is a good movie i mean i <UNK> every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now my work was good so for one this shows that if you believe god can send his angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life and second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting this is an old disney movie too i've seen this just recently on the new disney channel <UNK> br br angels in the <UNK> will change your life forever once you've seen it br br 10 10
<START> the british production company <UNK> is generally known as the <UNK> for horror <UNK> and this great <UNK> called the house that <UNK> blood is <UNK> the finest <UNK> production i've seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that <UNK> blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as <UNK> elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that <UNK> blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different <UNK> br br the first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles <UNK> <UNK> elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great <UNK> to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are <UNK> very good br br in the second story <UNK> retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second best of the film after the third br br the third tale <UNK> to the sweet is by far the <UNK> and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and <UNK> mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to <UNK> his daughter is appalled about her <UNK> <UNK> towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the <UNK> father's views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role <UNK> dawn porter is also very good as the <UNK> and my special praise goes to then 11 year old chloe <UNK> this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must see for every true horror fan br br in the fourth segment horror actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistress co star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many <UNK> to other horror films at one point henderson <UNK> refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segment br br all four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the <UNK> and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often <UNK> humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an <UNK> atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine <UNK> and a brilliant cast make this one a must see in short the house that <UNK> blood is an excellent horror <UNK> that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended
<START> in a summer that also <UNK> such <UNK> <UNK> as snakes on a plane and the da <UNK> code that's a pretty bold statement but i stand by it nonetheless superman returns like king kong 6 months before it is overlong hyper indulgent and with cgi up to the <UNK> my god this stuff is doing my head in br br richard <UNK> had the idea of <UNK> it <UNK> for his 2 <UNK> and i do find his approach to the special and <UNK> effects to be the most appropriate brian singer <UNK> us with so much cgi that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend 250 million a totally irresponsible amount of money on obnoxious visual effects that don't live up to the hype we've seen everything and been everywhere that cgi can take us there's no real atmosphere or involvement in this and for a film that is 95 made up of this crap well you figure it out br br i've read so many reviews from <UNK> critics about how the movie has <UNK> or 'a human <UNK> or <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> we've already had brooding <UNK> <UNK> screaming <UNK> love me if you knew who i <UNK> dozens of times already in recent years and sr offers absolutely nothing new in this regard even the plot is recycled garbage lex luthor a seriously <UNK> cast and hammy kevin spacey plotting to destroy the <UNK> of america was done in the first film already and well that's your lot it's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2 5 painful hours even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable but brandon <UNK> has the on screen personality of a <UNK> hat stand kate <UNK> is completely unconvincing as a <UNK> prize winning journalist james <UNK> is 250 wooden as usual and kevin spacey really needs to either fire his agent or <UNK> some better judgement the only cast member i liked was the lovely parker posey but i'm into weird looking girls br br every year films like this get bigger and more <UNK> pretty soon we'll have 300 million films studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up for all the money that warner spent on this pile of crap for all the resources that this movie cost to make was it worth it in my opinion certainly not this garbage has put me of superman for life
<START> today i visited an <UNK> cinema with my two kids 6 8 years old <UNK> 3 x 12 <UNK> about 45 us total not to mention gas popcorn <UNK> was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last 20 years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in <UNK> name br br ps 1 the average working greek makes no more than <UNK> <UNK> a month <UNK> <UNK> us br br ps 2 my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies in greek <UNK> morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this 3d disgrace happen br br ps 3 3d animation is fantastic but who gives a
<START> in 1933 dick powell and ruby keeler sang and <UNK> their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a <UNK> distraction from their <UNK> gold <UNK> of 1933 <UNK> street and <UNK> parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the <UNK> choreography of busby berkeley show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players br br all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear <UNK> for <UNK> due to it's pace energy and lead james cagney warren william in gold <UNK> and warner <UNK> in <UNK> street <UNK> themselves admirably as the shows production heads particularly <UNK> as the burned out julian <UNK> in search of one last box office smash both lack the <UNK> energy of cagney however who perfectly <UNK> the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical he is an absolute <UNK> as he deals with production numbers <UNK> partners and a gold digging girlfriend br br of course cagney alone does not make <UNK> the classic that it is the script <UNK> with some sharp double <UNK> delivered by a <UNK> supporting cast featuring frank <UNK> hugh herbert guy <UNK> and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size busby <UNK> dance numbers are surreal suggestive and <UNK> and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in <UNK> sadly the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> again <UNK> and morality made sure of it
<START> excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary <UNK> touching and profound one of the best <UNK> films ever made captures <UNK> the everyday life in a central <UNK> small town people's desires and weaknesses <UNK> and <UNK> the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this <UNK> examination of people in a <UNK> society <UNK> is indeed one of the most promising <UNK> filmmakers he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed his next film <UNK> is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> oh dear good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but i'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good sorry
<START> well no not really its not really a good movie but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be i really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for the plot is ok nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty the directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem there was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasn't all that hot all in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film i've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan check it out sometime i'd even watch it again br br bonus fact for horror <UNK> kane <UNK> jason <UNK> in a few of them plays the werewolf
<START> the infamous ed wood classic plan 9 from outer space features an <UNK> alien calling the human race stupid stupid stupid stupid i'd have to say exhibit a in that trial would probably this movie a ridiculously silly sci fi film br br falling action star jean claude van damme returns to a hit role for him from the original movie luke a former universal soldier who now works making really good universal soldiers while van damme was too big to <UNK> the role in the first two sequels he was too small to do much of anything else by the time the fourth film in the universal soldier series came around so probably <UNK> under his breath the whole way he kicks and <UNK> and <UNK> through ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks you'll find plenty of mindless violence but i'd advise you get a coat check for your brain at the door when you start watching this thing otherwise you are <UNK> to forget where you left it by the time it's over br br luke is called into action against more universal soldiers after a really really really evil computer named seth makes hal look like <UNK> turns all the other universal soldiers into evil <UNK> killers of course this is what these things are <UNK> to do but in this case they are killing their creators not the enemy so that's a problem br br i love the dumb logic of this movie logic that believes that a <UNK> would create a body for itself that looks as ashamed as michael <UNK> white does to be in this movie logic that <UNK> that the creator of seth be a blue haired <UNK> stereotype geek who <UNK> cliches more regularly than old faithful does steam logic that has a climactic karate fight feature two characters kicking each other though ten separate <UNK> of shattering glass in the span of three minutes of screen time br br the film also features a daughter in peril character wrestler bill goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a universal soldier and a romance so tacked on i have to think the writers thought tacked on romances were actually a good thing and when this movie ends it ends not a minute after a gigantic <UNK> finale style explosion are the credits running no <UNK> no where are they now no final kiss just explosion hug over even the creators want to get out of this thing as soon as possible br br while it's no plan 9 us <UNK> is a silly little <UNK> of an action movie that would be fun at parties full of <UNK> van damme fans who enjoy seeing their hero really reaching new depths not to be seen on a serious stomach

<START> this movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending it's still well worth seeing the film begins as <UNK> <UNK> is about to marry robert ryan when the minister asks if anyone has any <UNK> a guy jumps up and <UNK> that <UNK> can't get married because she already is married <UNK> insists this isn't true but when they investigate they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license slowly it becomes apparent that <UNK> mind is <UNK> and people around her seriously doubt her sanity then when the supposed first husband is murdered all evidence and suspicion falls on <UNK> br br the film is an exciting mystery suspense film as what i have so far described is only the first half of the movie what follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating unfortunately the conclusion though is a bit of a let down as the <UNK> force behind all this turns out to come right out of left field and is <UNK> since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer however in spite of this the film was so good i can even excuse the limp ending in particular robert ryan did a great job as the <UNK> <UNK> fiancé though apart from him the other performances were also excellent
<START> i thought the kids in the movie were great i deal with kids in that age group and i thought their <UNK> were very believable i did have a problem with the reference to the private parts made by the 5 year old i didn't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly <UNK> my opinion of the movie br br i think luke <UNK> is up and coming star i would like to see more of him on the big screen i enjoyed his reactions to the situations that he found himself in often kids in this age group do things without thinking through the consequences almost all of the actors did this throughout the movie br br i also think the message of bullying needs to be examined more in movies with this age group it is a major problem in schools today br br the ending was quite unexpected <UNK> thoughts on whether he won or didn't win the bet were very surprising how he handled that situation was excellent too often today kids are not willing to compromise the actors in this movie showed that compromise is an important part of life
<START> when samantha <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> answers the door of her house <UNK> in a <UNK> you realize that as competent an actress as <UNK> may be she doesn't have the hypnotic <UNK> of barbara stanwyck and it is not entirely <UNK> fault in the original film wilder had stanwyck not only appear in a <UNK> but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house and she doesn't come out she appears almost as if by magic walter <UNK> is staring up at her from below on the first floor there is a reason for this stanwyck is much higher than <UNK> fred macmurray when they are first introduced it is not just the <UNK> the <UNK> adds to the seductive <UNK> her pose is like a greek <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation she has sexual even magic power this person is no ordinary housewife this person is a mystery with secrets hidden within br br back to 1973 the remake has crenna knock on the front door <UNK> stand in <UNK> answers the door with a <UNK> around her there is no appearance she simply opens the door the <UNK> <UNK> that grabs the audience at the first appearance of stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 she opens the door with a <UNK> around her it may be sexy in a charlie's angels sort of way but it's not nearly as mysterious the filmmakers of the remake seem to <UNK> <UNK> point the script may have said <UNK> appears in <UNK> so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the <UNK> and include the required <UNK> the point is not the <UNK> the point is the enigmatic quality of <UNK> and the potential power she <UNK> wilder gave her a <UNK> to add to her <UNK> the filmmakers of the remake gave her a <UNK> because that's what wilder did and in the choice of shot lost all of <UNK> <UNK> br br richard crenna also seems miscast he seems like he's acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma part of the problem is crenna appears so much like a 70's actor he can't get into the 1940's when macmurray first speaks into the <UNK> sweat begins to <UNK> from his face no sweat on crenna and they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning in the original <UNK> says i didn't get the money and i didn't get the woman in the 1973 version crenna says i didn't get the money and i didn't want the woman did the filmmakers completely <UNK> the entire point of the story or were they <UNK> it down for a television audience br br this made for tv movie is a by the numbers rendition all the sharp edge of the original is lost the only stand out maybe is lee j <UNK> in the role made famous by edward g robinson but he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original this 1973 boring remake is a forgettable tv movie made probably by the same people who did <UNK> island they might as well have tried to remake citizen kane or gone with the wind if mediocrity is the best one can hope for what's the point the 1944 classic is a film with a capital f this made for tv remake deserves an f grade or maybe a d for dumb
<START> this show seemed to be kinda good <UNK> <UNK> is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong br br first of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but <UNK> mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way as stated above i hate it br br all in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed
<START> the plot of corpse <UNK> 2 is very much similar to the original corpse <UNK> what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens br br it is my belief that this film would be the 1 worst film on imdb if anyone had actually watched it the plot is <UNK> and in several way too many instances makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an <UNK> and horrendous but still somewhat better film br br i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh
<START> jamie foxx is my favorite comedian however i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker martin lawrence and dave <UNK> who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept see money talks blue streak br br okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in <UNK> to a dream or in living <UNK> tommy <UNK> and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee's satire <UNK>
<START> this video nasty was initially banned in britain and allowed in last november without cuts br br it features the playboy <UNK> of the month october 1979 ursula <UNK> the opening cuts back and forth between <UNK> and <UNK> jungle pictures i am not sure what the purpose of that was it would have been much better to focus on the <UNK> scene br br laura <UNK> is kidnapped and held in the jungle for <UNK> peter al <UNK> the beyond zombie is sent to find her and the <UNK> of course one of the <UNK> antonio de <UNK> manages to pass the time <UNK> while another <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the <UNK> exchange goes to hell and laura runs into the jungle will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal oh yes there are cannibals in this jungle why do you think it was a video nasty muriel <UNK> is found by peter and his partner antonio <UNK> angel of death on the <UNK> boat <UNK> is very <UNK> <UNK> peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura who has been captured by now they pass the time having sex and don't see the danger approaching guts anyone great fight between peter and the naked devil burt altman br br blood <UNK> guts lots of full frontal some great <UNK> by the cannibal <UNK> <UNK> mess and the line they <UNK> her heart out which is hilarious if you see the film
<START> in a way this film reminded me of jumping jack flash remember whoopi goldberg at the <UNK> machine whoopi <UNK> out <UNK> whoopi as blind <UNK> and imitating mick jagger great moments captured on film for sure but the movie still kind of sucks right that's how i feel about rich in love a man hears his wife sing for the first time post <UNK> teenagers talk about the nature of love albert finney eats ice cream out of bucket and in another scene has a lovely waking moment regarding his absent wife <UNK> <UNK> adds another colorful character to her acting wardrobe but there's only the <UNK> of a plot here and you can't wait for it to get moving only when ex go <UNK> charlotte <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> up a great pop song does the picture wake up and then it's over br br this picture is the equivalent of a lazy <UNK> day in the deep american south
<START> however i am not one of them <UNK> <UNK> at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and self <UNK> third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self indulgent mess <UNK> says he feels a need to make this movie but doesn't want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesn't want to either a film about italian politics and <UNK> could be fascinating but this is not that film at one point <UNK> and his friends are standing outside the communist party <UNK> discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with party leaders inside but it's characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them <UNK> with <UNK> political <UNK> are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the <UNK> <UNK> the film drags us through several years and more than one election period we keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or <UNK> argument but they never come i for one doubt that i could have the patience to ever sit through a <UNK> <UNK> movie again he succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity
<START> now i haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here so i'm not going to go down that path here br br but i have some time ago <UNK> that stephen king movies simply are not horror films with perhaps a couple of exceptions this was not one of them it started well enough and for once i'm not going to complain about the acting although fred <UNK> was as usual wonderful also i will forgive the total lack of <UNK> skills as they were necessary to make the story here move forward br br but there was one consistent point that i couldn't help but get annoyed with and that came pretty close to the end of the movie and at least 2 characters <UNK> in the activity of dumb stupidity the moments i refer to are thus there is a tiny zombie running around the house you suspect it is under the bed do you br br a get as close to the bed as you can before <UNK> raising the <UNK> cover up exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a <UNK> undead cannibal might <UNK> on you or br br b move a little away from the bed so you can <UNK> under the completely open end from a position of slightly <UNK> safety or at least see the mini terror coming at you giving you a little reaction time br br i know let's go with a i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today <UNK> br br fun enough film though just not very scary
<START> the bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil the love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction two brothers andy and hank will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most br br andy <UNK> philip seymour hoffman and his younger brother hank ethan hawke couldn't be more different andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in new <UNK> real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife gina marisa tomei who is the idea of a <UNK> wife if one ever existed hank however is <UNK> who finds himself at the mercy of his ex wife his daughter's expensive school bills and endless amount of child support <UNK> a man who means well and has good intentions hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he <UNK> to stay above it br br however andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better he has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears the pressure of his life and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with gina in order to start over again of course like hank he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it how by robbing the <UNK> store that their parents own and run this act of betrayal is where the <UNK> brothers their families and several other lives will be destroyed because of greed pride and fear br br the <UNK> of before the devil knows you're dead is the manner in which the story is told after the robbery goes wrong and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> harris who is the mother of both andy and hank is killed the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt we learn more about the motivations of not only andy and hank but also the reaction to their father charles albert finney to the death of his wife the relationship between charles and his two sons especially to andy is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men <UNK> may have been <UNK> loved by her sons but their father is a different story br br philip seymour hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in hollywood today by portraying andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also in <UNK> way as a man we can sympathize with ethan hawke also brings hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left andy and hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions br br before the devil knows you're dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face more than that our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected in what should have been best picture of the year we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives in other words there are no easy <UNK> or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse br br 10 10
<START> oh man it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science well i guess this <UNK> nonsense is now replacing the science of <UNK> al gore tries to make this issue sound complicated even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big <UNK> by a man with his own <UNK> agenda br br how have scientists <UNK> historical <UNK> of this planet by <UNK> the sun spot activity has nobody ever <UNK> if this method has been accurate no not even gore himself so how the heck would it not be accurate to <UNK> future <UNK> with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past according to sun spot activity the <UNK> today is totally in line with what it should be how come the <UNK> in the entire universe has <UNK> relatively equal much as on earth does our <UNK> cause <UNK> on <UNK> to rise br br use some common sense you do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a <UNK> please research it yourself what does al gore and his <UNK> friends like <UNK> <UNK> family that arranged live earth event to gain from this well the new world bank will be <UNK> on <UNK> credits that is tax on everything that gives <UNK> <UNK> and it is easier to get away with these <UNK> if the people are <UNK> to think it is to save the world when it is only about money <UNK> control and more power to the <UNK> <UNK> al gore has even a company that sells <UNK> credits is it not noble to pay <UNK> <UNK> credits to save the world especially if it goes into his own company br br i do not want you to <UNK> believe me please do your own research and use your own common sense and i am sure you will come to the right conclusion
<START> i watch lots of bad films lots it's kind of a <UNK> really almost every saturday <UNK> a group of friends and i get together and watch trash from around the globe anything turkish super hero movies vampire flicks from brazil italian gorilla transplant movies kevin <UNK> films anything except maybe raising helen but <UNK> never seen a worst film than theodore rex never and it's not even <UNK> bad in an ed wood kinda way it just sucks now this film was famous in hollywood at the time it was made because whoopi took off the <UNK> and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of crap she tried to get out of her contract she <UNK> she <UNK> but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see <UNK> and you can just see her <UNK> during takes doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him the dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible a third grade class could do a better job if promised <UNK>
<START> this is a good adaptation of <UNK> novel good but not brilliant br br the cinematography is inventive crossing at times the border to <UNK> but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes given that the entire story is dialogue driven br br the acting is competent ms paltrow is <UNK> as her character requires but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate <UNK> from her own actions in other words she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match making <UNK> some of the supporting cast is guilty of over acting very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures personally i had problems accepting alan <UNK> as mr <UNK> to no fault of his own except for having left such an impression as a gay <UNK> <UNK> in the high life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part acting <UNK> go to toni collette who manages to <UNK> warmth and jeremy northam who <UNK> his character at just the right level
<START> inspector gadget was probably my all time favorite 80's cartoon i enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as <UNK> christmas special inspector gadget saves christmas some gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season 1985 of the show but they need to compare it to <UNK> 2002 release of inspector <UNK> last case <UNK> revenge for then they will find the second season to be absolute gold br br being a gadget fan i couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated inspector gadget in something that wasn't gadget boy related i purchased the film and i <UNK> to myself that i'd be objective i knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series i was not even prepared for what i was about to watch br br there was barely a shred of the original show still intact br br here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie the humor is non existent from the original series br br penny and brain originally having a nearly equal part in the series as gadget are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute <UNK> br br the original music by <UNK> levy is not there and the score that exists is sub par understood that <UNK> has his own production company now but at least inspector gadget saves christmas had good music even without <UNK> don't expect to see any of <UNK> <UNK> which made the show so endearing such as gadget <UNK> gadget <UNK> gadget <UNK> gadget coat which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing as well as his standard other hat and hand <UNK> in this movie his gadget legs were <UNK> instead of springs that kind of stuff <UNK> true fans of the show and simply aren't necessary to change br br the <UNK> from the original series is now a fast talking supposedly hip <UNK> all the fans from the original series enjoyed the <UNK> <UNK> into the gadget van and vice versa br br chief <UNK> is now very short <UNK> and even mean to gadget he was always grumpy in the original series but this pushes the situation a bit much br br penny no longer has a computer book br br are there any <UNK> to this movie ok here goes br br maurice <UNK> does a good job of taking over for the great don adams as inspector gadget br br in one scene chief <UNK> <UNK> to an actual villain from the cartoon series the great <UNK> classic gadget villain from the second season voiced by louis <UNK> br br looking for more redeeming factors for this movie well you're out of luck life is about making choices and living by those choices most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson the lesson learned here keep to the original formula if it ain't broke don't fix it true gadget fans should steer clear from this movie you will surely be disappointed br br hopefully <UNK> and shout factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of inspector gadget the original series volume 1 containing the first 22 episodes of the series as a true gadget fan lover of 80's animation and many of <UNK> programs i urge you the viewer to purchase inspector gadget the original series volume 1 and inspector gadget saves christmas dvd's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories
<START> i just didn't get this movie was it a musical no but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it br br was it a serious drama no the acting was not good enough for that br br is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor <UNK> not br br i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student <UNK> is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse br br see for yourself but in fairness i hated it
<START> first of all let's start out by saying that robert englund doug <UNK> and melinda clark should be <UNK> for having to be associated with this piece of drivel i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero wanna know how bad this movie is my mom calls me from across town and tells me son i just watched the stupidest movie ever i <UNK> as saying the killer tongue huh she was like how did you know that that's how bad this movie is i mean it looked like a good movie at first freddy <UNK> melinda okay i'll give it a chance i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a <UNK> for reviews of horror movies i <UNK> you don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap run away far away if you see it on the shelf at hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store turn it around and walk away and i still want my two hours back <UNK> it

<START> i rented the film i don't think it got a theatrical release here out expecting the worse the previews made the film look awful i was in fact very surprised it was well worth watching it was loosely scripted almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too <UNK> it is flawed mainly by the awful soundtrack of <UNK> <UNK> effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an <UNK> or larry sanders way br br at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would be <UNK> 'the worst film ever <UNK> i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film
<START> this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the <UNK> behavior of some disgusting woman in an <UNK> manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all give us a break here's my question to the filmmakers if <UNK> were a man and <UNK> were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture <UNK> and <UNK> with this person answer hell no br br imagine switching the <UNK> in this film and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage were the <UNK> switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man <UNK> upon a young girl his <UNK> behavior landing him in prison and his <UNK> victim suffering from <UNK> syndrome the only reason <UNK> does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex br br let's call a spade a spade <UNK> is a <UNK> plain and simple no <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> she's a criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our <UNK> and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy

<START> what happened <UNK> had so much potential to be a brilliant film but instead it <UNK> with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching the only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of meryl streep who no doubt deserved the oscar nomination though it was not one of her best performances she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which <UNK> through the screen br br however not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill from the boring start which had no power or punch to the less than convincing ending the film was truly a disappointment especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers it was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film which dragged on for too long with too much talk and not enough action br br furthermore the other oscar nominations were less than convincing though philip seymour hoffman gave a decent performance it was by no means oscar worthy especially since they completely left out performances such as will smith in seven pounds amy adams did not deserve the nomination watching amy adams was like watching a cardboard box as it was one sided and plain it would have made more sense to <UNK> her for a <UNK> as i am sure she would have walked away <UNK> <UNK> davis gave a short but truthful performance but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination br br overall i consider doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008 it was a mess of a film with so much potential and i do not recommend it the only shining light in the film is meryl streep who though gives a stunning solid performance doesn't even do enough to save this film 10
<START> anna ursula <UNK> is brought in as an official r n by ex lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> del <UNK> ostensibly to nurse an aging widower count <UNK> <UNK> mario <UNK> back to health after a heart attack but <UNK> is actually leading a group of <UNK> and <UNK> including american <UNK> mr <UNK> jack palance with <UNK> motives reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count he has a history of well liking women and would be actually a bit more vulnerable as he is <UNK> the bad guys get <UNK> as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count the ending might be said to be ironic but it is probably better described as predictable br br but so much for plot this film is totally an erotic comedy from start to finish and oh how good there are many nude scenes including ones of anna and <UNK> one of the <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> both ursula and <UNK> are noteworthy <UNK> ex bond women and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers as she did in <UNK> remember <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a femme fatale sort of although less <UNK> br br perhaps the best scene is <UNK> slow complete strip and jump in bed with the young <UNK> the other patient who incredibly is <UNK> in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot but even at this point she is already two faced for the better for she has decided not to go along however <UNK> is more than a two <UNK> with women having had lengthy <UNK> in the past with both anna and <UNK> and the rival best erotic scene follows an <UNK> filled to put it mildly argument between him and <UNK> this is a standing up encounter in which <UNK> is down to black <UNK> only another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the <UNK> pool the count is free as the client to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula and he takes advantage hey somehow i've gone back to the <UNK> names in my <UNK> erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine <UNK> chase the <UNK> nurse is <UNK> <UNK> minutes but it doesn't need to be it is enjoyable without <UNK> start to finish definitely recommended br br

<START> it's very hard to say just what was going on with the lady from shanghai and what the film could have been without studio <UNK> orson welles' prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater indeed funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs he made lady from shanghai for his soon to be ex wife rita hayworth harry <UNK> was <UNK> for <UNK> image and held back the release of this movie for one year br br the plot concerns an irish sailor michael o'hara who falls in love with else hayworth stunning with short blond hair her husband is a well known criminal attorney arthur <UNK> everett sloane who is as crippled on the inside as he is out he hires o'hara to work on his <UNK> and there o'hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and <UNK> br br the lady from shanghai moves at a <UNK> pace though i agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot still this movie drags the scene in the fun house is fantastic welles wanted it without music though and i believe the studio cut it down it's a shame the photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish br br welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and <UNK> a magnificent voice and technique but in many films it's almost as if he doesn't trust himself or doesn't take the time to develop a character instead he relies on <UNK> such as accents and fake <UNK> one of the only times he didn't do this was tomorrow is forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him contrast that with <UNK> where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance here welles is doing <UNK> duty as director star co writer and narrator sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization nevertheless he is always compelling br br the supporting players are excellent including <UNK> and glenn <UNK> hayworth gorgeous and soft voiced her singing was again dubbed by anita <UNK> is as usual a complete <UNK> and one of the great screen <UNK> what a sad life for such a vibrant beauty br br any film that orson welles directed is worth seeing and the lady from shanghai is no exception but this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does the magnificent <UNK> as does any work that welles did within the studio system he was a great artist who should have been given a <UNK> reign he wasn't he was a strange <UNK> he needed more freedom but as is <UNK> by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio alas he couldn't have both
<START> the definition of an abomination as defined by <UNK> <UNK> is a cause of <UNK> or disgust if someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for alone in the dark please let me know because this is the best i can come up with however i do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is br br i went to see this film with two of my roommates one has very similar tastes to me the other is an action adventure flick guru this latter guy usually doesn't care about the size of the plot holes as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied br br that being said we entered the theater for the friday viewing of alone in the dark little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater when it started i knew why immediately br br it begins with the worst opening scene of any movie and unfortunately i have to admit it only gets worse from there the opening scene is a 5 minute <UNK> text that is narrated yet i understand why it was narrated the director must have understood that only illiterate people would even <UNK> the thought of paying to see this movie yet not only is this first scene the longest <UNK> text in the history of cinema but it also makes no sense it seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies one is about an ancient civilization and its <UNK> with a <UNK> the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on <UNK> if you are reading this and are confused you are not alone br br then the awful storyline acting effects and camera work begin tara reid is horrendous as an actress she does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum <UNK> slater is just bad not convincing and has no chemistry with reid br br the plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man the entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like what is this and what is going on other than this <UNK> garbage we have a few narrated sequences by slater himself are they good no do they explain anything no do we at any point as an audience have the slightest <UNK> as to why we should care what happens once again no br br then we have a random sex scene we are told that slater and reid are together yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another but then <UNK> sex scene once again i don't know br br a good oh i don't know 30 seconds after that <UNK> scene ends we have a <UNK> with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things this is set to a heavy metal track and causes more brain <UNK> than one ever thought possible br br and if that wasn't enough br br there exists no main villain there is the scientist and there are the alien things at one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military <UNK> why how did he become the supreme commander of these things why do they listen to him once again i have no idea br br the movie ends with slater and reid walking in an <UNK> city why was the city <UNK> did the alien things break through did the military tell them who knows and by this point who cares i didn't and you won't br br but to top it off slater and reid are attacked by an alien thing even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to <UNK> and thats right you guessed it it the middle of the ing day and it's bright as can be maybe the alien thing bought a pair of <UNK> i don't know and i don't care br br now after the movie ended i ran outside the theater all 6 foot 6 <UNK> of me waving my arms and shaking my <UNK> telling everyone not to go see this movie even my <UNK> ho action adventure roommate who would consider a movie that just cut and <UNK> 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film br br to sum up this crap fest i give it a 0 0 10 and would give it lower if i could br br <UNK> the worst movie ever made i wouldn't wish this movie on my worst enemy
<START> truly amazing film the concept as a possible <UNK> vision of the future is frightening a world vastly <UNK> unbearable heat due to the damaged <UNK> <UNK> and all our natural resources spent in this nightmarish <UNK> society we have the great charlton heston as a likable film <UNK> style detective trying to <UNK> the truth behind a murder opposite the film noir legend edward g robinson turning in a fine last performance br br one of the images that will always stay with me from this film is the masses of people that <UNK> the <UNK> and the way in which <UNK> heston has to hop through them every time he uses them br br the movie's use of music is note worthy too although it contains no score in the usual sense the opening theme is good and the subsequent <UNK> of music we here in <UNK> apartment and especially the <UNK> pieces in the <UNK> clinic are <UNK> atmospheric
<START> warning contains a spoiler corny plot and in many cases terrible acting fontaine is great but some others particularly richard <UNK> <UNK> husband are exceedingly wooden <UNK> lies in bed dying of <UNK> <UNK> with every hair in place yet the movie is so <UNK> and so suspenseful more faithful to the book than most movies of its era casting joan fontaine as a <UNK> and an <UNK> which was just as shocking then i'm not kidding kids was a masterful stroke she's just her usual joan <UNK> self as murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space
<START> if you're one of those who <UNK> with pleasure such <UNK> titles as <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> then you should feel right at home with <UNK> a film which also features an occult <UNK> one with the power to change the <UNK> of all involved discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell the <UNK> object has been placed in the wall there by <UNK> a serial killer <UNK> back in the 1920s a man obsessed with <UNK> and the black arts before he abruptly <UNK> <UNK> of the book are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a company <UNK> <UNK> by his wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> to be a woman but at the same time body builds to <UNK> an escape plan the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who once ate his baby sister and the <UNK> marcus <UNK> <UNK> supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife reminding the viewer of meat <UNK> equally bizarre <UNK> male in fight club 1999 <UNK> begins as the <UNK> member of the <UNK> one who is especially protective of the <UNK> <UNK> with the coming of the book however and the <UNK> need to <UNK> its dangerous <UNK> marcus assumes greater and greater significance at first assured of an early <UNK> meanwhile <UNK> takes little more than academic interest in events suddenly he too needs an <UNK> escape option and as the prisoners experiment <UNK> book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers br br staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters <UNK> has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to <UNK> the doomed closed in nature of proceedings elsewhere more than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding i'm going to escape says <UNK> at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to <UNK> his wife and son whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an <UNK> may not be one a man might imagine br br with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first time feature director eric <UNK> credit that his film succeeds as well as it does as critics have noticed it is a film with strong <UNK> overtones <UNK> distinctive <UNK> and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a <UNK> which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who <UNK> back into a <UNK> <UNK> original <UNK> fetish the dark cell as a primitive <UNK> from which <UNK> is <UNK> etc with so many interesting aspects to the script <UNK> hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four <UNK> one <UNK> table and a book there's a genuine growing <UNK> <UNK> as the men <UNK> up the <UNK> darkness from within its pages while one or two moments the aforementioned <UNK> <UNK> or what ultimately happens to <UNK> are <UNK> memorable the pacing of many of the dark events in <UNK> is deliberate <UNK> the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions a video culture approach that often <UNK> the horrified <UNK> in favour of quick fix action and gore perhaps this is a particularly european manner as one recalls a similar <UNK> approach to shocking <UNK> taken in such films as verhoeven's the fourth man 1983 a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a <UNK> eye br br <UNK> well in 1 85 1 <UNK> benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as <UNK> as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking coming so soon after the release of the similarly well received <UNK> tension aka <UNK> romance 2003 this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again <UNK> from the french industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia
<START> this had to be one of the most god awful <UNK> ever and is only saved by 2 matches the hardcore match between edge and mick <UNK> also vince <UNK> against shaun michaels the main event between cena and triple h was a complete <UNK> and to be honest i nearly fell asleep it was so <UNK> the <UNK> match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke if you are really a big fan of the wwe and have missed the early days of the <UNK> and the <UNK> 17 and 19 you'll probably love this but i found that this <UNK> left a lot to be desired
<START> walking the <UNK> between comedy and drama is one of the <UNK> acts in cinema how do you get laughs out of other people's misery and not start feeling bad when it goes on too long br br well this surprising little gem of a movie will deliver great big laughs beautiful scenery and quite a good buzz as well i particularly like the concept that a trick of history made alcohol legal since white europeans liked it and marijuana illegal since <UNK> other <UNK> used it undoubtedly true and exposes a racial side to the marijuana laws so openly <UNK> by <UNK> all over the world br br an extraordinary dvd extra commentary two of them in fact run thru the whole movie with both the actors and then again with the writers i kept seeing things i was sure were not in the first movie but then realizing how easy it is to miss much of the subtle comedy on the first take what a hoot don't miss it 9 10 stars
<START> the <UNK> emotional impact is <UNK> whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad <UNK> if anywhere at all this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end this is no way for people to act and <UNK> both <UNK> all the way through the movie teen killing bad <UNK> sex bad emotional <UNK> bad animal cruelty bad psychological torture bad <UNK> neglect bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of <UNK> red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is ugly

<START> i must admit this is one of my favorite horror films of all time the unique way that john carpenter has directed this picture opening the door to so many mock genres it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your <UNK> the sound the menacing horror of michael meyers and the infamous scream of jamie lee curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era i love the music i love the characters the familiar yet spooky setting the simplistic nature of the villain and the random chaos of it all there is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film giving us a taste of michael's true nature is he insane or in some way just a very brilliant beast that question may never be truly answered but carpenter gives us his 100 and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece br br john carpenter is the master of horror while lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were see ghosts of mars halloween began his <UNK> of a career this is his ultimate film while he did release other <UNK> i will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights beware when <UNK> and check behind closed doors because you never knew where the evil would appear next carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves with the power of his camera he places these images of meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you i loved every scene in which we <UNK> back and there was michael watching from the distance without anyone the <UNK> that was scary yet utterly brilliant i loved the scenes in which carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air there you would be <UNK> your own business when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere like the characters you too thought it was just a trick of the eye but that is where carpenter gets you it isn't michael isn't a ghost he is a human being or at least we think yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters this leads into some really dark themes and <UNK> symbolism but even without that this is a spooky film br br then if you just didn't have enough of michael just <UNK> in the windows of your house carpenter adds that chilling theme music i still have that <UNK> of the piano keys in my mind constantly wondering if meyers is looking at me through the window carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual <UNK> and chilling sounds to <UNK> what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next it is lethal and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's horror hollywood could <UNK> carpenter's halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year with actual scares being replaced by paris hilton you know that the quality isn't quite the same br br finally i would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling the use of the clown mask sent <UNK> up my spine the way that it was filmed with that <UNK> one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror <UNK> ever it completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film you have the babysitter theme you have the childish behavior which carries with michael throughout the film and you have the art talent of carpenter all rolled into one i could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film but instead i would rather go watch it again it is worth the repeat visit many times br br overall i think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight carpenter and the slasher film genre this <UNK> movie <UNK> a whole generation of horror films and still continues to be an influence on modern day horror treats the lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer the powerful cinematography of the events which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films and the beauty of jamie lee curtis is exactly what makes halloween that film above the rest sure freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for jason but michael is real he is troubled and he is on the loose <UNK> for the blood of <UNK> what can be better br br grade out of
<START> i liked this movie cute and funny i found this film to be a good family film the <UNK> part of this movie was when it made references to the new york <UNK> you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny <UNK> is a dirty word sorry to say that to the <UNK> fans i recommend this picture for the entire family of course with your typical love comedy movie there's a long moment in the movie with i'm in love and what do i do but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments the movie show's some moments of how the red sox nation in <UNK> park how the fans felt about <UNK> years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand
<START> the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children and was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of <UNK> that a lot of <UNK> have been doing today which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was <UNK> filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn't like either but in all it was a good movie
<START> on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear i enjoyed this movie dean cain was excellent in the role of bob <UNK> <UNK> character was confusing to understand at first she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart dean <UNK> performance was an usual excellent he gets better with every film he does my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob <UNK> and the baby it was left for the viewer to decide
<START> <UNK> first <UNK> into the world of 3 <UNK> is incredible <UNK> masterpiece was reason enough to buy a <UNK> 64 when it was released in 1996 and it still holds all of it's charm today this game is an instant classic that set the standard for 3d adventure platform games
<START> as much as i like big epic pictures i'll spare you the <UNK> it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes films where the plot takes a <UNK> to the set pieces films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless <UNK> of purple <UNK> there are hundreds of films that fit the bill but in my opinion gone in sixty seconds is one of the better ones br br it's an update of the movie that shares its name it also shares that <UNK> <UNK> but not quite it's execution whatever was great about the original has been <UNK> whatever was <UNK> was also <UNK> up thanks to a bigger budget often these kinds of <UNK> are <UNK> for complete disaster see the <UNK> ugly remake of the italian job for one that blew it but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors sixty succeeds br br the plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write imdb about often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different <UNK> a lot of people found this annoying i find it raises a smile each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with cage jolie and duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see mrs pitt not given first billing here the chemistry between good ol' saint nick the <UNK> see date of review and angelina leads to a couple of nice moments br br the villain is not even a little scary i've seen chris <UNK> play tough guy roles before so i know he can handle them but i think he was deliberately directed to make his role <UNK> as not to distract from the action we know the heroes are going to succeed somehow we're just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride i think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating in fact i wouldn't have minded some fourth wall breaking <UNK> at the camera it's just that kind of movie br br all this style and not so much substance something that often <UNK> my patience if not executed just so would be worthless if the action wasn't there and for the most part it is wonderfully so i've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast cut extreme close up shots to direct action these days i personally find this kind of thing <UNK> i prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension <UNK> by <UNK> tight shots all the time i've been told that cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life i mean his character clearly doesn't care and it shows the man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow burning climatic finale where he drives a <UNK> into the ground in the most outlandish and fun way possible br br so yes this movie isn't an epic life <UNK> post 9 11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort the pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors <UNK> the line but car movies rarely come better than this so if you hate cars why are you even reading these comments br br i'd take it over the numerous <UNK> of the <UNK> and the tedious guess the franchise any day 7 10
<START> hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange <UNK> proves to be no exception although <UNK> the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert <UNK> the movie fails <UNK> on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden <UNK> of fantasy elements <UNK> the viewer's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived <UNK> parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept <UNK> in light ian <UNK> smug know it all as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and <UNK> at least agreed with me the movie was banned few boston detroit <UNK> <UNK> if any complained or <UNK> to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it <UNK> everywhere br br oddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movie's allegory more <UNK> to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange <UNK> flows along predictable heavily <UNK> lines that will have no one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny
<START> two adventurous teenagers best friends take a trip to thailand for one last experience before <UNK> and going off to college it seems like a fun time of <UNK> an exotic land until they meet an attractive stranger who <UNK> them into taking a trip to hong kong and puts drugs in their <UNK> they get <UNK> by the local police and find that justice in asia is very different from justice in the u s br br this is the main story line for <UNK> palace and it was a good one the film does a decent job of portraying the <UNK> and corrupt justice systems of third world nations actually the portrayal was rather mild as the prison conditions are often far worse than depicted it serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is it is <UNK> by comparison to much of the rest of the world br br unfortunately there were too many contrived situations in the film that <UNK> the story the whole escape attempt was bogus fantasy to think that friends would be able to <UNK> money for a <UNK> into the prison in a padded <UNK> and not be discovered by the guards who were <UNK> checking everything brought in from <UNK> assumes that either the guards or the viewers are utter <UNK> br br the story also fails to bring closure to the <UNK> question of how the drugs got in <UNK> claire danes <UNK> did she actually agree to transport the drugs we are left to guess it was intriguing to be kept guessing about the girls' innocence throughout the film but we finish the movie never really knowing if one or both of the girls might be guilty except for this considerable flaw the ending was excellent and the results unexpected br br the acting by claire danes and kate beckinsale was very solid and well done danes who has been <UNK> and over hyped actually arrived as an actor in this film though her portrayal was frequently immature as was her character she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances became more dire beckinsale in contrast has been flying under the radar her whole brief career and shines as the <UNK> two shoes who suddenly finds herself in prison <UNK> was the best performance in the film br br bill <UNK> was miscast as the lawyer his <UNK> and <UNK> style is an asset in films like while you were sleeping but as a lawyer in a third world country on a <UNK> to free two innocent girls from injustice he had the wrong personality br br the <UNK> look at thailand was interesting but it didn't make me want to go there br br overall an entertaining film made implausible in parts by the <UNK> of some ridiculous scenes i gave it a 7 10
<START> of course he did have to <UNK> everything about cinematography film directing etc before he could make classics like the <UNK> so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial <UNK> into mere <UNK> documentary today we call them home movies and they are just as boring now as this one is
<START> this isn't the first time stanley <UNK> the distinction between genres to such great effect either in dr <UNK> you had a comedy about a horrific situation and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually <UNK> some very funny moments slow burning madness and attempting to kill one's family isn't hilarious of course but the dialogue is very knowing five months of peace is just what i want and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be <UNK> if you included just one type of spirit but is spine chilling when you factor in the other br br i disagree with those who say that the hotel has a <UNK> effect on jack <UNK> in the filmed version the <UNK> nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness which is only <UNK> when we learn that the head of the family has <UNK> with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son the environment that he is in however then <UNK> those personality <UNK> and <UNK> them upon his consciousness in much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to <UNK> up events that happen there the hotel <UNK> on the <UNK> of a troubled but sane man and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return he may have <UNK> flaws in his personality before he arrives but to me the overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off br br kubrick's cold and detached approach to directing works <UNK> for a <UNK> horror film and the unpredictable force of nature that is jack nicholson <UNK> all the time between making you giggle and <UNK> the wits out of you when he explodes you won't be sure how far he can go together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic if you want a great viewing experience then this is an example that well and truly shines
<START> twenty years ago the five years old boy michael <UNK> witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael gordon <UNK> invites his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> grant and his best friends chris <UNK> <UNK> jennifer <UNK> <UNK> lisa ann kelly benson ned <UNK> <UNK> mitch <UNK> phillip rhys and <UNK> rachel <UNK> to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest <UNK> fear and together with his indian friend crow byron chief moon they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the <UNK> wooden <UNK> <UNK> jon <UNK> that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and <UNK> turns into his father killing his friends br br the fear <UNK> is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of <UNK> the greatest <UNK> fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms <UNK> <UNK> others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the <UNK> is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with <UNK> minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a b movie my vote is four br br title brazil fear 2 uma <UNK> de halloween fear 2 one night of halloween
<START> my first full heston movie the movie that everyone already knows the ending to a sci fi thriller the campy factor everything that goes with this movie was <UNK> in my head when i rented it and on the morning that i watched it it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that i was in not wanting to move put in player hide in <UNK> and though i tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be <UNK> ruined by pop culture it just really didn't make it everything was all over the place relationships had no <UNK> the ending had no lead in everything was just kind of there in some <UNK> way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially <UNK> at the ending that it gets to because even though we all know that it's people it's quick answers as to why it's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window
<START> ang lee clearly likes to ease into a film to catch action characters and setting on the <UNK> as they emerge covering the <UNK> <UNK> of the american civil war via the <UNK> actions of a young <UNK> <UNK> in mind or <UNK> this is an ideal approach the film turns out to be about the <UNK> of personalities <UNK> and relationships lee also shows the beautiful <UNK> of the mid south as a silent character enduring the <UNK> like a hardy parent br br james <UNK> script is probably the standard <UNK> for this film close behind it are a number of well <UNK> performances that carry it admirably jeffrey <UNK> name alone could carry this film for me he's brilliant here but in a slow burning role instead we are treated to very good if not <UNK> performances from a large often <UNK> ensemble br br a noble optimistic film one to watch if you don't fancy the harder more bittersweet cold mountain or the claim for example 7 10
<START> oh the sixties there were some interesting films i was more of a movie goer then i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater i also saw this short film the legend of the boy and the eagle i have been searching for this film for years it was truly inspiring surprisingly i was finally able to gather more information from your site thank you i'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture i too did not remember the disney film i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime i wonder if <UNK> holds the rights to this film is it available on dvd this is a must see for all generations
<START> the endless <UNK> of our <UNK> to our own kind never fails to <UNK> me this truly astonishing story of a <UNK> abused and largely <UNK> of population is compelling well documented and <UNK> as an american i am constantly <UNK> by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long <UNK> of international <UNK> we suck this is probably the first john <UNK> documentary i've seen but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done my only complaint and the reason i gave this film only 8 out of 10 is that <UNK> shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk <UNK> demands that we viewers citizens are <UNK> in our own <UNK> but makes no suggestion of how to help i don't know about britain but america's made it nearly impossible for the <UNK> to take part in their <UNK> <UNK> a gesture in the right direction might help these <UNK> cause
<START> in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case the movie tries to be funny and tries to make a story about <UNK> and more but it never works the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous i voted 1 10
<START> i liked how this started out featuring some decent special effects especially for a film 50 years old there was some pretty impressive scenery however the film <UNK> down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to <UNK> with anne francis <UNK> <UNK> br br viewing this in the <UNK> after a long absence it was fun to see francis again an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released and is still acting it also was interesting to see a young looking leslie <UNK> dr john j adams who i wouldn't have recognized had it not been for this voice br br i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep i appreciated them re doing this vhs tape in <UNK> but it was a weak effort this is one those overrated film where <UNK> think is so heavy and thought provoking that's nonsense it only appeared intelligent because the rest of the <UNK> sci fi films were so stupid br br some if the early scenes would have looked great on <UNK> which i didn't have at the time of this writing perhaps another look this time on the 2 35 1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review
<START> being a giant monster fan me seeing yeti was an absolute must especially after hearing so much about it thanks to the good <UNK> <UNK> market i was able to find a copy pretty easily and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually dare i say decent br br decent for what it is actually namely a cheesy giant monster flick it kicks in pretty quickly as yeti is found pretty much immediately and we get introduced to various characters they consist of some sleazy ones some good ones and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci fi film by far br br yeti looks like a long haired guy straight out of the original <UNK> concert and really he's not that bad of a dude especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage like thing godzilla he is not despite his rude awakening he doesn't even rampage actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out yeti seems to understand english pretty nicely my copy was dubbed in english and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are br br however we want to see the giant yeti do his thing and he's pretty much in the whole movie and in typical low budget fashion he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there's even a bunch of the fake legs shots of him just standing there br br yes the special effects aren't the greatest but there are definitely some good ones here a scene where yeti <UNK> through a warehouse is done very well and in another he uses the windows of a building as ladder steps to climb down from the top of it shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the <UNK> inside in one sequence that really looks much much better than it should in such a bad movie br br yeti never <UNK> as low as say a p e does actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes <UNK> <UNK> to become <UNK> and he lifts his <UNK> in an oh yeah baby manner but even this isn't that bad and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer br br the movie is pretty long for this kind of thing but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring the story is actually good and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy br br yeti may not be in the upper <UNK> of giant monster flicks but it is definitely better than other king kong <UNK> rip offs like a p e and queen kong by very far
<START> steven seagal appears to be <UNK> through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources to pick on the technical flaws silver f a <UNK> and f <UNK> take of from a <UNK> for an air strike and miraculously become <UNK> f <UNK> for the actual strike would give this movie more credibility than it deserves suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael <UNK> in the same category as marcel <UNK>
<START> i don't know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was <UNK> made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you want the majority of this film is mindless drivel i feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no small feat not only is the acting terrible but the plot is never even close to developed there are countless holes in the story to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore i've never read the book so i can't critique on that but this is the first review that i've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i can't remember the last time i couldn't even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake
<START> ram <UNK> <UNK> has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director he had done a remake <UNK> of godfather with <UNK> and succeeded tremendously <UNK> for <UNK> which he made as <UNK> br br sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most unfortunately he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake br br the acting <UNK> from decent to very good with amitabh bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain <UNK> br br the songs were awful and forgettable the <UNK> <UNK> song came off as a second rate music video br br the worst part was the pacing and the dialogues which were forgettable br br watching the movie in a theatre i found myself waiting for the <UNK> and then for the ending some viewers were wise not to wait and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film ultimately one of the worst movies made by ram <UNK> <UNK>
<START> let's be honest shall we al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about <UNK> foot <UNK> it's a hook make no mistake al gore is a politician three years ago he was <UNK> <UNK> in his home state doing 70 <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> zone driving not a hybrid a <UNK> or even a <UNK> <UNK> but a lincoln go <UNK> it if you like or how about the fact that mr gore his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel <UNK> <UNK> to attend the <UNK> of an <UNK> truth so much for <UNK> huh al anyway it takes a mere minute to <UNK> look at an <UNK> truth discover the main fundamental flaw while the film <UNK> out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed global warming there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it for example i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot they can point out an <UNK> which is not running right but can they tell you with any degree of <UNK> why generally not a second flaw just how accurate were the weather <UNK> 100 years ago the toilet wasn't even invented yet what did they have a june bug in a match box hell even 50 60 years ago therefore how do we know with any degree of <UNK> that the planet is getting <UNK> when the records of <UNK> are highly questionable at best or that man is the sole cause of it the answer is we don't science is never a <UNK> thirty years ago time magazine did a cover <UNK> a new ice age the truth is that any <UNK> grade science teacher well <UNK> in earth science will tell you that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> activity el <UNK> have more to do with our <UNK> changes in climate conditions than supposed global warming finally what al gore fails to adequately address is even if america decides to follow the global <UNK> according to al <UNK> everything he <UNK> how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism answer it's <UNK> thinking mr gore you being a former <UNK> of the usa know it if the folks who produced an <UNK> truth were really honest they would have titled their film al gore wants attention but what i'd really like is for someone to ask the former <UNK> this why were two of the <UNK> biggest <UNK> aka china india <UNK> from <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> anyway i hear the producers of a i t are working on their next film entitled <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> our <UNK> friends
<START> midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice over of the main character joe buck jon voight singing in the shower he is singing a cowboy song the very thing he <UNK> to be joe picks up his <UNK> life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women and even more money he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy but in a cartoonish fashion not even his friends take him seriously he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how <UNK> joe is through his interactions with the other passengers this is primarily a story of <UNK> realization of the harsh realities of the real world br br he starts off as a very <UNK> <UNK> thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks he has no other reason to think otherwise as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical they are <UNK> and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance as they are they are coming out of his past however as joe <UNK> deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past which is no longer whimsical but gritty filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being <UNK> and her being raped in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart the <UNK> that he once carried is falling off of him he and ratso dustin hoffman are living in <UNK> and barely able to get food to eat joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty <UNK> of new york that he didn't <UNK> his <UNK> mirrors the way in which his real life is <UNK> out br br ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe but in an opposite way ratso is <UNK> foil joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good <UNK> appearance ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite he is short dark and always <UNK> with a sheen of sweat he understands how the world works that it is <UNK> and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did they are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different level br br the theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an <UNK> ratso living in the cold of nyc wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from <UNK> perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an <UNK> <UNK> from society br br it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow joe <UNK> to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to <UNK> a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation he dresses ratso the same way he <UNK> to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no <UNK> upon <UNK> death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as <UNK> even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film despite the <UNK> death and <UNK> continued alienation the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman
<START> not one of your harder hitting stories and that's a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all too predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disney ish moments particularly near the end but they are <UNK> overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed fun br br btw if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make <UNK> <UNK> we followed her directions and it was brilliant next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the <UNK> to let the <UNK> out
<START> this must be accompanied by a special rating and warning not recommended to normal people br br the obsession of <UNK> with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare also it's evident that the man is a <UNK> he hates everybody his country his people his actors his job and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago br br this so called film is just a hideous string of disgusting images with no artistic value and no <UNK> knowledge it is an insult to good taste and to good sense shame shame shame
<START> the exploding <UNK> crashing down upon <UNK> <UNK> jude <UNK> base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is first off let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film a cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve i can see the studio pitch now let's combine <UNK> german <UNK> and a 1940's <UNK> adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene wow won't that be a success <UNK> <UNK> the viewer with its sheer excess there are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing <UNK> scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two dimensional after all why shock and awe with one floating <UNK> when you can have three or five or one hundred moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film <UNK> combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important <UNK> of any flick using cgi quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the <UNK> everything seems to be just a little off i'm not being <UNK> <UNK> here in any way an <UNK> could notice that a car doesn't <UNK> along the road like a <UNK> train unless its a <UNK> <UNK> and for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out <UNK> is a stylized film it's not supposed to be like <UNK> let me just say this lord of the rings has set the standard for <UNK> real life actors with cgi starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the <UNK> did a solid job <UNK> the decade of the <UNK> back into the hollywood film <UNK> and tim <UNK> batman created a unique picture of new york city <UNK> that has yet to be repeated sky captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill so there you have it i spent 9 to see this film and you get my review i hope it might <UNK> you all from making the same mistake that i did
<START> as is well known among long haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this <UNK> <UNK> silent <UNK> during <UNK> <UNK> like to travel to <UNK> and distinguished places in order to avoid the heat as well <UNK> of coarse people taking their ease such bizarre travels around the world also happen in three ages a charming and elegant piece of silent work directed by old hands namely <UNK> buster keaton and <UNK> eddie <UNK> br br obviously this german count liked most the first segment focused on the stone age due to the <UNK> that this aristocrat feels about that ancient time <UNK> that to the second segment which takes place during the glory of rome it should have included the cause of the fall of the roman empire that is to say <UNK> or the same thing germans of course the third segment takes place during modern times but this <UNK> aristocrat thinks that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern br br the <UNK> that moves <UNK> keaton and his companions to travel and endure the strange and hilarious happenings during three different ages is the search for love a very complicated subject to understand for <UNK> who prefer the search for money and self interest every time that three ages is shown in the <UNK> theatre it is always a pleasure to watch a funny witty silent film even for a serious german count an <UNK> full of gags and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> visual and astounding technical tricks an absolute silent <UNK> that is perfect to allow one to endure the various and coarse <UNK> <UNK> br br and now if you'll allow me i must <UNK> take my leave because this german count must <UNK> with an old <UNK> <UNK> who doesn't look her age br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> this is one of my favorites along with the <UNK> hartley and robert <UNK> sandy and the <UNK> <UNK> and the tiny <UNK> episodes br br it is an important take from mid <UNK> on the long cold war that the u s was then <UNK> in the beaten down city scene the near starving characters' sparse dialog their <UNK> uniforms and the minimal action says it all the absurdity of an on going conflict that threatens to destroy human life modern civilization and all that is sweet and redeeming about it br br it is a fable because it was made in a time in which had events turned out differently such as the second berlin crisis spring <UNK> and the subsequent cuban missile crisis <UNK> <UNK> it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u s 's major cities ruined and <UNK> with a few miserable survivors i also see it as a fable because it is not only a <UNK> tale but because it is the most <UNK> of all our popular <UNK> it is a love story set in an impossible situation and involving two highly <UNK> lovers
<START> steven seagal mr personality himself this time is the united <UNK> greatest stealth pilot who is promised a <UNK> from the military who attempted to <UNK> his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base later caught after <UNK> a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station if he is able to successfully <UNK> a northern afghanistan terrorist base <UNK> by a group called black sunday who have <UNK> an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american <UNK> along with a fellow pilot who admired the <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> john <UNK> seagal will fly into enemy territory receiving help from his arab lover jessica <UNK> <UNK> and a freedom fighter <UNK> <UNK> david once they are on ground <UNK> is kidnapped by black sunday leaders stone vincenzo <UNK> and his female <UNK> <UNK> katie jones and <UNK> must figure out how to not only re take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter but rescue him as well and maybe <UNK> can get revenge on the <UNK> he trained rather steve <UNK> in the process <UNK> has <UNK> hours until a <UNK> navy pilots bomb the entire area on board the stealth black sunday <UNK> a <UNK> bomb hoping to <UNK> it on the united states br br seagal gets a chance to shoot <UNK> when he isn't <UNK> their throats with knives the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead the setting of afghanistan doesn't hold up to <UNK> nor does how easily seagal and co are able to move about the area <UNK> so easily and the plot itself is nothing to write home about the movie is edited fast the camera a bit too jerky seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his <UNK> unlike the good old days one of <UNK> <UNK> efforts and he's as understated as ever not a compliment even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains <UNK> a shame he doesn't even snap a <UNK> or crack a neck in any visible way sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around but it's not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and <UNK> close ups
<START> one of cary <UNK> most enduring comedies is mr blandings builds his dream house although judging by the size of it the <UNK> would be a dream mansion today still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a <UNK> for ham with the brand name of <UNK> br br what made this film so popular was the <UNK> <UNK> of the post world war ii years returning veterans from the war were claiming their <UNK> under the <UNK> bill of rights which included home <UNK> the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand around the time the book by eric <UNK> and the film were so popular <UNK> passed and president truman signed the <UNK> <UNK> wagner <UNK> law which put the government for the first time in the home building business br br i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester their place wasn't quite as grand as a house in <UNK> with <UNK> rooms still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did br br of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up threatening to send cary to the <UNK> cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer <UNK> usually too late truth be told he's kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it br br myrna <UNK> role is simply an <UNK> of nora charles if you can imagine the <UNK> moving to the country and william powell having the <UNK> cary grant does the film would still work just fine br br mr blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over 40 years
<START> as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and <UNK> with laughter as <UNK> billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film <UNK> usual charm and <UNK> comedy are <UNK> from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself <UNK> character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of <UNK> he claims to <UNK> from and whenever he does deliver a line it's several <UNK> higher than any other cast member <UNK> tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable country <UNK> <UNK> but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot <UNK> looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex <UNK> and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray <UNK> character was <UNK> and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the <UNK> leave i've ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i won't spoil that for anyone i will tell you that it's the most absurd you'll ever see the film tries to spark <UNK> and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary
<START> if i have to give this movie a score on a linear scale then i have to give it a low score 3 10 br br but it was entertaining and there are several good things to say about the movie br br the psychiatrist candidate james bishop is assigned to st andrews hospital for his resident and is <UNK> and eager to change the world br br from the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth but james thinks he can make a difference and doesn't <UNK> this evil br br the story builds fairly well you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil and wonder when and how james will discover this also when the break comes james is in a way hunted by the evil and you feel some suspense until the fight is over br br add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements and you get the picture br br the character <UNK> is actually fairly good you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed some of them you get to know br br the film sets an unpleasant scene this is also done fairly well there are mysteries that are <UNK> in an acceptable way br br the main character james is very believable the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting br br what kills this movie is stupid special effects a modern version of plan 9 from outer space type bad the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow some bad acting or probably very few takes when filming the main characters sometimes acts badly and <UNK> good the sound is at times very cheap br br i kept thinking i could make a movie like this with my home video camera throughout the film
<START> this flick reminds me some really bad science fiction movies from 50's and 60's it is not scary or interesting but it's dull cheesy and stupid special effects are laughable all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful don't waste your money rent or buy something better i give it 3 5 out of 10 i found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity
<START> people tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people i don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people <UNK> van <UNK> does a wonderful job with the script and direction daniel <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> work perfectly together with <UNK> basically playing himself the film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in rain man the ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come before br br 7 8 out of 10
<START> excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting br br maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already
<START> this was a crappy movie with a whole <UNK> non sense and too many loose ends to count i only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ron <UNK> made a cameo in it and i continued watching it because as a girl i love any movie that includes male nudity for a change later i found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get and each time it got more ridiculous br br sean <UNK> good looking chris l <UNK> whom i've never seen before but loved his little nude scene is making ends meet as a painter when he meets <UNK> duke wayne george <UNK> from cheers thinking he's getting more work from duke sean agrees to meet <UNK> ray <UNK> daniel baldwin playing a <UNK> evil guy ray is being <UNK> by a city hall <UNK> ron <UNK> in a cameo who i've been in love with from office space up to sex the city ray end up offering the apparently desperate for cash sean <UNK> to kill the <UNK> and sean accepts the job sean stalks out the <UNK> whose wife <UNK> <UNK> he finds himself attracted to <UNK> the hit and leaves taking the file of information against ray with him sean quickly learns he was being used that ray never intended to pay him and sean uses the file as <UNK> to get his money br br up to this point it's a descent flick generally worth watching but as soon as ray duke and their crew kidnap sean to muscle the information about the file out of him it just got dumber and dumber and still dumber until finally it seemed like the film's writer charlie <UNK> had <UNK> out of a 10 day writing <UNK> and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible <UNK> he created before a <UNK> or something without simply <UNK> the movie let's just say that in every single scene you watch after the kidnapping you find yourself <UNK> what the f k <UNK> by the ongoing nonsense as sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption in the end so many loose ends are left in the movie that you begin to regret that you even watched it br br this is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it's full value it's supposed to be a psychological thriller and <UNK> is a decent actor but it's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have norm from cheers and a baldwin brother doing the dirty work and a kidnapping <UNK> that really makes no damned sense guys will love the violence blood and guts scenes and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and <UNK> shots girls will enjoy handsome <UNK> gratuitous <UNK> shot in a mainstream movie when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie personally i hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ron <UNK> is only in the first one third of the movie
<START> i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing this movie has the worst acting since <UNK> br br here is a brief outline of the plot the movie starts out with <UNK> and that other chick sitting around on the beach <UNK> over a skinny blonde haired beach hunk who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life somehow everyone knows him and every single chick in the movie wants him uh oh here comes the competition the stereotypical hot chick and her best friends who drive an ugly pink car we soon find out <UNK> mom got the job of a lifetime in australia which means that <UNK> would have to move and leave her best friend behind oh no i think i'm gonna cry a huge storm comes and fills their swimming pool with nasty water somehow for no apparent reason the little chick falls into the pool and comes face to face with <UNK> you guessed it a mermaid this is where the story really takes off basically they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the hunk br br this is a <UNK> flick with acting so bad it makes the 80's look like the <UNK> of oscar worthy performances this movie has all the clichés possible the best friends the hunk who everyone wants the hot bad girl and her bitchy friends the scary old man you name it it's in there i took one for a lot of people by watching this consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you please don't see this movie don't make it so i suffered in vain
<START> this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget cameo type roles well executed the story is a little weak a recently widowed <UNK> <UNK> decides to round up the blonde <UNK> a all well almost all girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory son daughter who thinks she's gone <UNK> i did like the way the movie lets young people see that they don't have a <UNK> on feelings love and even lust that the old <UNK> can have a good laugh too <UNK> <UNK> was superb as always a pity we didn't get to see more of the other blonde <UNK> the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian <UNK> although he was quite adequate as the <UNK> drummer all in all a <UNK> movie well worth a night in with the girls
<START> i can't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i laughed a couple of times probably because of how stupid it was if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn't the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldn't even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating f
<START> this movie is a mess but at least it's not pretentious the box art for the video <UNK> it as a fun <UNK> to 1950s giant bug movies in reality it's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of aliens br br the producers clearly wanted to make an alien picture but they <UNK> have had much money in fact it doesn't look like they had any money really i hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing br br the basic plot is <UNK> group of people isolated with murderous <UNK> creature and an <UNK> location is inserted for <UNK> reasons i presume instead of setting the film in space where no one can hear you scream they set the film in a hospital where everyone can see your budget laid bare the amusing thing about blue monkey and there is only one thing amusing about it is the filmmakers didn't abandon the alien <UNK> even though we're in a hospital we still have an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where science fiction experiments are being <UNK> in this case the <UNK> growth <UNK> plot device the <UNK> also <UNK> as a <UNK> room or something so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth the <UNK> room is so large that it is laced with multi <UNK> steel <UNK> perfect for allowing <UNK> to <UNK> down between the <UNK> br br the idea is that a man working in a <UNK> is attacked by a <UNK> flower from a rare <UNK> plant that grows in an exotic location he touches it and says <UNK> so we know he's been hurt the cut on his finger causes him to <UNK> into <UNK> in a matter of minutes and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth i guess in an alien picture this would be called the <UNK> the worm is isolated but some naughty little kids <UNK> patients sneak up on it and accidentally give it some experimental growth <UNK> you know everyone's in trouble when some <UNK> hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a <UNK> and pretty soon a <UNK> man finds some obligatory <UNK> right before he's grabbed by a pair of semi convincing <UNK> arms the rest of the movie is dominated by the semi <UNK> monster semi <UNK> by the semi darkness br br which brings us back to alien how you ask can a movie set in a hospital <UNK> all those flashing <UNK> lights that are always in the alien movies no problem a power <UNK> or something causes the <UNK> system to go awry which apparently causes <UNK> lights to <UNK> in every room of the hospital and <UNK> constantly throughout the movie this <UNK> as a convenient cloak for the less than special effects although the bugs are pretty neat looking they don't move too well and the baby bug looks <UNK> like a <UNK> toy br br ok so what alien <UNK> haven't we covered oh water dripping down the walls check we'll <UNK> the massive hospital into two parts then send some of the characters through the <UNK> <UNK> basement to get to the other side problem solved we now have the opportunity for numerous foreboding tunnel shots and don't forget the fog well you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies do you ok maybe inside of a hospital you do so we'll create smoke by having lots of things spark burn br br i haven't said anything about the <UNK> acting not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow i take it blue monkey was supposed to be lighthearted and fun and if so then it is a nice try but the pieces don't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag see a film called return of the aliens the deadly <UNK> if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right with even less money and even more <UNK> acting talent this one falls flat on its alien
<START> the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on so so story horrible cast ajay <UNK> <UNK> with salman khan and <UNK> you gotta be kidding me the music was okay <UNK> was the track of the movie the rest was bad <UNK> shah hasn't still learn from <UNK> is king's <UNK> <UNK> comedy now <UNK> where do she come from sorry for <UNK> fan out there but she suck d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all <UNK> of make up my final verdict go watch <UNK> with your family instead wasting your time here
<START> this film was just <UNK> brilliant it actually made me think during the whole movie i was confused as hell i loved everything about it it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird it was hard not to love it all of the actors were <UNK> and no one could have done a better job this is one of my favorites of the year it deserves an <UNK>
<START> of course the original is better but this isn't as bad as everyone says yes it is made up into 3 stories but hey so what i thought it was quite good to be honest i actually liked how <UNK> changed a little when she fell in love it shows what love can do the stories were not so bad either br br i liked <UNK> voice better in this too i have nothing against her voice in the original but i just think it sounds better here more <UNK> i liked her personality in this too she had more of a <UNK> yet she was still kind br br so i'll give cinderella ii dreams come true a 7 10
<START> if you would like to see a film of different kind if you feel the love in your heart even if you miss the lord this film makes you think although georges is mentally handicapped you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love gives you directions not the brain i am not emotional but this film makes you feel the human being the film is as good as forrest <UNK> in my belief the foreign movies are sometimes more interesting yet there is not enough <UNK> to make them popular <UNK> e <UNK> the color of the god by <UNK> <UNK> is another example of such foreign movies almost with similar taste
<START> this is a haunting powerful italian adaptation of james m <UNK> novel the <UNK> always rings twice directed by the great <UNK> visconti what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it <UNK> it's source material to become something <UNK> and more original interestingly <UNK> also credits <UNK> novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the <UNK> equivalent of <UNK> narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender <UNK> very american novel is also <UNK> fascinated with the construction of <UNK> the lead character <UNK> is <UNK> afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in this allows the class <UNK> to take center stage and dance among the <UNK> of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters this film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience
<START> wow watching this film today you can't help but be appalled by the writing of this film spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who in modern times might be featured on the jerry springer show as they have a sick and abusive relationship and inexplicably the writers appear to be <UNK> it br br the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the <UNK> by the poor but very <UNK> spencer tracy he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay it's never clear whether or not they marry and considering it's a pre code film you can assume they aren't even though they are <UNK> their relationship is very strange and rather sick while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions he is <UNK> abusive and a total jerk and young comes running back for more like some sort of dog he calls her skinny or ugly and these are in a sick way his way of using <UNK> later when he starts <UNK> around with another woman glenda farrell she tells her friend that if that's what he wants it's okay with her it sure <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> relationship and you can't help but feel a bit horrified sure he doesn't hit her but the relationship is very abusive to show how sick it is when young gets pregnant she tells him it's your baby and it's mine but you don't need to worry i'll take all the blame for it <UNK> doesn't this all seem a bit like looking through a <UNK> into a sick and dysfunctional home later in a case of art imitating life tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears after all he can't be <UNK> with a baby even if it's his but he changes his mind and decides to return home wow that's bit of him and when he returns he's nasty and acts like if he stays he isn't <UNK> to care for the kid and she tells him he's a free man free as a bird wow i was almost in tears at this tender moment not soon this crazy pair are married and naturally young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him not because of any love or sense of responsibility so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters what would you do well as for the writers they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat the romantic aspects of the film are <UNK> to say the least during the robbery tracy behaves like a <UNK> doing almost nothing to take <UNK> not to get caught like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison and to show what sort of nice guy he is the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends br br while there's more to the film the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film despite both being very good actors there's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced nice music nice sets good acting and a script that is 100 poo how the film is currently rated 7 4 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters a horrible misfire that somehow didn't destroy the careers of those involved br br oh and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a <UNK> in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong the answer is no by the end she's learned nothing and hasn't changed one <UNK> for the better br br they sure don't make films like they used to and in this case thank god
<START> speaking solely as a movie i didn't really liked it not because there were no fx or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film actually that was what kept me watching it br br i didn't like it because the acting was shady his friends are all happy and then they're mad but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles one is the believer other is the antagonist but they never really make the point also the lighting was terrible and i'm just mentioning technical issues br br in a few words i thing the movie could have just had a ok i'm outta here from some characters like the lady who doesn't want to hear his version of the bible br br about the story itself everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination i credit the book author for that hence my 4 10 br br so in the end hear the man's story believe it or not just don't spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don't believe him br br <UNK> br br thanks for reading
<START> letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office here alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss frank a quiet little aussie <UNK> that came and went at the cinema now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop overshadowed by fifty copies of that <UNK> godzilla film it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads this film succeeds where <UNK> <UNK> other dead letter office <UNK> dear god 1996 usa failed and comes close to the brilliance of not the kevin <UNK> turkey but he <UNK> <UNK> 1995 china
<START> if you're watching this without an <UNK> of an idea what the story is about then you're in for quite the surprise even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline but the actual film is anything but br br as the synopsis went it tells of an obsessed mountain <UNK> which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl which tells you of the presence of <UNK> an imaginary city that exists in dreamy <UNK> of the mind note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights where its inhabitants are <UNK> yearning for a change in their <UNK> they can see our world and notice of all persons this mountain <UNK> and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through <UNK> creating an intelligent <UNK> to meet the man br br what that translated to is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce have <UNK> created though credit goes to the stop motion style and put it through a mind numbing loop and repeat until your eyes start to close then move on to the next scene if anything the <UNK> if this term exists really love their sticks and balls constantly playing at <UNK> up that magical <UNK> and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the other world it gets no better as well when the man <UNK> with the <UNK> in yet another <UNK> boring and sleep inducing sequence br br thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised which is <UNK> minutes or less against the 70 stated while firmly dated its dull colours non existent story <UNK> soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans don't waste time
<START> <UNK> bound the incredible journey is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general together with other animal movies like old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and air bud this means it is more than just a movie about pets br br can this possibly be just a remake it is too good to be a remake i know this one by heart since my early teen years when i was 12 br br it's a family movie to treasure it's emotional thrilling adventurous exciting entertaining humorous charming sweet nostalgic beautiful heartwarming and sometimes dramatic it's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films br br this movie does not lack qualities it has a well thought story enjoyable characters excellent and relaxing <UNK> soundtrack dazzling <UNK> landscapes of the magnificent <UNK> mountains in <UNK> speaking of the <UNK> it's not all mountains <UNK> trees rivers <UNK> <UNK> in conclusion all of pure <UNK> wonders truly a full <UNK> br br the main human characters are nice well developed and well portrayed by respective actors robert <UNK> is awesome as the kind hearted dad bob <UNK> kim <UNK> is good as laura <UNK> <UNK> lauren is equally good as hope kevin <UNK> is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin <UNK> in old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is great as peter <UNK> br br when it comes to our <UNK> pals shadow is my favorite shadow is the loyal wise mature beautiful caring and loving old golden <UNK> brilliantly voiced by don <UNK> chance the american <UNK> is the opposite of shadow he is <UNK> silly <UNK> anxious clumsy hilarious and loves to play voiced by the talented michael j fox chance just can't stand still sassy is the epitome of <UNK> image elegant independent very confident and self proud with a typical cat attitude but with a certain <UNK> charm sassy is a seal point <UNK> cat one of the most beautiful cat <UNK> sassy is voiced by sally field who also does a good job br br our four <UNK> friends are themselves great actors by nature ben as shadow <UNK> as chance and <UNK> as sassy br br it's an underrated movie but a classic by its own right its sequel is clearly inferior br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> as a child the first installment the little mermaid was my favorite movie it was filled with great characters songs and a fun family film a week or so again i watched this movie for the first time i believe that this movie was like most sequels and didn't <UNK> their original i think that i feel this way possibly because i had high expectations and i have grown up however it is not a bad film br br it starts when ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child melody eric and ariel feel threatened by morgana <UNK> sister so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea as melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go trouble <UNK> up as morgana tries to take control of the seven <UNK> br br i don't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out i did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing i think this is a good family film though overall

according to rock his longtime co writers and he thought that they could <UNK> this classic moreover he justified his choice of heaven can wait based on his philosophy to do something you can only do when you're hot earlier rock rejected a script about a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing as a lifeless comedian in down to earth rock doesn't so much stretch his image as he <UNK> it for the worst this half baked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to <UNK> his comic reputation as it does the <UNK> brothers you know a film about a comedian is in dire <UNK> when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes only the laughter similarly the casting of mark <UNK> as <UNK> butler who speaks the <UNK> english but is in reality a <UNK> from <UNK> defies logic too <UNK> is an actual <UNK> and he doesn't have to fake an accent his accent is genuine the major <UNK> <UNK> with down to earth is the on again off again look a like <UNK> that the characters make so chris rock doesn't disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds although chris spends half the movie as white guy <UNK> audiences see him largely as lance <UNK> the comic irony of watching his <UNK> bald headed <UNK> white alter ego perform ghetto humor and <UNK> <UNK> hip hop lyrics incredibly rock served double duty as the film's executive producer and one of its four <UNK> the mystery is how such a wealth of talent could <UNK> out such an awkward misguided <UNK> of a comedy about the only redeeming feature of down to earth is <UNK> <UNK> superb <UNK> film score
<START> unfortunately for sarah silverman this show doesn't compliment her at all the character isn't even remotely likable and it's not a situation where you think oh she's such i b <UNK> i love her just she's such a b <UNK> this character is just a plain old self righteous mean b <UNK> sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she's the only semi funny one in it the mood the dialogue it's all so damn boring and dry it's like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the <UNK> he <UNK> as a kid br br the sarah silverman program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of married with children something that is funny because the characters are so <UNK> and rude i'm sorry but i don't find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry bitter <UNK> angry bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like keanu reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny i can't stand this show even though generally i find sarah silverman to be that i love her cause she's such a b <UNK> character like in school of rock and most of her stand up i think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value <UNK> the constant <UNK> <UNK> and hit in general for laughs the sarah silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers someone compared it to south park but it's not even close i've expressed my opinions on the sarah silverman program and won't become an annoying <UNK> meaning you won't see me being a b <UNK> and constantly <UNK> stuff like this show sucks and why isn't this cancelled yet i don't like the sarah silverman program if you do enjoy
<START> considering the original film version of 'the haunting is in my top ten films of all <UNK> i approached this adaption with <UNK> i was right to be <UNK> as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old <UNK> all those involved should be ashamed the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason you see nothing robert wise used innovative camera work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it <UNK> the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and <UNK> to get from a to b <UNK> still is that the ingredients were there actors such as liam neeson catherine zeta jones to do something different this film should only watched as an example of studio <UNK>
<START> although recognized as the best film treatment of the difficulties of having a house in the country built or bought to your <UNK> it is not the first nor the last in 1940 jack benny and ann sheridan were the leads in the film version of the comedy george washington slept here by george s kaufman and moss hart and about fifteen years ago <UNK> long and tom hanks had the lead in the money pit the former was about moving into an 18th century country house that <UNK> needs work the latter was about building your dream house in the late 1980s although the two films have their moments both are not as good as blandings which was based on an <UNK> novel of the same name br br jim blandings and his wife muriel cary grant and myrna loy are <UNK> the tight <UNK> of their apartment which they share with their two daughters joan and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and connie marshall although blandings has a good <UNK> as an advertising executive in 1948 he is making 15 000 00 a year which was like making 90 000 00 today and lives in a luxury apartment which in the new york city of that day he <UNK> he feels they should seek something better he and muriel take a drive into the country <UNK> and soon find an old ruin that both imagine can be fixed up as that dream house they want br br and they both fall into the financial worm hole that buying land and construction can lead to for one thing they are so <UNK> ho about the idea of building a home like this they fail to <UNK> warning after warning by their wise if cynical friend and lawyer bill cole <UNK> douglas in a nicely <UNK> role for example jim buys land from a <UNK> dealer ian <UNK> sucking his chops quietly with a check before double checking the correct cost for the land in that part of <UNK> bill points out he's paid about five or six thousand dollars more for the land than it is worth there are problems about water supply that both blandings just never think about such as hard and soft water which leads to the <UNK> <UNK> water <UNK> machine they find that the designs they have in mind and have worked out with their architect <UNK> <UNK> can't be dropped cheaply at a <UNK> of the moment decision by muriel to build a little <UNK> that nobody planned for br br the <UNK> costs of the project are one matter that <UNK> jim he has been <UNK> to handle the <UNK> account <UNK> had become a popular result of world war ii in that the public started using it as a meat substitute in the light of it's success with the armed forces jim can't get a grip on this he's not alone one or two other executives <UNK> it before him he comes up with the following bit of poetry br br this little <UNK> went to market br br he was pink and as pretty as ham br br he <UNK> in his tracks br br as they gave him the <UNK> br br he knew he would end up as <UNK> br br his secretary looks at him as though he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one br br jim also is increasingly suspicious of the <UNK> of bill to muriel although in this case bill is <UNK> but he's always around jim keeps forgetting that bill is the <UNK> one and that he's keeping jim and muriel from making so many mistakes all three have <UNK> the best being when they get locked in a room in the half constructed house just as the men have left for the day they can't open the door and jim in a panic tries breaking the door down by a make shift <UNK> ram he breaks a window and the door opens by itself br br the film works quite <UNK> with all of the actors apparently enjoying themselves it is one film which despite changing price levels and <UNK> levels really does not age at all after all most americans dream of <UNK> their own home and always have br br a number of years ago a paint company made use of a delightful scene with myrna loy and <UNK> <UNK> regarding the paint job <UNK> company has to do on the various rooms she carefully shows the distinct shades of red blue etc she wants even giving a polite <UNK> a single thread for the right <UNK> of blue the commercials hinted that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paint job they proudly called loy mrs blandings in the <UNK> introduction you can imagine though how the no nonsense <UNK> handles the situation afterward when loy leaves him with his paint crew
<START> i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright <UNK> the movie i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me before i start my review let me first say this it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner yet the writers and scott chose a different approach br br plot br br simply stated it's not boring most hollywood movies give <UNK> and <UNK> plots that they know will connect with people often <UNK> the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher <UNK> of profit this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while just for reference i recently watched 'the weather man' and <UNK> of <UNK> and while i will say that these movies are excellent and i enjoyed them both tremendously both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told they don't take any chances whatsoever and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films <UNK> plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking oh man they're screwed now and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films it has a lot of depth to it in my opinion and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it overall this is what kept me so interested in the movie br br characters br br i felt that the characters were accurate knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that br br <UNK> was also very believable his use of spanish in inappropriate situations his reactions to <UNK> lack of affection as well as his jealousy issues within the team they all <UNK> true to me which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic br br <UNK> character was the least interesting to me but it still <UNK> true to me he seemed like an ordinary guy trying to make ends meet i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes yet is still trying to live br br <UNK> ladies i believe that they provided much needed <UNK> to the story they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a <UNK> these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal you could empathize with them because to them this child's illness was a problem with no other solution these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help br br the <UNK> they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can and i really liked that part they also padded the story with small <UNK> that made the plot that much more interesting br br christopher walken <UNK> guys br br they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie from <UNK> awkward statements to the <UNK> references to the <UNK> guys being has <UNK> their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable br br cinematography yes the cinematography this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans but in my opinion i thought it was genius the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement just like anything else i both applaud and <UNK> scott the editor the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie not only did they go far and above with its presentation they went that much further the use of colors both extremely light and extremely dark provided the <UNK> of the film with a sinister and <UNK> look that accurately depicts the life of the mob bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as <UNK> or <UNK> as everyone else if you notice in times of less stress or conflict there were very few camera tricks if any at all this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach hollywood films have grown predictable and bland most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different br br granted this movie isn't for everyone but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it i would recommend this to all but i'm sure it will only hit a <UNK> with few i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the <UNK> of <UNK> won't appreciate this movie but i think many people will we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique and with that in mind i think he succeeded tremendously
<START> these type of movies about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and daring a couple of years ago but more and more movies like this got made over the past few years making it hard for the movies to still stand out really br br also this movie received little publicity aside from the usual little film festivals that featured this little french movie as well as the big festivals that are always fond of these type of little movies about everyday subjects that aren't being handled too often in movies the film premiered at cannes in 2007 and actually won some awards there as well br br the movie doesn't really stand out from others since it actually features little new once you've already seen some similar movies such as this one but this however really doesn't mean that <UNK> des <UNK> is a bad one to watch the movie is certainly a good watch that handles its subject well and tells its story <UNK> and therefore also effectively in a typical somewhat slow french cinematic pace br br it's a coming of age movie that focus on the life of mainly 3 totally different mid teenagers sexuality is a big theme within the movie which gets handled <UNK> and subtle it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one though perhaps a bit predictable since the movie doesn't quite offer anything original enough within its genre br br this type of french movie will probably scare off a lot of people because of the reason that they probably expect it to be very arty with deep layers and meanings to it <UNK> des <UNK> however is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be into euro teen movies to appreciate this movie it's a sweet and somewhat sensual kind of movie due to its subject and visual approach br br the movie is also being made realistic by its actors who don't had and have a lot of experience within the movie business but are authentic looking and feeling within their roles the strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments br br a good movie on its subject br br 7 10
<START> this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever br br 1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how br br 2 not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day br br 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned away br br please for the love of everything holy don't rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes <UNK> for <UNK> this on the public
<START> i am not saying that night of the <UNK> was horrible but it was far from great mediocre at absolute best i seems though that every time one type of movie is released a second must be around the same time think about <UNK> and deep impact <UNK> and <UNK> peak night of the <UNK> is really just <UNK> except worse and with mundane special effects br br i have nothing against the actors who starred in it even if they weren't great it was the movie itself the directing the special effects the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret a series of <UNK> strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage br br i really don't know why it seems as though <UNK> of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other but this one would have been better with bill paxton and helen hunt
<START> i disagree strongly with anyone who might dismiss this film as just entertainment set right after the <UNK> roaring <UNK> during the early days of the great depression dance fools dance is at its heart an earnest <UNK> tale with a clear message about how best to endure these hard times yet this fast paced and tightly plotted film is far from being a dreary morality tale br br in the 30s hollywood had a knack for <UNK> out one entertaining and <UNK> audience <UNK> after another all without wasting a frame of film dance fools dance one of four films that harry <UNK> directed in 1931 is barely 80 minutes long yet its characters are well developed its story never seems rushed and despite its many twists in plot the audience is never left behind br br with the lone exception of lester <UNK> as <UNK> love interest bob <UNK> the supporting cast is uniformly strong worthy of note are william <UNK> as <UNK> brother cliff <UNK> best known as the voice of <UNK> <UNK> as reporter bert <UNK> and clark gable in an early supporting role as gangster jake <UNK> br br but this is joan <UNK> film and she absolutely shines in it made when she was just 27 this lesser known version of crawford will probably be <UNK> to those more familiar with her later work however here is proof that long before she took home an oscar for mildred pierce crawford was a star in the true sense of the word a terrific actress with the charisma to carry a picture all by herself br br score eight out of ten
<START> unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event but <UNK> have the balls to <UNK> document what happened the constant <UNK> of how violent video games are not to blame i get the impression ben <UNK> is an avid <UNK> or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their <UNK> talk about subtlety but the movie only gets away with it because its <UNK> nice try yes its a great idea to <UNK> media of influence but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting <UNK> influenced by media or video games we dont and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely <UNK> the media yet dumb enough to <UNK> a nazi symbol on the ground haha i somehow dont think so br br the movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the <UNK> of the families its almost doing a <UNK> to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow <UNK> why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem normal when they are so obviously not a completely false and phony depiction
<START> for those of you who've never heard of it or seen it on a e cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight chain smoking <UNK> psychologist named <UNK> who helps the <UNK> police department get into the heads of violent criminals it's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england and that's saying something and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993 br br now the original stars have re teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2 hour episode i've loved this show ever since i'd first seen it over a decade ago the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection and i can quote a good deal of <UNK> <UNK> scenes practically word for word the idea of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with jimmy <UNK> for another tv movie about <UNK> filled me with absolute glee br br i'll start with the good one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly <UNK> was defined as a character five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture throwing the books into the air his drinking and his <UNK> of the guy after him on the gambling machine <UNK>  and you knew simply knew who this character was you could feel him <UNK> in your mind the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer br br <UNK> of course remained great throughout the show but i always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by <UNK>  <UNK> the character br br so the good news is this <UNK> is back as soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter's wedding  you'll feel that click once again it's him <UNK> one moment and truly sorry the next always insightful sincere to the point of <UNK> but brilliantly funny in the process if you love this character as much as i do you'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie and this <UNK> to <UNK> and mark in fact everything having to do with the <UNK> is handled perfectly br br the problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime <UNK> is trying to solve in standard cracker fashion we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing <UNK> figure it out in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood and the reason for this unfortunately is not due to any believable psychological trauma  rather it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs br br it's difficult for me to write this as i truly believe that jimmy <UNK> is one of the greatest writers in the world nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues or movies that take a political stand but in the cracker universe we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings not like caricatures instead the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion they're know nothing <UNK> who complain about everything treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes i honestly thought i'd <UNK> switched channels or something br br but it doesn't stop there we get constant <UNK> of just how badly the war in iraq is going  <UNK> that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere the killer is so busy <UNK> about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing but more to the point he is such a <UNK> for the writer's political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being and thus we  as an audience  don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial killing soul br br i can't say that this ruined the show for me  it's was still good tv better than almost everything else in the genre mainly due to once again <UNK> but its constant <UNK> made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like to be a somebody  an episode that was just as <UNK> but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth br br two other small points <UNK> not being around is a disappointment but what's worse are her <UNK> the entire police department  which for so long filled with such great characters is now full of vanilla completely <UNK> cops who lack any and all personality how you could drain <UNK> richard <UNK> of personality is beyond me but it is indeed missing here br br also there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me one such instance revolves around <UNK> having to narrow down the entire population of <UNK> from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange <UNK> french windows how does the computer know if i have french windows  he not only succeeds in doing this but he succeeds in less than an hour i don't think so br br so all in all i was a little disappointed it's recommended viewing but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door still if there's new series to come after this it would all have been for the good i'm convinced that <UNK> can still write great stuff and maybe now that he's got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people
<START> on the face of it this should be a great film a great cast a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood's finest behind the camera for the first time br br however its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again this movie fails on so many levels in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations it is <UNK> that suspense and continuity are provided by the director not so here the great cast is horribly under used none more so than the great late john spencer the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven't seen in a hundred other tv movies there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and <UNK> in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
<START> this complete mess of a movie was directed by bill <UNK> the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti classic monster a go go as i was <UNK> the end of the cold i came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60's shocker the story  such as it is  is about three eccentric <UNK> who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win 1 000 000 it's a very simple plot but <UNK> still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible things happen characters are completely forgotten about nothing makes too much sense and then it ends <UNK> i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly i guess you are left to draw your own conclusions production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard in truth pamela <UNK> <UNK> isn't even that good she is so unbelievably terrible she's compelling sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap fest as a whole it's just a bargain basement <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie last year in media class and i have to say i really hated it i was in year 10 and aged 15 so that may have has something to do with it but for english this year year 11 we had to read animal farm also by george <UNK> aside from the fact that the book is based on the revolution my opinion is that it is a terrible book and i also hated it br br but 1984 i think it was the most disturbing movie i have ever seen and i think that george <UNK> is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet i'm sorry to everyone who loved his work but i unfortunately did not the themes in the movie were well portrayed but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards this is only my opinion and i'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film
<START> this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made and that says a lot don't get fooled by the rating it's way too good this abomination hadn't even been worthy of a 0 10 rating if such a thing existed br br absolutely no plot br br worst action scenes ever and there aren't too many of them either br br seagal doesn't do anything himself including the fighting talking lots of dubbing and so on as always br br seagal is fat lazy and couldn't care less about this movie something which is very obvious all the way through br br take all the other garbage <UNK> movies seagal has made <UNK> them with each other <UNK> this with a thousand <UNK> and all the badness you then get won't even describe 1 of this absolute <UNK>
<START> i love this show now i'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows so if it <UNK> any resemblance to them i didn't notice i like the <UNK> quality of the cinematography i even like the love story even though as i am enjoying it i wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as ned cannot touch chuck or else well you know i even like chuck i don't find her annoying at all and i generally hate overly sweet nice perfect characters i even like the <UNK> voice even if it bothers one of my family members and <UNK> some resemblance to some <UNK> commercials i could <UNK> about all the other things about <UNK> <UNK> and how the writers are going to address it in the future but i just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers <UNK>
<START> i really thought this wasn't that bad not a great work of art but <UNK> m was the stronger performer by far patricia arquette was overacting much of the time he was actually playing <UNK> which was very impressive and his lines were never forced besides he is an incredibly beautiful man really sexy add that to the talent and most anything he's been in is a lot more tolerable he always gives his all even if some of the projects he's been involved in didn't quite hit the highest mark not the fault of the actor in most cases he's unfortunately been in some strange films that just didn't <UNK> at the box office always with a list actors but just not always a hit but he is worth every penny of any dvd rented or purchased see the wedding date with debra messing one of his best overall films worth every penny if you haven't seen it yet do then you'll understand that quote
<START> some movies are <UNK> but still fascinating pulp fiction others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly <UNK> and totally boring by the end i didn't care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre
<START> i saw the film and i got screwed because the film was foolish and boring i thought ram <UNK> <UNK> will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled sholay the cast and crew was bad the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle <UNK> <UNK> acting is poor i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure nobody did justice to their work including ajay <UNK> this film don't deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop br br finally this movie sucks
<START> my kids picked this out at the video store it's great to hear <UNK> as dorothy cause she sounds just like her mom but there are too many bad songs and the animation is pretty crude compared to other cartoons of that time
<START> ridiculous fluff that <UNK> its error by trying to have meaning joan this time as a <UNK> agatha reed <UNK> of a <UNK> dedicated to investigating the high cost of food says <UNK> reed the housewife has been getting it in the neck too long i'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the american family can take a vacation once a year see a movie every week and feed an occasional <UNK> to an elephant she's all business but becomes all <UNK> when she is awarded an <UNK> degree from good hope college where she was <UNK> for the crime of having stayed out all night the parallel to <UNK> real life is <UNK> here as it is in all joan movies the degree causes much <UNK> on campus that would make it the most broad minded institution in the history of education  but joan is unaware of this as she arrives the college president jim <UNK> played by robert young at his <UNK> happens to be <UNK> former teacher  and lover it was with him that she spent the night out all those years ago but joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married naturally this high profile event will be covered by life magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be yet another of <UNK> old lovers  this one she hung out with in china during the war and he thinks joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame eve <UNK> playing <UNK> assistant <UNK> is at her <UNK> and most smart <UNK> in this movie  with her <UNK> and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job if you didn't like her so much but you not only like eve in this as in all her roles you adore her she is so <UNK> and no nonsense you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys when joan cries upon arriving at her <UNK> <UNK> eve tells her it looks fierce but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she joan sees youth  herself at 18 eager <UNK>  a little frightened asking <UNK> is life what am i ' but of course if we actually go into depth about joan at 18 the truth may be a little different br br for me this is the major problem in watching any joan movie you can call her characters whatever you want to but it's always all joan all the time so since what we're always seeing is joan being herself it's easy to <UNK> with character's names it's just that it gets confusing when joan tries to tell us something <UNK> untrue like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 joan had already been around the block several times many men would have described her as eager and as far as being <UNK> she had already had several <UNK> at this point but that's a personal problem and i <UNK> but i simply wanted to explain why i say things such as <UNK> then joan <UNK> this or that or we see joan as when we are not literally watching a home movie br br there is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which joan is given the clara bow doll that she left behind in college  quick <UNK> tells us that joan and clara were <UNK> and this is a transparent <UNK> to make us believe joan is much younger than she actually looks it fails what also fails is an attempt at early 50s political correctness in the story joan has written a book about free speech and made a film no not the one about the <UNK> and she <UNK> the attention of an early 50s campus radical dr pitt who is about to be fired for his views which are shockingly similar to <UNK> this is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale <UNK> weak one to be sure but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from <UNK> into oblivion
<START> i have been a hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and <UNK> movie especially as a hindi film in the past several years i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movies and <UNK> to watching the classics <UNK> <UNK> mere <UNK> <UNK> mother india sholay etc but this movie changed everything it is one of the best movies i have ever seen i found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america it helped me to understand my own family history which was always something very abstract to me but to see it feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that indian people endured the film helped to put many things into perspective for me especially considering the current world events i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before it did the plot is fantastic the acting superb and the direction is flawless two thumbs up
<START> i didnt think it was possible but i have found film worse than <UNK> <UNK> this film is really really bad and what makes it worse is that its another australian film br br shot on what looks like vhs and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack it just keep getting worse and worse which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is skinned male hanging up side down in a white <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> room anyone br br and why do their accents keep changing from bad new york <UNK> to <UNK> english then pure aussie and it happens to the whole cast br br this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover i believe it was the <UNK> film festival this has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would <UNK> this for anything perhaps the golden <UNK> but i thinks its too bad for that <UNK> br br come on guys this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there br br well done to the film makers of this trash for proving there is a reason not to see films 0 10
<START> me and my sister saw the premiere last night it was so good we were glued for the whole thing <UNK> i think i'm hooked for the season they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist tho i cant wait till <UNK> finally jeremy <UNK> who is he i can tell hes going to be big he was <UNK> good we fell in love with his character right away cant wait for the next episode go jeremy br br <UNK>
<START> after reading the book i loved the story watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made it is understandable that books and movies <UNK> but it was two different stories only the names and some of the <UNK> story remained read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie the book gives you a better development of the characters these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them the locations were indeed in line with the <UNK> <UNK> some characters not included television has <UNK> so many great books and stories this is a perfect example of that <UNK> from the author doesn't always <UNK> a good movie but it can help sometimes

<START> although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching you better skip this one i watched this one on television so i didn't have to <UNK> down cash for it lucky me br br the plot develops slowly very slowly although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end it is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like lt waters would <UNK> direct orders and even if he would if the rest of his platoon would they know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our lt so let's do what he says despite the direct orders remember br br still there are some nice scenes in this movie they somewhat save a village where the total population is being <UNK> by the rebels well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed the strange part of it that they did take the <UNK> which the rebels left behind they rather go on foot maybe because the roads are <UNK> but there was no explanation for it anyway i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it br br what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves only near the end they loose a few <UNK> and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more can you believe that br br they fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves and they have rounds and round of <UNK> never run out of it <UNK> and <UNK> mines an <UNK> machine gun and even an <UNK> where do they get this stuff carrying it around or what they even got a <UNK> which shows them the activity of enemy rebels and this <UNK> has a <UNK> which goes on for days really who think up this crap br br i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating if not skip this one it saves you time
<START> this movie is an incredible piece of work it explores every <UNK> and <UNK> of the human mind focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them stellar performances all around this one had me <UNK> for about half an hour straight spend some real time with this one
<START> i appreciate movies like this smart and well crafted entertaining absorbing well acted and nicely directed nobody even pacino is chewing the scenery trying to stand out one of the film's most effective moments <UNK> pulling over at his beloved off <UNK> is chilling precisely because of its restraint br br not as good as say <UNK> show city hall is of a similar cloth engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart why such well <UNK> entertainment <UNK> at the box office is <UNK> guess br br you know pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because it's required great scene too
<START> eric <UNK> jack bruce and ginger baker re <UNK> to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called cream those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it all skinny very long hair wild clothes and loud music they played a combination of rock and blues and it was for the most part good stuff br br well these guys are now 60 something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us i was always extremely familiar with <UNK> of course who has never been out of the <UNK> but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades they surprised me when he was young baker was so <UNK> he looked like a speed freak near death now he looks healthy in shape and his drum playing was solid bruce looked a bit <UNK> but his voice is great as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing br br some people criticized this show for being low key i don't agree with that i have no complaints the concert sounded very good the second song <UNK> was outstanding the highlight of the concert for me br br highly recommended
<START> this film is really bad it maybe harsh but it is it really is poor script every vampire cliché in the book is used and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character i e <UNK> dracula there have been some truly brilliant dracula vampire movies in the past but this doesn't even make it into the dire <UNK> br br take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen slasher move add a <UNK> of dracula <UNK> and mix in a <UNK> <UNK> of religious surreal day dreaming and you get a confusing mess of a film dracula 2000 br br i really cannot find any good things to say about this movie as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent whats the problem with that i hear you cry well he is english but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent br br all in all you may as well say your money if you were thinking of buying it or rent it out watch it and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the <UNK> br br p s although la la is pretty frightening
<START> when we were in junior high school some of us boys would occasionally set off <UNK> it was considered funny then but the producers directors and cast of <UNK> santa angel of death in the dvd section of your local video rental are adults and they are still setting them off br br like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes br br mira sorvino hot in mighty <UNK> and other top rated films seems to have <UNK> herself to this project her acting is non existent confined mostly to <UNK> stares that are supposed to indicate how sensitive she is to the plight of the film's various victims br br but let me warn you do not be the next victim step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf <UNK> are not many good leg shots of mira the only high points i could find in the film and the supporting cast is of inferior quality delivering a <UNK> of badly done dialogue with embarrassing spanish accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production
<START> this is a beautiful film the true tale of bond between father and son this is by far tom hanks at his finest tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie he usually has the nice guy roles yet in this film he comes off in this film as a bit gritty but still emerges <UNK> like a rose even until the very last scene the assassination of his character the cast of this movie was well put together i also love the part when there is total silence when tom <UNK> character shoots and kills all of the men in mr <UNK> group there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene just simply emotion i love the look on john rooney paul <UNK> character's face when he realizes even before seeing him that it is tom <UNK> character getting revenge and he knows his fate has come the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies br br tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me
<START> this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is <UNK> <UNK> stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course it's night and it <UNK> and he has to do it alone yawn or the <UNK> of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow that's really original there are some nice bits though like the <UNK> scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent <UNK> do what they can that's definitely not worth it 3 out of 10
<START> it just seems bizarre that someone read this script and thought this is funny i mean it's so hilarious it just has to be made who was this person is he or she the person really responsible for this are they the one's who owe me for my time more so than the director writer br br this film stinks in most every way possible there's no one shred of good dialogue and not one likable character and the story br br i prefer the 2nd worst movie ever hulk <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> to this by quite a considerable degree it seems almost <UNK> in comparison br br the ending is padded out with several minutes of <UNK> and it's still under 80 minutes the <UNK> include cast members laughing at the <UNK> mistakes they've made and things that went wrong on the set of this <UNK> ' glad to see someone laughing in <UNK> with some connection to this <UNK> ' br br nothing in this film is funny nothing it just goes on and on it's truly that lame i love films that are so bad they're good this is so bad it's something but i don't know what and hopefully will never find out br br amanda <UNK> doesn't suck outright and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film but that really means little br br avoid at all costs
<START> i was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the <UNK> nights instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning even though i tried watching it twice br br it was a bonus that <UNK> was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked <UNK> for something a little similar zorro with anthony hopkins and <UNK> is much better for action comic moments and overall <UNK> br br ok so son of the dragon has many possible fans out there but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it if you just want the kids to settle down on a sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas
<START> tobe hooper is quite possibly the biggest <UNK> the horror genre has to offer like any other horror fan i loved the texas chainsaw but i think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title you should have at least more than one hit movie i can't really think of any other movie hooper has done on his own don't count <UNK> that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world and this movie night <UNK> just backs up my point br br poor robert englund i give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given he did what he could as for the movie itself pure <UNK> unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes a story that must have been penned in an our and really just awful scenery music and cinematography nothing in this film is <UNK> don't waste your time br br overall 1 out of 10 i feel sorry for hooper his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started i hope that he's able to <UNK> out at least one more good flick that way he can do his cult status some justice br br
<START> i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to previous animated series <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> most of which i love i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match <UNK> z as they started to <UNK> repeat the same pattern br br that very thing the novelty may be one of the best features of <UNK> z another good point is its <UNK> with so many <UNK> monsters strange devices and bizarre characters actually we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us
<START> there be very little doubt that <UNK> wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century jules <UNK> has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous <UNK> as plot devices wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard <UNK> consider it a near <UNK> there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed br br things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the <UNK> of writing novels and writing screenplays the <UNK> is often laden heavy handed and unconvincing one case in point is the two pilots from <UNK> sides discussing the nature of war why must we murder one another why this mirrors the criticism near naked contempt that <UNK> had of wells in his <UNK> wells hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti war message is painfully <UNK> it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an <UNK> pilot and his opposite number in the <UNK> a few years later br br that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from <UNK> <UNK> a world wide war taking place in 1940 that <UNK> the end of <UNK> there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child <UNK> a drum as a phantom army <UNK> in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the <UNK> sickness is wonderfully realised even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable and to be fair wells does ask the question the universe or nothing what shall it be in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive
<START> i always feel strange and guilty saying it because i'm a fairly well educated non teenager but i actually sort of like the olsen twins and i respect the movies they make even though i've never really been their target audience when in rome was a traditional mary kate and ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents <UNK> adult romance as a b storyline fashion <UNK> and even the gag reel over the credits i enjoyed myself when in rome and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they're not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next citizen kane or even an affair to remember my point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointed br br that said those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves for those of us who've watched them since the first episodes of full house it's really great to see them growing into more mature roles this movie provides important historical and <UNK> information just like many of their other movies remember 10 <UNK> street from winning london and the visit to the <UNK> from <UNK> to paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family br br as long as i still feel like i'm on my <UNK> and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins in order to be a fan of the olsen twins you don't have to be some pre teen valley girl from california in fact that's not really the target audience if it were the <UNK> a fashion line of clothes and <UNK> would be run through gap or some store like that not wal mart when in rome while it does feature high fashion and globe <UNK> and two girls from a valley in <UNK> isn't really about that it's more about inspiring young girls who have <UNK> to let it take them places if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on <UNK> so be it that's called marketing you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing at least they're sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br basically don't knock the film until you've seen it and then don't knock it until you've tried to understand what the olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative <UNK> and driven young women this movie does that i think just like their others kids enjoy parents do the same if you like the olsen twins you won't be disappointed
<START> people love the original story for its ending the hollywood style ending made this 99 version of 'a dog of <UNK> just for kids movie i didn't cry this time because the story was too hollywood japanese tv series are much better
<START> honestly i can't understand why this movie rates so well here nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest film i'm a huge fan of bakshi's earlier work particularly <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but frankly <UNK> 1977 was the last good film he made after that he turned to the mainstream beginning with the diabolical <UNK> of the <UNK> and then <UNK> down with sword and <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> br br what can i say the story is <UNK> the animation is tv quality i insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff and whereas <UNK> had real imagination <UNK> some gorgeous background art and an underground adult sensibility <UNK> and <UNK> is just designed for 14 year old boys and has the intellectual <UNK> of robinson <UNK> on mars br br yes if you liked the <UNK> books you might like this in my view though this was just another <UNK> in the slide in quality after <UNK> from which bakshi never <UNK> though he's done some decent tv stuff fairly recently br br 4 5 out of 10
<START> new york i love you is full of love and power not for everybody however but is a beautiful movie br br it has the likes of <UNK> <UNK> seen in transformers <UNK> <UNK> angels i robot indiana jones and many more maggie q kevin bacon blake lively natalie portman and many more with a star <UNK> cast this movie is without a doubt brilliant br br from many top notch directors around the world it does not fail to impress the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique br br it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie and should be watched on a big tv this time trust the imdb rating because it is an excellent film br br eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in <UNK> br br watch ny <UNK> you won't be disappointed
<START> who is bettie page i certainly didn't find out while watching this movie from what i have gathered from other sources ms page was highly in demand in the post world war ii period as the queen of naughty pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts i never did get to know bettie the woman though her childhood in <UNK> was a combination of an <UNK> christian upbringing and a <UNK> home life which is only hinted at the film <UNK> over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film the naughty pictures characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of bettie in her <UNK> <UNK> bettie in her <UNK> and <UNK> bettie in bondage etc the movie <UNK> from black and white to color every time ms page visits miami beach then back to her shades of gray life in new york we go gretchen mol portrays bettie as one of the most <UNK> young ladies you could ever meet when bettie <UNK> to a friend that she missed being her high school <UNK> by getting an a rather than an a one can only assume that there were only two students in her senior class the most interesting part of this movie is how quaint ms <UNK> naughty photos seem in 2007 it is truly sad that seeing a woman <UNK> up like a pig on a spit wouldn't even get a hit on my space or you tube i'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to <UNK> i would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd <UNK>
<START> bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress on the other hand starting in the 1980s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake <UNK> 10 that is if she hadn't allowed her husband john derek to take over her career numerous playboy <UNK> and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold john figured that putting bo in a movie <UNK> she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many <UNK> of <UNK> lord of the jungle a slap in the face to character's book and film legacy tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for <UNK> breasts and richard <UNK> wonderful over acting remember the pair had worked together in <UNK> his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a <UNK> <UNK> body can only get you so far miles <UNK> who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting <UNK> but bo and john derek never <UNK> from this fiasco and future <UNK> between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place br br and how did the <UNK> get to africa
<START> i had eagerly <UNK> the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas having reserved a special <UNK> for it last night i sat down to watch it with my daughter aged 17 and a film studies student with <UNK> of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin br br after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk the shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and <UNK> <UNK> we viewed on br br anne played by sally <UNK> looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions breaking our hard won <UNK> of the <UNK> and engaging us directly in an almost <UNK> find <UNK> stalking fashion br br poor rupert <UNK> jones who played captain <UNK> did his best with the script and direction bless him i hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> him and his co actor they were nearly swept out to sea health and safety would have had a field day poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place br br other than mr <UNK> jones alice <UNK> gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon <UNK> by those of anthony <UNK> unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott br br towards the long <UNK> end of the film captain <UNK> appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie it was as if he had developed a memory <UNK> which caused him to forget his very reason for being in contrast anne ran hyper <UNK> from <UNK> to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up a sweat br br we experienced none of <UNK> charms crossing the screen indeed we were left wondering what charismatic captain <UNK> had ever seen in plain <UNK> opinion less anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean <UNK> sir walter to just shut the heck up br br the crucial kiss normally our favourite <UNK> moment was painfully drawn out as they moved in closer anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing <UNK> before lips finally met <UNK> br br the most enjoyable thing about last night was the <UNK> and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been br br what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of <UNK> finest scenery br br sorry jane
<START> gentleman jim is another case of print the legend with errol flynn playing the legendary boxer as a <UNK> but charismatic social <UNK> in a <UNK> entertainment that barely stops for breath it's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in <UNK> the charge of the light <UNK> this is sheer <UNK> with all the stops pulled out filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by <UNK> <UNK> vivid direction flynn is still at the height of his powers you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production with <UNK> smith a beautiful romantic <UNK> partner and <UNK> sidekick alan hale along for good measure this time as <UNK> father jack carson takes sidekick duties this time indeed even the pirate <UNK> from <UNK> earlier movies makes a somewhat out of place cameo in a <UNK> bout the <UNK> minutes just <UNK> by
<START> one thing i can say about this movie is well long very long i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's even though i never lived in them is actually one of my favourite decades especially for the music when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive i will <UNK> the animation did impress me it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see but the movie honestly could of been a bit better it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had <UNK> fighting then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly in my opinion i thought it was extremely long i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie it made it seem like it was 4 hours long but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those nothing to do days i will see the new one and i hope it is better
<START> the stories in this video are very entertaining and it <UNK> is worth a look the first one concerns a young couple <UNK> in the woods by two <UNK> with a great but unexplained twist at the end br br the <UNK> is the best of the lot and it alone makes this worth watching a man is attacked by a dog which he fears to be <UNK> he finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital but he finds out the employees there are not exactly what they appear to be great twist at the end and this episode alone scores 10 10 if the others were up to par with this one this would get 10 10 br br the third is the weakest of the bunch a girl meets with some guys and has wild sex there appears to be no point to the story until the end with a good little twist but it is spoiled by the awful first part br br never the less this is a great movie that will not do you wrong at all well worth a rental
<START> although she is little known today deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s a pretty teenager with a <UNK> personality and a much admired operatic singing voice this <UNK> was her first major film and it proved a box office bonanza for <UNK> universal studios br br three smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long unseen father when their still faithful mother reveals he may soon <UNK> with the firm intention of <UNK> his gold <UNK> girlfriend and returning him to their mother although the story is slight the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality and such enjoyable character actors as charles <UNK> alice brady <UNK> watson and <UNK> <UNK> round out the cast a an ultra light amusement for fans of 1930s film br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> although the word <UNK> is used a lot to describe gene kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show in american in paris he <UNK> some outstanding numbers some which <UNK> the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at check out gene kelly's getting out of bed routine for starters br br gene kelly stars as a <UNK> who is based out of paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich woman's <UNK> but he really loves someone else <UNK> story sure but the musical numbers save the show here i really loved georges <UNK> voice work in this one his <UNK> to <UNK> and his <UNK> with le gene on 's <UNK> is 's <UNK> oscar <UNK> and leslie caron i can take or leave all in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie
<START> it's about time we see a movie that stays <UNK> towards these old indian traditions at times it is clear how most of the <UNK> are <UNK> even lying about how they don't charge their <UNK> while they are wearing their gold watches the <UNK> box is mandatory notice that there are only a couple of people who get <UNK> while we see quite a few cases br br keep in mind while watching that <UNK> <UNK> is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 <UNK> while the average <UNK> in india is 1 700 <UNK> month
<START> the first hour of the movie was boring as hell there is no suspense no action not even a plot the movie went no where i mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film overall the movie wasn't good at all and i don't recommend it
<START> cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run of the mill sci fi flick the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of <UNK> view of what's going on the close up camera view is how the director keeps the plot <UNK> the sci fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props br br the character development is intentionally shallow the main character jeremy northam decides to <UNK> himself into the world of espionage it's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the <UNK> that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
<START> this was a great movie even though there was only about 15 people including myself there it was great my friend and i laughed a lot my mom even enjoyed it there was two middle aged women there and a mid 20 year old there and they seemed to enjoy it i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol and when she gets her <UNK> and ned is there yeah this was a great movie even thought people <UNK> it lol go see it i bet you'll enjoy it i really enjoyed it and so did my friend br br people were so tough on this movie and they hadn't even seen it i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance they all did a great job in my opinion but if you have young kids its still appropriate i will probably take my 7 year old niece to watch it too
<START> we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan dom that i have never before approached one of the most intense thrills of non mainstream movie <UNK> at least as far as i am concerned is the pleasure of <UNK> the obscure i remember how as a teenager i <UNK> to see <UNK> revenge of the dead a k a night of the <UNK> which at that time had been <UNK> for a couple of decades likewise such <UNK> masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris <UNK> a night to <UNK> or half the works of jesus franco however recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once <UNK> <UNK> almost too accessible even for those of us on the <UNK> side of the atlantic br br and then behold there was i woke up early the day i died a movie that should have been so <UNK> yet which disappeared into the <UNK> even before <UNK> <UNK> the first fairly lengthy article on it that first <UNK> my <UNK> the 1990s needed a hard to find movie though which would really be worth hunting out and this to be sure is it i don't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film its classy yet <UNK> cast its haunting yet often <UNK> visuals its wondrous moments of pure cinema in the sense of the 1920s french <UNK> and <UNK> or even its <UNK> memorable soundtrack since this has all been described most <UNK> by other users here br br what i do wish to mention briefly is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure <UNK> relating to this almost lost to us but thankfully not quite movie i think the german video which i picked up while in <UNK> on a cold crisp <UNK> day is fairly well known to ed <UNK> followers now it is also quite common knowledge that a <UNK> poster for the film was released however there is thankfully more to be found firstly there are a number of reviews available from the film's german theatrical release i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to <UNK> my students some of these reviews are positive <UNK> to the film's artistry and entertainment value and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it <UNK> within both the american trash and european <UNK> traditions secondly there is the score by larry <UNK> which can be acquired from the man himself many of the tracks <UNK> a truly emotional pull on the <UNK> particularly if you are <UNK> the film's currently <UNK> status and growing a little melancholy at the same time finally for now i wish to mention the <UNK> soundtrack that <UNK> put out in extremely limited numbers beg borrow steal kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to <UNK> one of these it features 14 tracks from the film including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the late <UNK> <UNK> jesus i was evil two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand although that is another story again the cool radio music to which christina <UNK> dances and also those amazing <UNK> drops by <UNK> and <UNK> the latter being billy <UNK> very own <UNK> band br br become obsessed let ed wood rule your life
<START> there is no possible reason i can <UNK> why this movie was ever made br br why must hollywood continue to <UNK> out one horrible update of a classic after another cases in point mister <UNK> the <UNK> awful br br christopher lloyd whom i normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so <UNK> <UNK> to be almost criminal his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character br br the director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants br br fault must lie with the <UNK> <UNK> script i think the writer used it's a mad mad mad mad world as an example of a fine comedy script as manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this <UNK> in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison br br what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children i just am not sure whose children it was made for certainly no self <UNK> card carrying child i know br br if they had to remake my favorite martian why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic br br unfortunately imdb com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty br br one good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid i think
<START> i love special effects and witnessing new <UNK> that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it's been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i'm usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i'm not sure why perhaps it's that i don't want kevin bacon to be evil and there's disappointment in that but i think it's witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 perhaps 12 if they are mature
<START> <UNK> more enjoyable for me than a who <UNK> it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end and that's precisely what happens in deathtrap based on a chilling play by ira <UNK> rosemary's baby br br and in it michael caine and christopher reeve get to do the kind of stunt that caine and laurence olivier pulled off in sleuth with just about as much skill and as many <UNK> as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play br br but because it's meant to scare you surprise you and keep you guessing as to the outcome it's difficult to write a review about the plot let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present michael caine is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably when a young aspiring writer christopher reeve sends him the <UNK> of his play caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back br br from that point on it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as ira <UNK> story <UNK> managing to <UNK> agatha christie for the number of twists br br caine and reeve play off each other brilliantly each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that <UNK> drama with humor br br <UNK> up well worth seeing but not everyone is pleased with the ending
<START> <UNK> is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our <UNK> our <UNK> our fears it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the <UNK> of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century the movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced one of happiness and excitement sadness and grief the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in <UNK> <UNK> where it takes place hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to <UNK> and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the <UNK> sound of an old radio playing radio <UNK> international playing their dreams our dreams <UNK> will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours
<START> i think this film has much to recommend it particularly an especially sinister performance by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very very hard to follow in some cases all in all it makes for a nice time in front of the tube
<START> like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies if you asked me to name a good gangster movie i'd have dozens to choose from if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you the last time that film is the general unrelated to the <UNK> silent film of the same name this is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it's more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy <UNK> br br like <UNK> 1990 and american gangster 2007 <UNK> superior mob <UNK> the general is based on real people and true events the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin <UNK> brendan <UNK> who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing <UNK> and houses as an adult meanwhile the police led by an inspector named kenny jon voight try desperately and <UNK> to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him br br perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous <UNK> 1990 and the first two godfather films i was expecting too much from the general but that may be going too easy on it this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being <UNK> by boredom in this <UNK> and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented for some reason director john <UNK> and cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full <UNK> color film now i have nothing against b w pictures not even ones made in modern day times <UNK> list 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and it's a masterpiece the general made just five years after <UNK> list is not the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that i found simply annoying the filmmakers were obviously going for a <UNK> documentary like style like <UNK> list did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classic style motion picture performances in the film range from passable to poor brendan <UNK> and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were <UNK> the sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime noir appeal but that also fails because again it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place br br but the worst thing that occurs is that there's not <UNK> <UNK> in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for in fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was <UNK> what moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time <UNK> here i did not sympathize or hate the brendan <UNK> character because the way the <UNK> character is written is simply flat and dull <UNK> just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin <UNK> obviously did if a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing no <UNK> no relief no surprise nothing we just say so what and that's all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorly made crime film
<START> 2 stars and i'm being generous minor spoilers look this is a low budget zombie movie set in <UNK> <UNK> as the plot goes a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive by br br the main problem with this movie what zombies all the zombies do is <UNK> which doesn't sound even remotely scary and <UNK> fake red blood from their mouths no scary eyes no <UNK> flesh just a bunch of people <UNK> <UNK> and running around like idiots br br the cover is also misleading there are only about 6 zombies in the whole film so it's not like the whole hood is plagued with zombies or anything it's just a few and is contained in no time br br the acting actually is so bad it's hilarious no one can act at all in this movie except maybe one of the gang members and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together decided to cast their family and made a movie one weekend br br final note since when do doctors wear <UNK> skip this one please
<START> this <UNK> entry is lacking in continuity most of them have their elements of silliness the <UNK> wedding and so on however this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another the house seems more like a city there's also leo g <UNK> who is such an obvious suspect who no one seems to even look at he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but <UNK> and the folks don't seem to pick up on anything still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending br br i know that <UNK> is supposed to be a comic figure but like <UNK> bruce in the <UNK> sherlock holmes flicks he is so <UNK> that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him is there a history behind him that will explain how he and <UNK> became associates
<START> well cube 1997 <UNK> first movie was one of the most interesting and <UNK> ideas that i've ever seen when talking about movies they had just one scenery a bunch of actors and a plot so what made it so special were all the effective direction great dialogs and a bizarre condition that characters had to deal like rats in a <UNK> his second movie cypher 2002 was all about its story but it wasn't so good as cube but here are the characters being tested like rats again br br nothing is something very interesting and gets vincenzo coming back to his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the characters once again in a very different space with no time once more playing with the characters like playing with rats in an experience room but instead of a thriller sci fi even some of the <UNK> <UNK> and trailers <UNK> seemed like that nothing is a loose and light comedy that for sure can be called a modern satire about our society and also about the <UNK> world we're living once again <UNK> <UNK> us with a great idea into a so small kind of thing 2 actors and a <UNK> white scenario that's all you got most part of time and you don't need more than that while cube is a claustrophobic experience and cypher confusing nothing is completely the opposite but at the same time also desperate br br this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget of course that the movie fails sometimes but its prime idea means a lot and <UNK> any flaws there's nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that i had in movies since cube
<START> generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer extended maybe to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take <UNK> off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to <UNK> brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it
<START> there isn't one decent scene br br amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time proof that you a can start anywhere the guy playing sebastian sucks too he doesn't even look much like ryan <UNK> more like joshua jackson the two other girls are terrible as well br br then the dialogue is also crap br br sebastian about to have <UNK> if you cant beat them br br virgin girl who says you can't beat 'em br br lame br br the ending <UNK> the entire plot of the original in the first film it is clearly stated that kathryn and sebastian never had sex one of the reasons sebastian wanted kathryn so bad aside from the fact that she's played by sarah michelle <UNK> was that she was the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him she was a <UNK> who liked playing with him the fact that she never gave it to him <UNK> his wanting then in this p o s it implies that he can have her along with a girl on the side what and we don't even see the sex either it's implied making it not only stupid pointless and <UNK> but worthless too br br and in the first one kathryn rejects sebastian because he fell in love making him a loser even though he won the bet that <UNK> his chances then in this <UNK> he <UNK> and falls in love so she doesn't screw losers only complete losers another thing it's stated that sebastian has never been in love so what do you call the thing with virgin girl br br then at the end virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be <UNK> evil lesbian lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and like i said they go into a lame <UNK> <UNK> stupid br br there's several other plot <UNK> did the writer even see the first film a 5 year old can point his stuff out br br after the <UNK> sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin <UNK> her innocent mind in the back of a <UNK> while kathryn and virgin girl turned evil lesbian in lame sudden plot twist sit in the front listen and smile <UNK> into the camera br br the end br br seeing sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film i guess all it took to make little sebastian bad was a <UNK> with two hot girls interesting
<START> one of the best of the fred astaire and <UNK> rogers films great music by irving berlin solid support from randolph scott harriet nelson lucille ball betty <UNK> frank <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br terrific songs include let yourself go let's face the music and putting all my eggs in one basket the last song is introduced by astaire playing a <UNK> piano and then a cute dance with rogers rogers also sings let yourself go with <UNK> among the <UNK> singers br br harriet nelson then <UNK> sings two nice songs and plays <UNK> <UNK> sister get <UNK> behind me is a song that sticks with you for days she also sings but where are you snappy and fast paced this entry in the astaire rogers series is one of the better ones the classic and amazing beautiful finale let's face the music and dance is among the best known of their numbers rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history a <UNK> <UNK> number that <UNK> around her legs as she dances <UNK> <UNK> and is also slightly see through just gorgeous this is the number that steve martin and <UNK> peters re created in <UNK> from heaven br br randolph scott seems an odd choice as <UNK> pal but he also appeared in their <UNK> with irene dunne luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance it seems that <UNK> and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact <UNK> has the bigger role but is only ok br br rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with let yourself go <UNK> and <UNK> it's a great song br br fun all the way although i got tired of we joined the navy after the third time
<START> grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in <UNK> as <UNK> jr and sr <UNK> and performed while <UNK> of their past their existence in a <UNK> mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget
<START> this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese ben affleck was seriously not trying to act in any way shape or form he outright sucked nothing about the movie was believable the first problems were in the intro where the man gives everything of value to the salvation army santa claus but it doesn't show why and then the <UNK> sticks her head in the <UNK> really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie it's not even in the same tone as the movie there was no explanation of the motivation for ben affleck to choose the house he chose there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose and people are <UNK> here and there without any cause to be <UNK> example christina <UNK> and ben <UNK> characters go <UNK> down a <UNK> <UNK> this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him <UNK> anyway there was a funny moment or two but they were a <UNK> in the movie it seriously needed another rewrite or 4 hope you enjoy
<START> i feel totally ripped off someone needs to <UNK> the 4 95 i spent at blockbuster to rent this <UNK> mess this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first place somebody must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view shot on <UNK> <UNK> said the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section want to see a good musical then don't rent this movie
<START> i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary it was heart breaking disturbing and inspiring all in one i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives or simply something that will make you think you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us his life and struggles will make you cry laugh and find that life's a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time
<START> <UNK> <UNK> china o'brien manhattan chase 2000 made this film enjoyable to watch and of course e this cute <UNK> gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body china o'brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it <UNK> and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad who is the local sheriff her dad is getting older and the town has changed gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to hell well you almost can guess what happens and you are right china o'brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life bad acting through out the picture but <UNK> <UNK> brings this film to a wonderful conclusion
<START> not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two <UNK> are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip off of <UNK> however the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me br br i'm not someone easily shocked by what film makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor br br i think most people when watching just the first ten minutes of <UNK> and <UNK> will find themselves reaching for the remote
<START> i knew absolutely nothing about <UNK> before my viewing of it i didn't know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the film's history all i knew was it was a highly acclaimed french film had i known more i probably wouldn't have viewed the picture with an open mind on paper the premise doesn't sound interesting to me had i known what <UNK> was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited however not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it throughout i had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be it was if nothing else not a predictable film indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks telling a story in flashbacks is often a <UNK> move on the part of the filmmakers since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive by using the flashback technique director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to <UNK> without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that <UNK> is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside a lesser filmmaker would give france a <UNK> looking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood instead denis presents france as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside br br it could be <UNK> that <UNK> is more about <UNK> mother since she is given far more screen time though i believe it is ultimately about france to me what <UNK> is really about is how a mother's actions affect her daughter it is about how parents' behavior stays with their <UNK> france is not ruined by her mother's actions in the story yet her mother's actions clearly made an impression on france had france not been affected at all by her mother's actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant br br for a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present <UNK> was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place the film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story with a well told story solid editing and organized directing <UNK> is one of the better french films i have seen it was responsible for <UNK> claire <UNK> career and with good reason it's an incredible directorial debut
<START> life is really too short for movies like this i knew it couldn't be good when i realized what i'd already suspected that david <UNK> would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in <UNK> br br let's face it either the guy can't play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts i have a feeling that it's a mixture of both br br and i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow barbara <UNK> toni collette and carol kane
<START> although this is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie it does have some highlights the settings are quite beautiful and the pacing of the adventure is good you won't be bored watching it br br keith is as <UNK> as possible playing the eponymous lead an <UNK> drunk jungle guide <UNK> into <UNK> rich boy van hoffman and his gorgeous wife shower on a hunting expedition in cannibal country he never takes things seriously shower is there as decoration and keith makes extensive use of her she doesn't really have to act much she's not the only female to show off her body and the <UNK> aspects of the film make it about halfway to a t a picture br br there's nothing in this film that would draw specific attention to it or away from it produced to be <UNK> it succeeds without too much fuss a good 2 am cable <UNK>
<START> <UNK> role as the <UNK> brings to mind bob barker of the price is right running a country the same way he runs his show but there's lots more to chuckle and <UNK> through in this turkey kurt thomas as the baby faced hero displays some considerable <UNK> skills but not a <UNK> of acting talent whatsoever there's a few spooky moments in the village of <UNK> mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences but any given ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing
<START> its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and <UNK> take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of film maker rubbish <UNK> in a few extra styles for good measure chopped off the ending there you have revolver br br yes i did think about it for a little bit after watching and yes it did kind of make sense however that doesn't stop it being garbage br br waste of money waste of time br br up there as the worst movie i have ever seen with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little
<START> i saw this in the early 70s when i was 16 and despite the long slow set up <UNK> <UNK> etc once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it still do it has aged very well back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative happily i'm no longer in such a minority br br it <UNK> shows in a somewhat <UNK> way the political <UNK> <UNK> confrontation brutal <UNK> <UNK> and deception which lay ahead br br appreciation for this <UNK> film has grown and i'm glad about that
<START> this musical was not quite what i expected foremost being there weren't many scenes between brando and sinatra as it was based on a damon <UNK> story i expected irony and surprise of which there was one really good one when we find that sinatra's gang has used the salvation army office for their crap game while brando was in <UNK> with simmons if course it comes at the right moment too when brando brings her back i really didn't expect much from brando as a singer but he surprised me he wasn't great but he was just fine in the role his big number in the <UNK> however with the rest of sinatra's boys was the only place i felt <UNK> voice was weak he just didn't have the power the grand climax <UNK> overall i found the scenes between brando and simmons to be filled with electricity something i didn't think would happen when we first see simmons by herself and later when we're introduced to brando in the restaurant with sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him it wasn't until brando goes to her office that the story came to life br br frank sinatra on the other hand was flat even his vocal performances and vivian <UNK> who i never heard of but who i guess played the role on broadway just seemed to slow the proceedings down the scenes between her and sinatra were obvious also her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of <UNK> story or character on top of that all the <UNK> girls numbers seemed shoe <UNK> in just there for <UNK> for example when frank meets with brando in the nightclub we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there hadn't been any dance number at all whenever brando and simmons were on screen i was having a great time but each time we return to the sinatra <UNK> story my interest level <UNK> br br as for the songs there were some good ones particularly the very first number with <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> for <UNK> number can do that's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in the music man cash for the <UNK> whatever it's called and the number in the <UNK> i couldn't help but be reminded of cool from west side story which brings me to a point i really did not like the art direction in this film the fake times square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself same for the <UNK> sequence and particularly the <UNK> i realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets but things were changing <UNK> for example made great use of location photography even on the town shot scenes in <UNK> in 1949 by the time we get to west side story in <UNK> it's a given that stuff taking place in manhattan had to be actually shot in manhattan so by comparison guys and dolls set bound manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute and changing <UNK> to <UNK> did they really have to do that for legal reasons now i always thought guys and dolls was a musical about sinatra and brando and their adventures with various girls it was much more focused than that which is to its credit in that regard it is much better than les girls which was interesting in it's own right but had a certain <UNK> to it br br my one major complaint about guys and dolls and i don't know if this is <UNK> to the original stage show but when jean simmons realizes that brando never took any money for a bet that he made with sinatra and even said that he lost the bet she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding it seems to me a scene between brando and simmons would have added to the impact of the story to see brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene there is such a scene in the music man spoilers ahead when harold and marion have that <UNK> while he's waiting for her to change she's upstairs in her house he's down on the sidewalk he's singing <UNK> <UNK> she's singing <UNK> my someone they suddenly switch and sing each other's songs a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other it's an emotional high moment of the film still guys and dolls had a lot going for it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  yellow is a lot of fun like at least one other reviewer i was on numerous occasions laughing out loud yellow is energetic playful self aware <UNK> don't expect bergman here this movie is about a youth in the early to mid 60s in sweden and about the issues read <UNK> that the nation and the world were facing at times yellow appears to be an earnest social political documentary with lena the main character and others <UNK> both common people and politicians e g <UNK> <UNK> at home at other times yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary all the while yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring <UNK> life her home life her loves her political views her view of herself she is a complete person  complex flawed <UNK> happy sad curious and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director <UNK> and his crew <UNK> themselves <UNK> lena it is this that for me really gives yellow wings not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways reminding the viewer that this is fiction and <UNK> but their presence is itself another <UNK> of the film they are filming themselves filming themselves i am reminded of a <UNK> music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video ad <UNK> with each <UNK> getting <UNK> and more cartoonish i think <UNK> may have had something similar in mind while <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  yellow may not be everyone's cup of tea it is certainly intelligent witty refreshing <UNK> and authentic
<START> a <UNK> is on the side of the road making sure <UNK> is <UNK> the speed limit doing his job he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother there is a child in the back seat he then is telling her what is wrong and <UNK> they get killed okay this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie when i was watching this movie in the theatre i was with some friends this was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie we all decided to see a suspense thriller that looked good to everyone in the group this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life not only did i waste 7 <UNK> on a movie ticket but i had to sit through torture for the brain this movie started off with mystery and suspense and i seriously thought this cant be bad i was so wrong the whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense even if you can get passed the bad acting the not so scary storyline and the over all horrible mess this movie was you will still be puzzled it's not because you're not smart enough to understand it it's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about right now you may be thinking oh man i have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says it is get that thought out of your head right now i'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it please people don't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential it doesn't i give this movie 1 out of 10 if i could give a zero i would and i do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie you'll be saving yourself many <UNK> nights trying to think w t f that freaking movie is about
<START> this movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects it is very weak on plot most of the computer talk was just <UNK> <UNK> i watched this because i was a big fan of the original war games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer <UNK> this movie had none of that most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks but just lame it is like it was written by somebody who has no <UNK> of real computers br br the <UNK> game was lame and was essentially just an <UNK> game no real <UNK> so what was the point movie was boring lame sequel
<START> i was very fond of this film it kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen one of the better movies about the <UNK> that i have seen <UNK> <UNK> is gorgeous too this is one of the most personal and down to earth films i've seen on the <UNK> it's a little less mainstream than <UNK> and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on and come out completely one the other side this isn't typical bollywood fare but rather an art house type film the best part of this movie is that it doesn't <UNK> one side of the <UNK> conflict when focusing on the story of another it doesn't blame or <UNK> but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things
<START> before sunrise is a wonderful love story and has to be among my top 5 favorite movies ever dialog and acting are great i love the characters and their ideas and thoughts of course the romantic vienna introduced in the movie does not exist you won't find a poet sitting by the river in the middle of the night and it isn't possible to get to all the places in only one night either especially if you're a stranger and it's your first night in vienna but that's not the point the relationship of the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not at all unrealistic although nothing ever really happens the movie never gets boring the ending is genuinely sad without being titanic or something even if you don't like love stories you should watch this film i'm a little <UNK> about the sequel that is going to be released in summer the first part is perfect as it is in my opinion
<START> though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of blood br br there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing acting editing and script writing br br jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i've ever seen his descent into the <UNK> of madness is <UNK> self aware and clumsy oh look at him <UNK> oh look at him drink strong spirits oh look at him raise his brow and <UNK> his head at a <UNK> angle oh look at his <UNK> <UNK> dark hair oh listen to his <UNK> <UNK> voice he must be a tortured artist writer genius oh yes out comes the poet shirt it's another boy who thinks he's byron or poe oh for the love of did someone give this guy a <UNK> on how to act good or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere the <UNK> little plastic toy prize in a <UNK> brand of bargain bin <UNK> okay that was a stupid line but that's only because <UNK> performance has <UNK> my brain with its awfulness br br <UNK> <UNK> is cute and very <UNK> rose but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film she delivered her lines like she was being held up in fact her whole performance was very wooden her poses as stiff as her lines who knows perhaps she was just <UNK> to and trying to <UNK> jeremy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but if that's the case she takes it too far br br notable is <UNK> <UNK> as poe while his character's role is confused he delivers the best performance of the piece he quite simply looks right but it's more than that he has some sort of depth i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two dimensional quality of the rest of the characters huh maybe it's just because i like poe and could thus just let my mind wander and <UNK> while he was on screen whatever he had an interest factor otherwise missing br br the rest of the characters are a <UNK> <UNK> there are all the usual caricatures the <UNK> blonde best friend who's a bit of a <UNK> the smitten local cop who's a bit of a <UNK> the protective older man who perhaps has too much un <UNK> interest in our heroine the scheming old witch etc etc yawn yawn br br as with the <UNK> lack of blood for a horror <UNK> issue none of the themes that they mention and that <UNK> character mentions so <UNK> in his attack on <UNK> writing are followed through on as another reviewer said there was potential here murder incest genuinely shocking stuff but instead they <UNK> away from the issues and cut away from the violence a raised <UNK> swinging through the air closing in on it's victim then cut to black this is fine in a <UNK> traditional horror indeed it's expected and is <UNK> received when it happens it's a dear convention especially when accompanied by fake lightning <UNK> and intense <UNK> eye makeup but in <UNK> it just comes across as clumsy or as though the editor got <UNK> at the last minute and cut it out this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller the horror of <UNK> <UNK> madness or a simple and fun slasher movie it tries to be both or neither something new and exciting but either way it fails <UNK> the only horror element of this entire movie is it's epic <UNK> br br i think the editor if there was one at all must have been drunk when s he chopped this thing up there are <UNK> <UNK> scenes scenes that appeared to be out of order but that could have just been the poor script likewise the director cinematographer there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be <UNK> to hitchcock or <UNK> but just ended up looking silly again fine in a noir but this was trying to be something else br br the whole thing perhaps may have been funny in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned <UNK> how did this get made if i had been in the mood for some trash <UNK> unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch with the lights down low with the express intention of <UNK> myself silly this is a very poor film and i'm afraid i can't recommend it to people not even for laughs br br please please don't waste your time or money on this either borrow a real horror thriller film or find yourself a copy of <UNK> <UNK> tales either way you'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish
<START> quote <UNK> anyone with an i q over 50 would have seen this film what it is an intelligent well acted prequel to a modern day classic yes it doesn't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget but it is still very well done and had me hooked for the full duration br br an i q over 50 you say that most mean you have an i q lower than 50 its name is <UNK> way rise to power meaning it should have something <UNK> the first one to do br br all and all its a ok movie if you change the title and no characters named carlito <UNK> br br p s don't comment on a movie if you don't know anything about movies but i guess an i q under 50 you wont know what the hell i am yelling about br br peace out
<START> this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film along the lines of tales from the crypt written by robert <UNK> author of psycho it's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee the third doctor has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star
<START> like some of the other reviewers have <UNK> to previously i'd like to know what moron actually read the script and <UNK> <UNK> this is it this is the next film we are going to green light and whoever that person is should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity because whoever is responsible for actually <UNK> out money to have this made after reading the script well i'd love to give you my email address and maybe you'd like to just give away some more money this film is atrocious in every way br br the wayans are funny at least they can be they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way but in here not only does the premise defy all logic not only is the acting terrible not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find but they actually want you to pay to see this film maybe if it was free <UNK> it would still be a waste of time br br usually i'd be inclined to write some long <UNK> detailed review about why this film is so bad but just suffice to say that let my <UNK> do the talking this is the lowest common <UNK> film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack br br 0 10 makes my top ten list of worst films of all time
<START> the first review i saw of page 3 said what is <UNK> <UNK> finally wants to say should he say something so <UNK> br br the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn't take sides no propaganda whatsoever this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue i don't know what do i call as an issue here and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started br br the movie <UNK> so many characters who are completely with completely different <UNK> and different <UNK> and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more <UNK> i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times
<START> i have read over 100 of the nancy drew books and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet nancy drew the movie was of a younger nancy drew not the 18 year old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about this was when she was sixteen so naturally she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the <UNK> grade other than that i thought the movie was very cute it was clean and appropriate for everyone it was funny at times i thought emma roberts did a great job she was <UNK> in character and cute i liked the <UNK> that nancy and ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books it was a cute pg movie that i <UNK> enjoyed because i unlike most people my age enjoy movies without sex drugs or profanity
<START> i happen to have bought one of those legacy of horror 50 movie pack <UNK> and would you believe i'm still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil's <UNK> or the devil bat or one of the great alfred hitchcock's films some aren't horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter br br so we open up to sort of a <UNK> game idea the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates carradine gives a good enough performance as always but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre terrible performances the rest of the cast either overacts or <UNK> in scenes given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited it's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes some actors like the servants <UNK> and <UNK> give an effort at least and i'm ashamed to admit kind of left me <UNK> at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who done it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film you aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack chilling containing films like house on a haunted hill little shop of <UNK> with jack nicholson and night of the living dead over it this is best avoided
<START> richard <UNK> is a big not very nice <UNK> who has nearly worked himself to death if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life well he'll likely be better off if he <UNK> the voice of the <UNK> br br this william castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of richard <UNK> life through <UNK> a la citizen kane and some intriguing plotting in the final <UNK> <UNK> performance is generally pretty good but unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do also the movie <UNK> from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful 30s movie like <UNK> full of nice urban ethnic types who don't mind that they aren't rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so br br this is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role
<START> having seen most of <UNK> <UNK> films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual it's a ancient china period piece <UNK> full of kick ass martial arts where the location of an underground <UNK> full of traps and <UNK> plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is <UNK> memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your <UNK> on even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do if you can find it don't pass it up
<START> as i watched this movie and i began to see its' characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture when you get that feeling and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare i had that very feeling throughout this movie robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on i can say without any <UNK> at all see this movie it will not disappoint
<START> jonathan rivers michael keaton suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies soon after he's approached by a dr price an expert in electronic voice <UNK> <UNK> who claims he's been receiving messages from <UNK> <UNK> wife anna via <UNK> electronic <UNK> is anna trying to tell jonathan something is this merely a hint of something on a larger <UNK> or <UNK> scale it's good to see keaton in a leading role but the story he's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points it's as if the movie doesn't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up so it just <UNK> the viewer with new unrelated questions br br keaton himself is pretty good convincingly cast as the <UNK> widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife he's <UNK> quite a bit as an actor leaving behind the frat friendly <UNK> <UNK> roles he played 15 or so years earlier he looks a little <UNK> with a perhaps few more <UNK> than one might expect but he's lost none of the <UNK> and <UNK> that he's shown during his quarter century in hollywood br br so it's not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance it's that the script itself is <UNK> written by <UNK> johnson the plot gets more confusing as it progresses each <UNK> path ending in another <UNK> path this is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement something that ties more or less everything together and explains something but not white noise i knew less about what had happened to jonathan than i did before i'd first seen him br br keaton's really the only reason to watch this junk although he gets fine support from ian <UNK> as dr price and deborah <UNK> <UNK> as the requisite love interest
<START> as part of our late 1950s <UNK> we well knew the <UNK> little joe <UNK> ben <UNK> etc on that great show bonanza br br it came saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set this was a real show depicting family values there may have been a weekly crisis but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together br br <UNK> greene was <UNK> as the <UNK> of the family his words depicted wisdom we often were left to wonder that ben <UNK> a widower must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died he <UNK> wonderful sons br br naturally we all wondered why <UNK> roberts left the show the show was a gold mine and roberts <UNK> loads of money when he <UNK> his career never took off as he was associated as a <UNK> son he should have tried to get back into the series he certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out
<START> i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson brenda <UNK> big tony <UNK> tony <UNK> and matthew <UNK> also jay o sanders and <UNK> <UNK> the film has great special effects and acting from all of the film's actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by composer randy <UNK> is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities <UNK> jackson's ray mitchell character reminded me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character reminded me of steve <UNK> and jay o <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion <UNK> how al <UNK> looks today this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film
<START> when the local sheriff is killed his wife takes over until and is determined to clean up the town not everyone in town however is happy with what she's doing when the sheriff orders a <UNK> in town the local saloon owner also a woman hires a killer to take care of the sheriff there's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love br br <UNK> is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution there's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out in more capable hands or with a larger budget <UNK> might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west as it is <UNK> is a sloppy mess of a movie br br there are just so many things wrong with the movie a supporting cast with no acting ability stilted and unnatural dialogue and sets that look like sets but the biggest <UNK> is the editing i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors and horses for that matter obviously waiting for corman to yell action the best is the scene of two riders on <UNK> just standing beside a building all of a sudden they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles or take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to <UNK> his horse br br it's not as if corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with while none were great stars beverly garland john ireland and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance but in <UNK> they're not given much to work with br br i have now seen both the mst3k and non mst3k versions of the movie i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route
<START> this is a great film if this is any indication than hong sang <UNK> really is asian <UNK> best kept secret it's very similar in style to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and covers a lot of the same ground as them <UNK> but i think i actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films the overt <UNK> is slightly less <UNK> here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow i found the film less self <UNK> slow than <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which i think is part of the reason i enjoyed it more plus it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as <UNK> does i felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less open ended just barely than some of their work although that's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward moving plot i would have a hard time believing that sophia coppola wasn't directly influenced by this film for lost in translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and <UNK> in her hotel room wearing punk <UNK> can't help but seem familiar
<START> so i finally saw the film my left foot last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is the central performance of day lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less br br the fatal <UNK> in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the <UNK> of this man the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk on the one hand i can see that this is a logical <UNK> mankind always has the capacity to be <UNK> and <UNK> shouldn't obscure that i just wish that <UNK> <UNK> wouldn't be so <UNK> of <UNK> behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable they don't acting out is normal and so yes disabled people act out but they don't do it because they're disabled they do it because they're being <UNK> a physical <UNK> doesn't afford you the right to throw a <UNK> fit in public just because someone you love turns you down br br there are certain things it is <UNK> to do whether you are disabled or able <UNK> giving someone <UNK> <UNK> to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them admittedly i did once save a penalty from the <UNK> star <UNK> with my face but i already <UNK> by then it wasn't for acceptance engaging in a bar <UNK> is another <UNK> in the fact that your father only <UNK> <UNK> to you after you've proved yourself capable of <UNK> jumping through physical <UNK> takes <UNK> a step too far all of these things are stupid and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn't make them any less <UNK> br br so yes just because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn't make you any less of a jerk being a good person takes <UNK> setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list
<START> i have been learning about the zodiac for four years now and i'm not saying i know much more than anyone else in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about z i am <UNK> the one with the least knowledge but i do know or at least i think i know that most of the stuff in this wouldn't happen from how he signed his name to how he killed people i thought that godfather was the worst film ever br br the cinematography was that of a five year old not saying that my films are any better but i am not someone who is making movies for the mass population br br the acting i thought for the most part was pretty good really i did the lead didn't talk that much on camera or at all i forget and don't know because i stopped watching his voice overs where good br br but really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else like a large pizza or something br br until i learn how to write a review psycho phil
<START> years ago when i was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay and while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to i couldn't resist a free trip to the movies that's how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch in a brain dead sort of way and technically the stunts and camera work are good so this <UNK> my rating all the way to a 2 so why is the movie so bad well unlike the first rambo movie this one has virtually no plot rambo himself only says about 3 words other than <UNK> and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect and what <UNK> awful special effects while <UNK> bullets and rockets are shot at rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark and while the bad guys are using <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and rockets in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and <UNK> with what seem like nuclear powered <UNK> the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and <UNK> <UNK> one of these exploding <UNK> is particularly made for dumb viewers it was wonderfully <UNK> in <UNK> starring weird al plus hot shots part <UNK> also does a funny parody of the genre not just this stupid scene br br all in all a movie so dumb and pointless it's almost like self parody
<START> brilliant use of <UNK> technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day christmas <UNK> the <UNK> element during the scenes santa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> behavior <UNK> through a <UNK> is unique and obviously jean luc godard although he was subtle stole this theme in his film <UNK> le <UNK> highly recommended
<START> when people think of downtown chicago they think of walter <UNK> <UNK> and da bears <UNK> <UNK> the white sox breaking the curse in 2005 or the immortal michael jordan and his six <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with the chicago <UNK> rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago the <UNK> the drug <UNK> streets and life in the urban <UNK> projects during the 1970's br br one of <UNK> most <UNK> shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was good times which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs and i enjoy regularly now on tv land br br good times was another norman <UNK> classic the producer that gave us the <UNK> the best african american sitcom of all time and all in the family the greatest show of all time good times brought out the <UNK> of the ghetto and the urban <UNK> projects and did so with charm well written and thoughtful plots and some wonderful acting especially by the <UNK> and <UNK> of this struggling ghetto family played by esther <UNK> and john <UNK> the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet br br the <UNK> of the children j j played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief his emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early <UNK> j j gets annoying and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans <UNK> that he never tells j j to get his own life get a job and get out of the house j j is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above <UNK> status br br two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of <UNK> and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can't afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn't want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she <UNK> has to the other episode is the one where james evans can't afford the rent a <UNK> low <UNK> a month the evans are about to get the largest of family <UNK> being thrown out of the projects with no where to go florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a <UNK> or a grant to help her family but the government doesn't consider her family poor because they have over 4 200 in <UNK> for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately <UNK> over the poverty line james and the kids want to <UNK> for the money but florida is a person of great moral character and doesn't want to do anything <UNK> no matter how dire their <UNK> is in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water br br good times a classic show from the 1970's is about keeping you're head above water in a cruel world james and florida evans both work hard in <UNK> jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social <UNK> of <UNK> i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a <UNK> in the 70s in its first airing on cbs but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in 2006 good times is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day
<START> about the importance of being young having friends and most of all enjoying life through the experience of four friends <UNK> shows to the audience how life was back in the 70's in a small italian village the four <UNK> represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented
<START> who likes awful comedy shows like little <UNK> on the <UNK> the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are one muslims and self <UNK> liberal <UNK> of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all which it is not two old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable badly written stale jokes br br cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left i'd be curious who even writes for this show do you think it's actually muslims or hip funny young people no i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960's br br when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are air farce was only finally just taken off the air thank goodness but we still have lame <UNK> like this hour has 22 minutes and rick <UNK> that we are paying for not to mention this poor excuse for comedy little <UNK> on the <UNK> it is supposed to be <UNK> and funny only the cbc would think this lame show is at all <UNK> or funny shame on the cbc for <UNK> our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching
<START> i can't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror i felt sitting in that cinema watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the director's half hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic bollywood western sholay the biggest problem with <UNK> remake is that he doesn't even try to make a credible film it's evident in every single frame of this movie that <UNK> heart is just not in it what you see on screen is a bad joke at best a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he's been a fan of all his life i've seen several bad films over the years but i can't remember one that's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one consider yourself very brave if you're able to survive the entire film because it <UNK> your patience like few films have before <UNK> may borrow his plot and characters from the original film but his version is trite and hollow and doesn't have any of the spirit and energy of sholay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not way over the top too long too boring and entirely mindless much loved moments from sholay are <UNK> by <UNK> and for that you want to <UNK> his neck one of the most memorable scenes in sholay in which <UNK> as <UNK> climbs up the <UNK> and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with ajay <UNK> playing hero pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself how you wish he'd pulled the trigger and <UNK> us all the agony not only does <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fail as a remake of sholay it's a pretty bad effort even as a stand alone film the <UNK> <UNK> background score sounds more like someone <UNK> <UNK> in the kitchen and the camera work <UNK> between dramatic and head spinning partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film's mostly dead as wood actors <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously <UNK> her lines with pauses staring into camera for effect and generally performing like her life depends upon it <UNK> as <UNK> struggles with his hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his <UNK> career newcomer <UNK> raj playing <UNK> equivalent raj has no acting chops to speak of and can't <UNK> up any of the brooding intensity amitabh bachchan brought to the part in the original film as hero the new age <UNK> ajay <UNK> is entirely hopeless failing miserably in his attempts at comedy but the film's weakest link easily the most shocking casting decision is <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> who steps into the shoes of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> the endearing <UNK> from sholay <UNK> <UNK> is not only the worst actress in this country but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning and she makes you want to <UNK> your <UNK> every time she's on screen and then there is amitabh bachchan playing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version of hindi <UNK> most popular villain <UNK> <UNK> the only actor in this ensemble who <UNK> the film's over the top tone and plays along <UNK> bachchan <UNK> a menacing character who is a treat to watch he's meant to be a comic book villain who <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and he does all of that to good effect but because he's trapped in such a doomed enterprise his performance doesn't really help elevate the film in any way no surprises here i'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it one's of those painful movie watching experiences you wouldn't subject even an enemy to it's not like <UNK> hasn't handled a remake before with <UNK> he gave us a smart gripping take on the godfather and it's a pity he's made this sholay <UNK> out of such a much loved classic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is his worst career decision ever it's also a dark spot on his resume he'll be embarrassed of forever i suspect this film will go down in movie history as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> oh man does this movie ever bite if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre done as cheap as possible and as <UNK> at the same time pc friendly means no nudity a classic element of slasher films cut is it every cliche is <UNK> without a hint of self awareness and the acting oh the acting <UNK> the word horror i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have <UNK> me off
<START> this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production br br poor film making aside the story is vile just sick evil sh t if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if <UNK> scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen <UNK> brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty
<START> i stole this movie when i was a <UNK> in college i've tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler i've never heard of this movie but since he's so funny its gotta be funny wrong i can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match insult war where burning the guy with a good <UNK> causes your <UNK> physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this you'll know its true this movie isn't worth the price i paid for it i've watched a ton of steven segal movies and i've even watched <UNK> twice but i still couldn't watch this
<START> i had seen <UNK> before must be about 10 years ago and i still remember to be very impressed by it that's why i wanted to see it again and all i can say is that it still hasn't lost its power even though i'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that i was ten years ago br br <UNK> tells the tale of the writer brian <UNK> and his girlfriend carrie <UNK> a photographer who want to move to california but instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never <UNK> they choose to make a trip by car he wants to write a book about america's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures but because their car uses an enormous amount of <UNK> they decide to take another couple with them so they can spread the costs of the trip only one couple has answered the add so they will automatically be the lucky ones but they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time when their trip has already started carrie is shocked without wanting to be <UNK> she can only conclude that early <UNK> and adele <UNK> are poor white trailer park trash she definitely doesn't want them in her car but brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway at first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all but gradually early <UNK> changes from a trashy <UNK> into a <UNK> murderer br br not only is the story very impressive so is the acting from our four leads brad pitt is incredible as early <UNK> his performance in this movie may well be his best ever the same for juliette lewis she plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her early and does that really very well but david duchovny and michelle forbes are a surprise as well they both did a very good job and i really wonder why we never heard anything from forbes again since this movie because she really proves to have a lot of talent br br overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story but because of the graphic violence i can imagine that it may not be to everybody's taste although i don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way personally i really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me it's a part of the story that's too important to be left out i reward this movie with an 8 10
<START> other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film that's simply not true and a little unfair br br the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent <UNK> i don't think there's anything wrong with the tarantino esquire way of <UNK> stories together perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try i thought it made the film much more interesting perhaps a few elements of the script need <UNK> but that's about the only fault i can find <UNK> <UNK> gives a great performance as <UNK> also <UNK> <UNK> is stunning and worth the price of admission alone
<START> this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see if you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity then this is just not your cup of tea but i honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from <UNK> goo goo to the fart game aunt <UNK> to the ice cream man ralph and ed to get out there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand ups ever take any of robin williams damon wayans the <UNK> george <UNK> or even the <UNK> like richard <UNK> or red foxx and this will <UNK> it i don't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works that is what it comes down to it is funny as hell br br could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing <UNK> and mr rogers and such on snl if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f word for the first time they are in complete shock br br his first time he says the f word is when he does the skit about mr t being a homosexual br br hey boy hey boy you look mighty cute in them <UNK> now come on over here and f me up the ass br br the crowd <UNK> in <UNK> of laughter no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them but the results were just awesome i have never been <UNK> with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand up in fact the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when i saw south park bigger longer and uncut that comedy was raw and <UNK> and it went for the <UNK> as did delirious i don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video br br i took your kids fishing last week and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and <UNK> their heads in the water for two minutes gus normal kids don't do <UNK> like that gus then they started <UNK> their heads around like this and the m f come up with fish then they looked at each other and said <UNK> goo goo i said can you believe this f n <UNK> br br see it again and be prepared to laugh your <UNK> ass off br br 10 out of 10
<START> el <UNK> is a tough stark utterly brilliant brave work of cinematic art director <UNK> <UNK> with an adaptation by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> novel has created a film that <UNK> the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure <UNK> havoc on adult lives and though the focus is on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on children the <UNK> to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear this film becomes one of the finest anti war documents without <UNK> to <UNK> the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children's march toward <UNK> br br a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain threatened with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of citizens <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> julia <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> victoria <UNK> witness the terror of the assassination of men and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide these wide eyed children become adults carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds br br we then encounter the three who survive into <UNK> where they are all confined to a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roger <UNK> has survived as a male prostitute <UNK> by his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mira and has kept his life style private <UNK> bruno <UNK> has become a <UNK> sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has become a nun and serves the patients in the <UNK> the three are re joined by their environment in the <UNK> and slowly each reveals the <UNK> of their childhood experiences with war <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> love <UNK> <UNK> to be free from his <UNK> and <UNK> must face her own internal needs covered by her white <UNK> habit br br the setting of the <UNK> provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death between lust and love and between devotion and destruction is played out to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable for this viewer these scenes are of <UNK> importance and director <UNK> is to be <UNK> for his <UNK> and bravery in making this story so intense the actors both as children and as adults are splendid roger <UNK> bruno <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are especially fine in <UNK> difficult roles the cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> and the haunting musical score by <UNK> <UNK> serve the director's vision a tough film this but one highly recommended to those who are <UNK> to face the horrors of war and its aftermath in spanish with english subtitles br br grady <UNK>
<START> this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around br br pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet br br even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the <UNK> aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes <UNK> at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a <UNK> it is really just that great br br this movie is one of <UNK> movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy so say good night to the bad guy
<START> funny sad charming these are all words that <UNK> through my head while i was watching this beautiful simple film br br it is rare that a movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with a quiet sense of <UNK> but with a small touch of sadness mixed in br br and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not a lover of the art or can't put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance a beautiful dance <UNK> <UNK> her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast br br beauty pain emotion all the love and little <UNK> of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese <UNK> painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture br br
<START> i <UNK> seen that movie in 20 or more years but i remember the attack scene with the horses wearing gas masks vividly this scene ranks way up there with the best of them including the beach scene on saving private ryan i recommend it strongly
<START> in 1967 i visited the lake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and flew a yellow <UNK> read <UNK> returning to germany the above serious ran on tv and one segment was about the high <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in california in the early <UNK> the real life pilot was bill <UNK> i don't know who played him in the series it turned out that the <UNK> in the film was the same same n number as the one i had <UNK> at lake <UNK> ever since i saw that segment i have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available other segments in that serious were about the baker <UNK> seat an <UNK> to find <UNK> victims etc
<START> taking a break from his <UNK> run in the early '80s steven spielberg directed whoopi goldberg in an adaptation of alice <UNK> the color purple about about the desperate existence of an african american woman in the 1930s watching goldberg play <UNK> it's incredible that this is the same woman who starred in movies like sister act this is the sort of movie that could easily be no make that should be part of the <UNK> in black studies and women's studies there's one scene that may be the most magnificent editing job that's ever been on screen you'll know it when you see it i can't believe that this didn't win a single oscar it may be spielberg's second best movie behind <UNK> list maybe even tied with it also starring danny glover <UNK> <UNK> margaret <UNK> oprah <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and laurence fishburne
<START> i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 and saw both films in a row without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or <UNK> on the meaning of each film <UNK> after sleeping it over i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter and i shall explain why br br before sunrise introduces us with then young actors ethan hawke reality bites dead <UNK> society only 25 at the time of the film's release and julie <UNK> the three colors trilogy then 26 although looking much younger he is a <UNK> american writer <UNK> europe after breaking up with his girlfriend she is a young french student on her way home to paris they meet on the <UNK> vienna train and <UNK> decide to get off the train together the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna <UNK> ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love br br the film has 1990's written all over it back then technology was <UNK> rapidly the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future the characters of jesse hawke and celine <UNK> with all their flaws and inconsistencies <UNK> accent if by mistake or on purpose was half american half french and it <UNK> from one spectrum to the other breaking the character's credibility were a mirror of the time watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie work for me the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while br br all in all sunrise is a dreamy <UNK> through the urban landscapes of vienna a well told classical romantic <UNK> and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future
<START> masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its <UNK> it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art masks to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted written acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it
<START> what a wonderful <UNK> movie stardust is br br i could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it br br at a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a <UNK> glee we all long for br br stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children <UNK> witches pirates ghosts and <UNK> it has the damsel in distress the hero the <UNK> the obstacles spells <UNK> charms and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modern br br stardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently <UNK> next to a wall that <UNK> their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a <UNK> that is <UNK> <UNK> by a <UNK> old <UNK> played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out <UNK> the old guard and escapes through the <UNK> he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called <UNK> where he meets a <UNK> and very sexy young lady named <UNK> she is held captive by a witch and <UNK> by an <UNK> chain while the witch is away <UNK> <UNK> ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is <UNK> to the wall <UNK> where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boy br br the boy named <UNK> grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also <UNK> to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played <UNK> miller goes out once with <UNK> and he <UNK> his love to her after they <UNK> a falling star she tells him he can have her if he <UNK> the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wall br br meanwhile in the kingdom of <UNK> the old king perfectly played by peter o'toole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his <UNK> names are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne br br anyway he <UNK> his ruby charm to the sky and <UNK> that what brings the star to earth br br the star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named <UNK> <UNK> danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> and also an aging witch named <UNK> michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth br br complicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfolds br br <UNK> is the first to find <UNK> but is so <UNK> by his devotion to victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and <UNK> his initial interest lie only in returning <UNK> to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the <UNK> and <UNK> first the <UNK> aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the <UNK> never has death been so funny br br but <UNK> also encounters the witch who <UNK> his mother though he doesn't know it's his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert deniro br br his is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a <UNK> he steals the movie with his <UNK> and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinary br br michelle pfeiffer is wonderful as <UNK> a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and <UNK> <UNK> she makes a perfect damsel jason <UNK> adam <UNK> rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of <UNK> as the fighting <UNK> whom as they die return as ghosts ala <UNK> spirit and high spirits br br moreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was <UNK> cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy br br stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times it's that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other words perfect
<START> i think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated when a person comes to watch a tv show what does he look out for it is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who <UNK> story but most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy full house is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school it makes you laugh and it is not just humor br br yes the <UNK> family is a perfect family a perfectly <UNK> family if any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow but this is a tv show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a <UNK> family on television the very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on br br another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be those <UNK> talks with michelle are extremely touching if one doesn't think of it as childish br br overall i would say after watching every show of full house there is a <UNK> in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows
<START> cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs of course in fact it's one of the best films of the 1950's br br i think all the characters are portrayed amazingly you can see the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and her stepmother the <UNK> of cinderella the mice are funny and sweet too br br i think they changed the tale a bit but i think it's for the best it's such a nice film and i don't think anyone could resist it deep down br br i give it a 8 10 i don't think it's the best disney film but it sure is a true classic
<START> once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you you don't have make an effort to think it is good it's just is you enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you i can't say it is totally flawless but it's near acting great story interesting and with elements of suspense it's a small family story pretty much predictable but it's not the secret itself that matters it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship the blind girl and her cousin the only thing i didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity <UNK>
<START> reasons to watch the movie br br 1 bo derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked she does a pretty good job playing an immature insecure 16 year old beauty in fact br br 2 many shots of a pretty greek island br br but br br 1 peter <UNK> turns in the worst performance by an actor since <UNK> played <UNK> friend in roman <UNK> proceedings of march 15 he delivers each and every line in a delightful <UNK> <UNK> turn down the volume whenever he speaks preferably all the way down br br 2 <UNK> fantasies are sadly tame especially by today's standards a few turns in the bath and as a fully <UNK> model br br 3 the plot is <UNK> than <UNK> costumes
<START> contains spoilers br br hollow man is probably the weakest movie that paul verhoeven director of great movies like total recall starship troopers and <UNK> has ever made br br that's probably not his fault for some reason verhoeven got stuck with an utterly mediocre script and he made the best of it br br the first part of this movie is rather good with lots of cynical jokes great special effects and even <UNK> <UNK> on the soundtrack unfortunately the movie falls flat in the second part were it <UNK> into a standard slasher movie or maybe a very bad alien clone the ending is especially ridiculous spoiler as kevin bacon keeps coming back to life after a number of incidents that should in the logical sense of the word have killed him spoiler and the entire thing is quite shallow indeed the subject of becoming invisible is never fully <UNK> br br but all in all verhoeven manages to stay well above average with this movie br br 1 2 out of stars
<START> what's written on the poster is at birth he was given 6 years to live at <UNK> he takes the journey of a lifetime <UNK> is an american born israeli who was <UNK> with muscular <UNK> disease at the age of one at age of <UNK> after the love toward his 22 years old care <UNK> didn't go well he decided to come to the us to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live he wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and <UNK> <UNK> pounds why your guess is as good as mine even i have seen this film br br obviously it's courageous to live when all he can move is his left <UNK> finger but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who <UNK> his disease <UNK> years ago his doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history people with his disease won't live long what's the point of him showing up at old doctor's door for why is tracking down this old doctor in the us is a journey of his lifetime there are so many things we might be interested in <UNK> life how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger how can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others how did he out lived his doctor's <UNK> how does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature the movie told us none of that instead the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let <UNK> to show up at his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive i thought it was a joke
<START> it has a great name but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money in fact the first 30 <UNK> of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just cant understand whats happening until the action its gone br br and yet the producers <UNK> angel <UNK> calls him an actor but i don't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting period the little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing br br for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it but they didn't and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad i don't buy it br br but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it that might work out br br <UNK>
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is <UNK> the networks and <UNK> quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> i was a fan of the book ever since third grade so of course i had watched the movie read the sequel and then watched the television show it was a good show in itself and now as an adult i still enjoy the show my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book the first time i saw it i was so disappointed that i turned it off but that's coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book kind of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies i found the series wonderful it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going it is truly enjoyable clean and wonderful
<START> things to come is that <UNK> of <UNK> a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to <UNK> is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england <UNK> was at its height <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by sub par model work is most effective the <UNK> titles are strongly reminiscent of german <UNK> graphic design the art director was the great william cameron <UNK> and his sets of the ruins of <UNK> are among his best work <UNK> scott is very seductive as the <UNK> mistress the <UNK> of the 21st century is an equally striking design the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling perhaps this was a <UNK> attempt to contrast the <UNK> <UNK> of this time with the <UNK> of 1970 unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds <UNK> down <UNK> <UNK> is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with 30s technology this is particularly <UNK> since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond <UNK> magnificent speech that concludes the film rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well <UNK> final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly share br br unfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to <UNK> i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film
<START> all right here's the deal if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but i probably <UNK> about as much as i laughed actually i probably <UNK> more than i laughed and if i wasn't literally <UNK> on the outside then i was <UNK> on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that <UNK> you then you simply have no shame whether that's a <UNK> of honor or not is in the eye of the <UNK> i suppose br br i will not deny that i laughed quite a bit but this is a movie that i simply cannot give a <UNK> recommendation due to its subject matter if i were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old church going lady heads to the theater and has a heart attack during one of the <UNK> explicit sex situations well that's just something i don't need on my conscience br br so how raunchy is it hmm try about 100 times worse than the wedding <UNK> honestly my mom would've walked out during the first scene i feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect br br there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that's what i come to expect from the man judd <UNK> who had a hand in both freaks and <UNK> and <UNK> i'm all for making fun of michael <UNK> the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers a run for his money paul rudd <UNK> if i hear ya mo be there one more time i'll ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate br br and when we see a quick 3 second flashback of steve <UNK> singing along to <UNK> word up i laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody <UNK> and then forgot about it br br strangely enough despite the <UNK> there's an admirable moral to the story the movie doesn't portray <UNK> as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin he's really portrayed as a likable admirable character sure he's a little weird after all he has a framed asia poster more <UNK> than an asian kid and a toy collection that features the million dollar man's boss but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin as odd as it may seem there's a bit of an it's ok to wait message br br but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its r rating about as far as it can go that was certainly <UNK> intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you'll love the movie br br i'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes i find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f word or <UNK> sex discussions but that's me like i said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater i just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you a good idea br br there you go my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama <UNK> any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable
<START> caught this on <UNK> yesterday and can't believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she's supposed to be a <UNK> of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they're in love and she's so <UNK> over his death she doesn't go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the <UNK> of a very proper british school <UNK> should have been kicked off the force for her <UNK> abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up <UNK> a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better br br as for the guilt <UNK> and molly feel over jed please it's the <UNK> own damn fault he got turned into <UNK> where's the guilt over poor <UNK> who gets <UNK> on if only i could do the same to the <UNK> behind this movie
<START> it's amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great movie br br i've never much cared for brad pitt though his turns in 12 monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on target br br everyone else in the film gives excellent performances and the movie's slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really happening br br the only thing that keeps this from a 10 in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but that's the only flaw i could find in this cult classic br br if you check this film out try to get the <UNK> <UNK> director's cut for the best viewing option br br rating 9
<START> an interesting concept <UNK> having something to do with a virus but done several times by now overall the movie is too long and drags a bit the editing could have been <UNK> i am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits maybe the movie was rushed to market the lighting was too dark in places but the worst technical problem is the audio the level was good enough to hear the dialog but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them which is very distracting either they were not careful in the recording or the sound mixing could have been better also too much background noise got through the should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes the <UNK> <UNK> of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be <UNK> br br also the acting was a bit flat i am sorry but when i see that the same person writes and stars in a movie in my experience it is a red flag br br but it was a good effort so i gave it a 4
<START> some thirty years ago author <UNK> <UNK> published a book length interview with the <UNK> comic book artist georges <UNK> better known as <UNK> the creator of <UNK> this movie catches up with <UNK> today as he recalls the interview while we listen to the <UNK> <UNK> died in 1983 and see some old photos and footage of the man himself some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of <UNK> and we now know these dealt with his <UNK> from his wife after he had an affair with one of his <UNK> who years later would become his second wife an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the <UNK> books from the early <UNK> and <UNK> books <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> in the lands of the <UNK> to fairly anti <UNK> books just a few years later the blue <UNK> on the whole i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about <UNK> and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater
<START> 'i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain ' this is an <UNK> film it should have been re rated to pg 13 but anyways <UNK> first film and greatest the follow up sucked but i haven't seen for years so here's what i can remember about it the kid prince has to <UNK> with winning over the love of his life <UNK> herself keeping his band together the revolution as themselves and the tension in his family but his rival band the time as themselves is ruining his life like morris himself is trying to steal <UNK> from the kid just like saturday night fever <UNK> and 8 mile really good rent it laugh and cry and if you <UNK> it buy it
<START> i'll bet none of you knew that the famous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made a <UNK> <UNK> expedition to mexico before taking on the <UNK> good thing he did because he would never have known about those t <UNK> that inhabited one particular valley where the locals <UNK> them as gods br br that was understandable what wasn't was the casting of blue eyed ian <UNK> as <UNK> even with the blond hair made famous in beverly hills <UNK> <UNK> black ian looked positively ridiculous at least he made no attempt at a spanish accent br br the real hero of <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> also late of a television series with a semi recurring role in walker texas ranger as detective <UNK> of the dallas <UNK> he finds true love with an aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it wasn't for those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the natives worship br br <UNK> <UNK> looks like they used some <UNK> from the famous sid marty <UNK> series the land of the lost all that was needed was some <UNK> to appear br br if you're interested in finding out about this <UNK> expedition that didn't quite make the history books by all means check out <UNK> <UNK> then try and sit through it with a straight face
<START> the filming is pleasant and the environment is <UNK> realistic i liked that it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the many difficult moral and social <UNK> of the 1930's chinese <UNK> countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times <UNK> even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in <UNK> depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the <UNK> role which <UNK> plays is probably the most true to form both in its <UNK> and in its <UNK> aspect perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough <UNK> <UNK> but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression
<START> they filmed this movie out on long island where i grew up my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water <UNK> disgusting and was very hard to keep <UNK> over and over again especially in the <UNK> scenes yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form it never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as i knew was never released on video and i'm sure wasn't released on dvd yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way i can find it anywhere does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased and which format that would be
<START> and look how a true story with a little help of it's friends a <UNK> and touching script a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of no name actors especially from the 4 <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> becomes a must seen movie 9 10
<START> this movie was released by roger corman so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with br br although some viewers may miss the subtleties in this movie because of the very typical obsessed killer type marketing approach there are unique differences about this movie br br amanda as played by the obviously talented <UNK> <UNK> is a complex character some people like these movies precisely because the violence can seem random but here the <UNK> of past abuse dealt with in a realistic but <UNK> manner are what shape the <UNK> of amanda surprisingly amanda <UNK> herself at the end with an act of love where most of these movies turn into the typical all out fight to the death and the evil character dies just as evil in the end as to begin with br br some rough edges in this picture but i have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its <UNK> and yes originality as compared to the usual especially on a budget
<START> this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who <UNK> what he needed from the actors i just don't know br br but could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more <UNK> of his <UNK> skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princess br br i was disappointed in this movie but don't forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself
<START> i know that this is an <UNK> position concerning zabriskie point but i loved this film i know i know i can <UNK> be called an antonioni fanatic i love <UNK> i love la <UNK> i love <UNK> i love red desert i love <UNK> and i love <UNK> reporter aka the passenger the only antonioni film that i don't love the only one i've ever given less than an 8 10 and one of only three that i have given less than a 10 10 la <UNK> and <UNK> being the other two though i fully acknowledge that i have to see both of them again is beyond the clouds which can fairly be called an awful film however there is not better awful film if you catch my drift so if you're not an antonioni fan you should only <UNK> ignore me if you are even a casual fan though and you are wondering whether this particular film whose name when spoken is often followed by br br a spit which is generally <UNK> by even <UNK> <UNK> is at all worth seeing the answer is yes br br okay the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99 of film <UNK> care only for the narrative of a film well that's not exactly true if a film is amazing in a particular aspect say acting or cinematography or direction and just decent in its narrative film <UNK> might very well love it but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story that's another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years logic then they absolutely hate the film i will actually agree with that in some ways as much as i may dislike it and want to change my view it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative i perceive as poor however other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative this is certainly what must drive viewers away from zabriskie point i could relate the story to you but you probably would just think it was nonsensical it is actually but to me that just made the whole <UNK> more fantastic and beautiful i'd actually compare it <UNK> to 2001 which is my favorite film however 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film br br what zabriskie point has in <UNK> is mood the music helps a lot the score includes a lot of acts of the day including pink <UNK> the mood is kind of similar to the <UNK> of <UNK> other masterpieces filled with loneliness and <UNK> also the freedom that comes from that the best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman her name is daria i know but i don't remember his name pull over in their vehicle next to a historic <UNK> on a desert highway there is beyond the stone wall that has been <UNK> to keep cars from flying off an ancient <UNK> it's basically a rocky desert and the two go to play in it the setting is enormously beautiful the woman says this is such a beautiful place what do you think the man i think it's dead there's no <UNK> to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing this is a lot like sentiments expressed in other antonioni films characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible instead of david locke the protagonist of the passenger fed up with <UNK> we have the young hippie sick of his <UNK> politics he thinks they talk too much and don't act out what they feel is right or at least he says he does it seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situation br br the film is also simply amazing visually <UNK> films are all <UNK> by just a few frames but his visual style was always building i like the passenger more than i do zabriskie point but zabriskie point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect well that might sound odd <UNK> and red desert are amazing <UNK> i think it's the camera movements that are particularly amazing here he obviously made a ton of money on <UNK> which was the biggest <UNK> hit of its day the biggest ever at that point he spends it well here especially with his <UNK> shots one of the film's greatest sequences involves the man who has stolen a man's private airplane dive bombing daria in her car br br the one thing that can be fairly criticized is the film's politics they're certainly <UNK> not that hippies were <UNK> but that <UNK> vision of hippies there weren't any in italy of course are bizarre and well <UNK> through a <UNK> eyes there's a rather childish criticism of advertising but it's a criticism that still exists today i say can't you people just ignore it what does it hurt are you walking around buying things you don't want because of <UNK> or there is also the criticism against capitalism daria a secretary works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves in order to make cheap suburban homes for families rod taylor a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in the time machine and the birds plays her boss the ending which i won't ruin you've got to see it is almost <UNK> cheap i can though understand the treatment of police officers not that i disdain them generally but they were awful at the time they can still be awful now they've always had too much power br br these trite arguments against the american way of life still don't effect my opinion of the film much i find this <UNK> view of america extremely interesting i really don't think a hippie would have <UNK> with antonioni 10 10
<START> i noticed fire was on cable the other night and i began watching it because i couldn't recall anything specific about it other than i remember it being a horrible film when i saw it back in <UNK> twenty years later the film is still awful besides the <UNK> the <UNK> was the most abused <UNK> in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song hearing that song again made me want to <UNK> a <UNK> in my ears to end the <UNK> misery inflicted upon them and to compound this musical assault rob <UNK> character played <UNK> and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was charlie parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a <UNK> all the characters were intensely unappealing although i must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them actually i thought <UNK> <UNK> was appealing and i initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with rob <UNK> character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual <UNK> if such thing were voted upon
<START> no message no symbolism no dark <UNK> just a wonderful <UNK> of music nostalgia and good fun put to <UNK> by people who obviously had a great time doing it it's a refreshing <UNK> to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios of course anything with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is worth watching and <UNK> <UNK> brilliant jazz singing is a bonus this lady is in the same league as the late ella this goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime i feel the need for a warm experience and a <UNK> good natured chuckle just a wonderful film
<START> this intensely involving 2007 character driven suspense drama is like a big <UNK> piece of shakespearean level <UNK> from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out <UNK> <UNK> to the edge performances from his actors consider for starters henry <UNK> lone <UNK> <UNK> in twelve angry men <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mary <UNK> in long day's journey into night rod <UNK> conflicted concentration camp survivor in the <UNK> william <UNK> <UNK> lion in network and paul <UNK> alcoholic lawyer in the verdict the list <UNK> some of the finest screen work of the past half century and you can safely add philip seymour <UNK> desperately controlling andy <UNK> to the ranks at <UNK> director sidney lumet shows no signs of <UNK> <UNK> and in fact he <UNK> in the melodramatic turns of first time screenwriter kelly <UNK> <UNK> plotted script br br the scale of the story is <UNK> small as it focuses on the moral <UNK> that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash woody allen followed a similar <UNK> dynamic in his last film the oddly <UNK> <UNK> dream but lumet is neither <UNK> nor <UNK> in his fierce approach to this <UNK> tale of ambiguity and deception the plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from his real estate <UNK> <UNK> to keep his neglected wife gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit smooth talking andy is about to be exposed in an irs <UNK> meanwhile his younger brother hank is a mass of post divorce <UNK> <UNK> falling way behind in his <UNK> and child support <UNK> br br andy <UNK> a supposedly <UNK> plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there the goal was for the brothers to collect the <UNK> and the parents to claim the insurance murphy's law <UNK> in every possible way starting with andy <UNK> hank to do the job himself after some <UNK> <UNK> hank agrees to it but too scared to do it alone he <UNK> a reckless gun <UNK> <UNK> to handle the robbery by fate the heist occurs on the one day that andy and <UNK> mother is opening the shop and things quickly spiral out of control from there although the back and forth storytelling technique is not new for example <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 21 <UNK> <UNK> approach works effectively in <UNK> certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the <UNK> of the unfortunate event br br the acting is pitch perfect starting with <UNK> riveting performance as andy a <UNK> <UNK> whose cool exterior and <UNK> <UNK> mask layers of <UNK> toward his family i thought he was great in <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> but he is even better here lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually <UNK> ethan hawke as hank <UNK> him with the <UNK> weakness that informs his every ill planned move as their <UNK> father albert finney acts with his typical late career <UNK> but he provides the necessary foundation for the <UNK> level <UNK> marisa tomei is a smart choice to play gina as the actress <UNK> keys in on the <UNK> <UNK> nature of a small but pivotal role the <UNK> theater veteran <UNK> harris now better known as peter <UNK> aunt in the spider man trilogy has precious little time as the mother as does amy ryan as <UNK> bitter ex wife br br there are scenes that border on excessive especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers but the principals <UNK> such energetic <UNK> to them that the <UNK> become forgivable after the disappointment of the cartoonish find me guilty it is refreshing to see lumet in peak form here the 2008 dvd offers <UNK> informative commentary from lumet hoffman and hawke all of whom <UNK> with ease and insight throughout along with the original theatrical trailer there is also a better than average 24 minute <UNK> directed by sidney lumet how the devil was made which features on set footage and snippets of interviews with lumet two of the producers and the principal actors
<START> henry fool is a better film but this is the perfect way to follow up a film like <UNK> fool ' to take henry very seriously his <UNK> and his mysterious aura even the opening shot of <UNK> <UNK> when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully <UNK> through <UNK> grim ' the over the top jokes that are more or less <UNK> jokes about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves are good but the opening of the film is a little <UNK> in them also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring yes it's intention but it feels forced and over used it goes beyond jarring to what i'd like to call annoying it's a flawed film but a must see for any hartley or <UNK> <UNK> fan br br and don't listen to stupid reviews don't watch this unless you've seen the first film the intrigue satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool it's a sequel that's just dumb
<START> ok it was a good american pie <UNK> <UNK> goes off to college with his buddy <UNK> during their arrival they meet up with <UNK> cousin dwight the two <UNK> to become <UNK> and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex tits and some hot girls along the way in a few words there is a lot more sex nudity and alcohol it is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an american pie movie granted it isn't as great as the first three is is a good movie if you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits get this movie if you enjoy seeing a bunch of <UNK> making <UNK> of themselves go to this movie if you want to see the full thing get the <UNK> addition one last thing this is a better attempt than the last two american <UNK>
<START> or maybe it just is this bad the plot is a cheap rehash of the first which is weird since it's supposed to be a prequel not a sequel pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first with scenes <UNK> the things that happened in the first only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely where the first had a great cast this one consist of b list actors and rejects the acting is mostly <UNK> bad half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first as is nearly every major character including the ones who weren't in the first movie i realize this was made up by a tv series pilot episode but that's no excuse they didn't have to turn the bad footage into a movie only one thing is <UNK> good and that's the erotic sequences however as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1 if you have a chance to see it for free and you're a straight guy it could be worth checking out if you want something erotic that isn't porn if not avoid at all costs 1 10
<START> did anyone edit this film or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes it's ok though i fell asleep watching it the first time then i fell asleep the second time and the third time the plot is actually not the worst i've seen but it's close the acting is not the worst i've seen either but it's close the production well i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life not trying to be <UNK> but unhinged could have used some more production br br please don't think i'm a <UNK> of horror films or even that i didn't enjoy this film i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it the gruesome moments were not too poorly done but could have been done better even with a <UNK> budget br br characters seemed <UNK> developed or ignored all together twist ending was pretty bad and the exposition took forever without exposing much br br i'd recommend avoiding this movie br br 1 10
<START> what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on <UNK> may be a lot of fun this movie set a <UNK> in the action comedy genre of the <UNK> cinema <UNK> characters <UNK> story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining <UNK> and <UNK> join their efforts to fight against a cold and <UNK> <UNK> in a time when it's difficult to trust someone this movie will surprise you the other side of the <UNK> of analyze me but not alike with nothing to envy and if you like to know <UNK> as there where few scenes of downtown and the city center
<START> an excellent film depicting the cross <UNK> in the lives of a multi ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural pacific <UNK> solid directing and writing along with fine acting especially the performances by <UNK> <UNK> and dan <UNK> interestingly this film was made in the same year as the highly successful crash written and directed by paul <UNK> the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angeles and the characters may seem to be better <UNK> with each other in apart from that but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as <UNK> as any of those in crash for those viewers who appreciated crash this is a must see film also fans of jim <UNK> and john cassavetes will like this movie
<START> though the story is essentially routine and the surprise ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience you can see what attracted these good actors to the project it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine and shine they do the film is <UNK> made for its time it was remade in 2000 as under suspicion and if you only want to see one version of the story that's all it deserves really i recommend the latter one with <UNK> up to date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at the ending however still blows 1 2
<START> anna charlotte burke who is just on the verge of <UNK> begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life especially involving a boy named mark elliott <UNK> who she meets in her dreams br br very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a pg 13 rating this is not for children also if you hate fantasies stay far away but if you're game for something different this fits the bill br br well directed by bernard rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice scary <UNK> the only thing that <UNK> this from being a really great movie is burke she's not a very good actress it's no surprise that this has been her only film and it hurts the movie however everybody else is just great br br <UNK> is very good as mark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a british accent very well is also very good as <UNK> mother and ben cross is both frightening and sympathetic as <UNK> father br br a sleeper hit when released in 1988 it's since faded away that's too bad it's really very good
<START> this movie is gorgeous it's real and down to heart but at the same time totally crazy the characters are easy to fall in love with because they have so many different minds but each of us could refer to at least on in canada we don't have many movies from eastern europe and for the few i have seen <UNK> is one of the best it's very funny and magic if you want to see something new and refreshing go see <UNK>
<START> first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of <UNK> and boss <UNK> burt reynolds is not boss <UNK> and even worse was m c <UNK> as <UNK> if they ever watched the show <UNK> was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney <UNK> than the role he played in this movie br br the movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy <UNK> and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously <UNK> to a near stop but goes on to win the race
<START> this is the epitome of fairytale the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are <UNK> pure danes deniro and <UNK> are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of <UNK> outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of hilarious subtleties the previews do not do this movie justice my fiancé and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try
<START> this movie is great simply it is rare that you find a comedy with levels and this is a bloody good example of such when i saw this movie first as the credit rolled a friend and i looked to one another and asked <UNK> you just catch that ' for those <UNK> look at the levels see the comparisons between <UNK> and the people in the club the <UNK> see the diverse characters each <UNK> for position and if you see nothing else see the connection between the cure of <UNK> and the path through the film it's all in <UNK> head the opening line about <UNK> world the closing scene with the camera going into <UNK> head and inside a whole universe thoroughly <UNK> wonderful cartoon gangsters beautiful beautiful beautiful
<START> before starting to watch the show i've heard it was great and <UNK> very interesting what a deception the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and <UNK> of <UNK> writers and what about the <UNK> and colors they are so extreme that it is painful to watch colors are not <UNK> they are over <UNK> like scripts are <UNK> and show is overrated this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and <UNK> thinking that because these ingredients are the best they are sufficient unfortunately for this show the only two ingredients of this show are finally <UNK> and a total lack of credibility
<START> <UNK> starts on a cold dark <UNK> night as a bus drops off three <UNK> outside a bus station a young boy named mason jesse <UNK> a college professor dr howard <UNK> david <UNK> a woman named sharon phillips laurie <UNK> inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus are stranded for the night in the waiting area they find two other people <UNK> jim wolf a sleeping woman named lindsay <UNK> <UNK> who is currently having a terrifying nightmare br br while swimming in an <UNK> pool lindsay encounters befriends guy named billy waters jesse johnson the next time lindsay sees billy he <UNK> into the pool then seemingly disappears into thin air before he <UNK> shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago br br lindsay wakes up tells the others about her nightmare everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently decide to share them to pass the time br br next up is mason who tells a story of how he two friends scott david r <UNK> jimmy will <UNK> are <UNK> during a camping trip br br then it's sharon whose story revolves around a <UNK> named tom williams <UNK> <UNK> who she phones up in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampire br br it's <UNK> turn next he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson <UNK> <UNK> boll back to homicidal life br br finally dr <UNK> tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec war god named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> back to life br br then it's back to the bus station for one last predictable twist br br written produced directed by daniel <UNK> <UNK> is one of the worst horror <UNK> i've ever seen i usually really like this sub genre the script by <UNK> lacks what is needed for films such as <UNK> to work you can see the final twist coming a mile off each story is really lame the first one is totally pointless didn't seem to have an ending the best thing about these <UNK> are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist the second story is predictable again just ends without any payoff so it continues throughout <UNK> that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch have no reward for doing so the character's dialogue are poorly written the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own as a whole the film totally sucks at least each story doesn't last long i liked the idea behind the <UNK> segments br br director <UNK> was obviously working with a very low budget it shows all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then <UNK> is for you the stories are neither clever scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything having said that it does have a few nice scenes some surprising <UNK> shines through on occasion violence gore wise there isn't much happening in <UNK> a ripped out heart a decapitated head a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets br br technically <UNK> is poor stuff that won't impress anyone basic cinematography bad music cheap special effects below average production values <UNK> also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever period the acting is also of a very low standard br br i am sure a lot of effort was put into <UNK> as a low budget film at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least but that still doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap similar anthology films like tales from the crypt 1972 asylum 1972 the vault of horror 1973 dr <UNK> house of horrors 1965 <UNK> 1982 tales from the <UNK> the movie 1990 are far superior to <UNK> so watch one of those instead
<START> a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia <UNK> and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young fresh faced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the <UNK> slowly their <UNK> state is <UNK> the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for <UNK> the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or ground breaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible
<START> a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane <UNK> most accessible and least <UNK> story told well
<START> this is indeed a treat for every <UNK> fan some might think that it's a little over the top and that it is only about <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> but i think it's similar to any other concert video except for the fact that this is marc <UNK> not just any guy i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution with <UNK> john and <UNK> <UNK> this clip alone is worth all the money i can't believe they <UNK> release this version as the single the movie is really superb especially for us danes now i wasn't alive during the 70's but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them the media didn't play or show any of the popular music back then including marc <UNK> and t rex they only played a little with the doors only the really popular songs though so i know from my dad that seeing this gives him back a part of his youth he never got to experience br br i wont make this too long so if you're the least bit fan of marc <UNK> you need to see this you might find it boring or as said before a little over the top but at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever in action br br only thing that disappoints me a little is that ride a white <UNK> isn't on the tape but i forgive it since <UNK> and get it on are so wonderfully played
<START> i bought this movie last weekend at my local movie gallery it was buy 2 get 2 free and i needed one more so i chose this one horrible mistake the box reads like it would be a really good movie well it starts out like it is going to be this great movie for about 5 minutes that is the movie is about a young woman <UNK> who gets killed trying to save her beau jack from a bull <UNK> dad <UNK> is a <UNK> that the <UNK> are afraid of he assumes that jack killed <UNK> because she was supposedly afraid of this bull and goes on this hunt to find him that was the first 5 minutes that is good what follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse whoever wrote the script in my opinion had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio dj named mary who gives him a ride i think mary is supposed to be a virgin mary type character you know <UNK> mother but who knows i couldn't make heads or <UNK> of it as they're running we get to see bad guys magical visions ghostly encounters flashbacks etc and all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on needless to say i took the movie back and <UNK> it for something else it's horrible i tell ya horrible and there is absolutely no bull fighting in this movie unless you count the first minute of the movie hope i helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie
<START> my 10 10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked slaughter high even before watching it yes it's the typical revenge several years after a dirty prank story but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here i couldn't have predicted that <UNK> scene in a million years br br ok so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new well it doesn't pretend to it's the sort of flick that the characters in scream probably watched and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie after all who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things obviously it's got sort of a <UNK> <UNK> as people get <UNK> for doing what the '60s <UNK> but still you gotta love this stuff so with apologies to don <UNK> this <UNK> didn't sing for the king and queen
<START> red <UNK> was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease br br his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american <UNK> of years back br br he would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember <UNK> and <UNK> in the monologue how can we ever forget san <UNK> red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your <UNK> br br go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to <UNK> at age 11 or so his wife georgia died by suicide
<START> i really enjoyed this movie as a young kid at that age i thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of it's about sports now several years later i can look back and see what a well designed movie this was this movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues that kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which i don't think is to our <UNK> benefit sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in no seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see a movie about baseball disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world br br as a young adult the performance of al and the other angels seems far less impressive however i will give credit to the actors playing both children and danny glover who all did a fantastic job
<START> the only reason i <UNK> this movie was because 1 i live in cleveland and <UNK> plays basketball for us now and 2 i've always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were <UNK> outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my 12 year old son and i just <UNK> and couldn't look at the screen when <UNK> started <UNK> and we kept wondering why max didn't wish for <UNK> to fix that front tooth of his but for all it's <UNK> we just couldn't stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or <UNK> or a <UNK> pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched <UNK>
<START> some people say steve <UNK> <UNK> antics and <UNK> personality are only an act watch this film it's obvious he can't act br br steve irwin <UNK> star of the small screen in his crocodile hunter <UNK> croc files and eponymous crocodile hunter series you see a <UNK> trend here or is it just me rockets his larger than <UNK> persona to the big screen with crocodile hunter <UNK> course <UNK>  there's a definite trend of words beginning with <UNK> basically an episode of crocodile hunter <UNK> together with a b movie br br on a mission to <UNK> a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer <UNK> <UNK> steve and wife <UNK> are unaware that the croc is being <UNK> by american spies <UNK> <UNK> and kenneth <UNK> out to recover a spy satellite <UNK> it has <UNK> will it hurt my credibility to say they're on a <UNK> course with <UNK> what credibility ed note br br the plot is irrelevant as it is <UNK> animal <UNK> that <UNK> the film if you find his persona trying the film is a failure but if you're a fan of either him as a businessman <UNK> or just plain ass <UNK> or his television shows expect more of the same on a wide screen budget br br john <UNK> faithful <UNK> best mate and <UNK> of the crocodile hunter <UNK> can it be called that with a straight face writes and directs with the same <UNK> <UNK> that made steve a household <UNK> <UNK> br br the most jarring aspect of this movie is that steve one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the <UNK> points going by as he speaks and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of 10 years <UNK> ally and closest friend treat it like it is one of their documentaries breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera whilst all the other characters behave as if they're in a bad movie <UNK> it wouldn't be so <UNK> if steve and <UNK> were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the bad americans constantly <UNK> <UNK> life we confused viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom <UNK> or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting crisp audio and seven action angles br br while <UNK> is unfairly painted as <UNK> mildly incompetent sidekick her acting consists of <UNK> inept line reads and <UNK> about in <UNK> shaped <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the last i'm not complaining steve goes about his business as usual of show and tell with creatures intent on killing him doing all his stunts himself because well to him they're not really stunts just a day at the office br br of course watching this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> adventures after his tragic death in september 2006 casts a strange <UNK> over the proceedings but to those of us who never met him this kind of <UNK> as well as various <UNK> of the crocodile hunter series in constant re runs keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile <UNK> the wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him and i truly wish them the best in following in his <UNK> <UNK> br br so enjoy this <UNK> for what it is  a half baked movie featuring a full on legend he died doing what he loved  <UNK> with <UNK> and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that br br movie <UNK> visit <UNK> com
<START> going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes john waters happy birthday john made this parody of the celebrity art world edward <UNK> plays the title character a working class teenager in <UNK> who loves to photograph things when a new york agent <UNK> taylor discovers his work she offers him his big break which he accepts but once he hits it big he has to <UNK> everything br br basically pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity the sort of thing that we might expect sure but with waters directing there's always a few things to shock us you'll know them when you see them i certainly recommend it also starring christina <UNK> <UNK> stole and patty <UNK>
<START> shocking well made <UNK> is an <UNK> tale of atrocious murder and evil forces br br small town doctor tries to discover who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders br br <UNK> is a tight mystery with some horrific murder sequences that builds to an off beat and eerie climatic twist the murder scenes are intense and gory so this isn't a film for the <UNK> the direction of john <UNK> along with a bizarre music score combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight br br the cast isn't bad either the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town also good are the performances of <UNK> <UNK> as the local reporter helen hughes as the town <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as a tormented psychic teen br br all around <UNK> is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re discovered and re <UNK> br br out of
<START> predictable plot simple dialogue shockingly <UNK> performances but robert downey jr is so cute i gave this poor man's afternoon special a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved
<START> this is one of those westerns that well stands practically alone in the <UNK> quality of its dialog very few can hold up to it over the long <UNK> that said the rest is pretty bad nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch junior <UNK> and perhaps a few more br br it is <UNK> with weaknesses john drew <UNK> the most glaring however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it its right after kid <UNK> kills the sheriff and goes to jack <UNK> place trying to <UNK> him into a fight wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western
<START> the king is dead long live the king the <UNK> of <UNK> shack two the family underneath the stairs and <UNK> beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right but there is a new king yep all <UNK> the new king down to earth but some things like tiny tim for example are so bad they are good some day this could take out the <UNK> rocky horror picture show as a cult film so go see this this well just take my word for it go see it all <UNK> the new king
<START> it's a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated movies series of adventure and fantasy br br the film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done but for be who she is daughter of the <UNK> of hell <UNK> himself br br then she seeks revenge and the rest you better see it from the movie br br i liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the <UNK> in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics but one way or another it's the story of lady death
<START> other than susan <UNK> wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes and peck is as always impeccable the stirring alfred newman sound score with the stirring twenty third <UNK> is unforgettable even after these many years the scene with <UNK> is a bit on the hokey side but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day the song of ruth and esther and the king it is worth watching and raymond <UNK> is excellent as the prophet nathan the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as <UNK> and <UNK> meadows as <UNK> david's estranged first wife
<START> this film was the <UNK> of the 1990 academy award for best animated short film over the last few weeks i have seen dozens of the <UNK> and <UNK> of this award from the last 30 years and i really think that this film might just be the worst of them all yet it wasn't just a <UNK> but it won i assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre br br the film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super skinny uncle <UNK> the appear to be simple <UNK> figures who are moved using stop motion animation all are identical with the same faces bodies and clothes the only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs they are all standing on a large platform that is suspended as if by magic in space each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform the platform begins <UNK> slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform this goes on and on and on and on for the longest time the only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least aside from passable stop motion animation this short offers nothing of interest to me nothing br br by the way the great short <UNK> knack also came out in 1989 and i have no idea why it was not among the <UNK> it was a great short and was far better than any of the <UNK> that year or the year before perhaps <UNK> success in previous years resulted in a bias against them but <UNK> knack is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it could pixar have not entered it this seems unlikely
<START> when this film was made the hippie thing had gone mainstream the ideas of the counter culture was well established that is why such a big film could be made yet it has something to say and it is said really beautifully apart from those <UNK> only waiting for the <UNK> material this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film by the most the soundtrack to this film which actually became more popular than the film itself is another plus pink <UNK> careful with that axe eugene suits really well with the explosions the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood but it seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most if you didn't understand it which seems to be the case for the most i'll give you some hints the man tough guy what ever his name is mark is a part of a reality group he leaves this group saying something like i'm willing to die but not of boredom he later go for a <UNK> with a stolen plane probably to seek some action as he is in the air grateful <UNK> dark star from the live dead album is played i think this song contains the phrase shall we go you and i while we can this is though not heard in the film perhaps <UNK> it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential in the plane he <UNK> up a girl daria who is driving in her car to a <UNK> about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super relaxing place in the desert where everything is so simple and nice for the whole family by diving down almost hitting the car he lands the plane and joins the girl on her way to detroit they stop at zabriskie point where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature later a family with a big car of the type which you sleep in and a speed boat is showed visiting zabriskie point the father saying something like what a waste driving all the way up here and the kid sitting inside the car <UNK> i <UNK> a this wasn't much better than on the telly attitude daria takes mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style with the identity number changed to no war on one side and no words on the other bucks sucks is also written on the plane mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from saying to daria before he leaves i don't risk anything or something one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny this because he has the feeling that the environment that <UNK> don't give him anything i wonder what happens in the real world on the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane daria hears this on the radio but decides to go to the <UNK> in the fancy mansion here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend she enjoys fresh water running down a rock more than the swimming pool inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti <UNK> she looks out through a glass wall holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped the business men is seen arguing the one side eager to make a big deal the other afraid of losing money daria leaves the house and looks back at it <UNK> it blowing up after the house several other things blow up for example a television she smiles happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with mark look upon as something negative br br to <UNK> mark obviously experience the reality group as not very useful as they just sit and talk taking no action he clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are and it seems like he feels that it's no use fighting against it he wants to leave he helps daria who is in mind but not in action seeing his point of view where his feeling of being <UNK> turns out leading to his death one can hope daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more <UNK> in the film you see how a town la is being <UNK> by commercial too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point you see business men deciding what is the future et <UNK> and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world br br i have only seen the film once so i have not caught all points but i certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say and i find it strange that this film can be called meaningless if you say the points are being too obvious i can see why this film probably intended to appeal to the post hippie <UNK> digging the thoughts of anti establishment even though it has a lot to say and its message is still needed today things pretty much <UNK> in the same direction as it did before the sixties zabriskie point is a really great film telling a story about quite normal young people not far out hippies <UNK> around tip toe on acid digging everything seeking what they <UNK> as real <UNK> with the conventional and it is done in a truly beautiful way
<START> the movie is plain bad simply awful the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies or not br br the problem seems to be with mainly the directors this movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance but they were directed so poorly the poor script did not help either br br this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half for instance br br after his 1st big concert ajay <UNK> meets up with <UNK> <UNK> from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again and all <UNK> <UNK> finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman what a load of crap seriously not to mention the <UNK> soundtrack whatever happened to <UNK> <UNK> loy br br ajay <UNK> is total miscast for portraying a <UNK> br br only saving grace are the good performances in the second half ajay shines as his character shows his dark side so does salman as the drug addict br br watch it maybe only for the last half hour
<START> another entertaining travolta dance flick great music mood and scenes debra <UNK> is beautiful like saturday night fever this macho film features extremely improbable scenes of beautiful women falling for travolta and almost begging him to have sex with them
<START> while being one of the stars of this film doesn't necessarily give me <UNK> insight i do know quite a bit of what was first there and what ended up on the screen i remember seeing the original cut of <UNK> <UNK> and being very pleased it was funny sexy raunchy all the main <UNK> of a drive in film you have to remember this was shot and released before all the rest animal house <UNK> etc so in its own way this flick was truly ahead of its time for whatever reasons the film was given to the main <UNK> who editing out half the original film and then edited in should i say <UNK> the most random scenes ever the fat guy the people with goat heads what the heck was all that i'm sure it was put in for additional t a but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to <UNK> to a <UNK> and painful halt but all in all it's a fun memory for me especially in that i'm able to say that the worst movie i've ever seen i'm in
<START> i think we all begin a lot of reviews with this could've made a great movie a demented ex con <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> suburban family his target revenge <UNK> manipulation <UNK> usual laying on of the <UNK> <UNK> but unfortunately somewhere in <UNK> high rise a <UNK> came down everyone ham it up br br nolte only speaks with <UNK> raised lange <UNK> her way through <UNK> lewis <UNK> her way though her scenes and bobby d well he's on a whole other magic carpet affecting some sort of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accent hybrid he <UNK> fat <UNK> and <UNK> at random atrocities such as problem child and i want you to imagine the accent mentioned above now imagine it <UNK> brain <UNK> religious <UNK> at top volume like he <UNK> six <UNK> and you have de <UNK> <UNK> here most distracting of all though is his most overdone use of the de niro face he's so <UNK> for eyes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lips <UNK> <UNK> bob you looked like plastic man br br the story apparently began off screen 14 years earlier when nolte was unable to spare de niro time in the <UNK> for various <UNK> upon release he feels <UNK> <UNK> of him back then <UNK> the <UNK> of he and his <UNK> and we're supposed to give de <UNK> character a slight pass because nolte <UNK> information that <UNK> <UNK> his sentence de niro being one of these criminals who despite being guilty of <UNK> acts feels his lack of freedom <UNK> continuing such acts on the outside <UNK> kay br br he goes after <UNK> near mistress in a scene some may want to turn away from his wife his daughter the family dog ya know which is one of the shortcomings of wesley <UNK> screenplay utter predictability as each of de <UNK> <UNK> becomes more gruesome you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens <UNK> isn't to be totally <UNK> as he manages a few compelling dialogue driven moments de niro and <UNK> seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film's best scene but mostly it's all over <UNK> <UNK> cartoonish <UNK> approach comes off as forced not to mention the horribly outdated re worked bernard <UNK> score i kept waiting for the wolf man to show up with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick unintentionally comedic that is you know those scenes where something <UNK> horrific is happening but you can't help but <UNK> out of sight of others you'll do it here nolte and lange <UNK> about infidelity de <UNK> thumb <UNK> he cross dressing and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> constant mind <UNK> no end in sight <UNK> <UNK> of all the philosophy he <UNK> in prison i wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family br br i always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers but here it's necessary this really is <UNK> version of freddy krueger the manner in which de niro <UNK> speaks stalks <UNK> pain right down to his one liners is vintage freddy upon being <UNK> by a pot of thrown water you <UNK> to offer <UNK> hot please and that's just one example br br unless you were a fan of the original <UNK> flick and want a thrill out of seeing <UNK> peck and mitchum nearly 30 years later or want a serious head shaking film experience avoid a trip to the cape
<START> the film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional japanese house complete with <UNK> roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen <UNK> appears that reads <UNK> <UNK> japan <UNK> a young japanese <UNK> samurai named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> walks up the <UNK> path to the house inside waits <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with whom he is having an affair behind her husband <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> back who happens to be <UNK> teacher <UNK> unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other his honour destroyed the <UNK> samurai brutally murders both <UNK> and <UNK> before committing suicide over a century later and ted <UNK> edward albert arrives in japan on a working holiday with his wife laura susan george and their young daughter amy amy <UNK> their close friend alex curtis doug <UNK> who works for the american <UNK> helps them out by finding them a place to stay you don't need me to you where he <UNK> says it's going so cheap because it's haunted to which both ted and laura laugh off as they obviously don't believe in ghosts at least for the time being that is almost immediately the film goes into cliché mode lights turn on and off by themselves laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local <UNK> monk henry <UNK> gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it's too late which they ignore of course the spirits of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a <UNK> witches <UNK> <UNK> curse put upon them but there may be a way they can break the curse unfortunately for the <UNK> family it could potentially cost them their marriage daughter and possibly even their very lives br br directed by kevin connor i thought this was a pretty average film ok to watch once if you've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you'll probably have completely forgotten it nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there's nothing particularly good about the film either the script by robert <UNK> from the novel by james <UNK> is a little on the dull side and strictly by the numbers a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction doesn't help things there are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic <UNK> that try to get amy and her babysitter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and there is a scene where the <UNK> monk <UNK> the house and the ghosts are <UNK> outside unable to get back in however that is until ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in some <UNK> one more thing i think it was a bad idea to have doug <UNK> who was <UNK> when he made this try his hand at kung fu and oriental sword fighting george gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very <UNK> sex scene with <UNK> although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super <UNK> were taken to ensure no below the <UNK> nudity was present apart from a couple of mostly off screen <UNK> there's no blood gore or violence to speak about the <UNK> ghost effects are ok but they ain't going to impress many people these days it's <UNK> enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the japanese setting and <UNK> is <UNK> as this film could have been set in america england or any western country without having to change a thing an ok time <UNK>
<START> finally the uncut version of baby face <UNK> and from what source the library of <UNK> the restored four minutes snippets here and there make for a much better film we now know that baby face was <UNK> by her old man from the time she was at least <UNK> years of age another reason <UNK> for her behavior and cold <UNK> exterior br br barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers notice the <UNK> a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality <UNK> with power cunning and revenge yet <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> when called for a very difficult portrayal to make convincing barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top literally she still has good in her heart note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as <UNK> the marvelous actress <UNK> harris and the old <UNK> and though she exploits her sexuality to make <UNK> of men who are rich and powerful those same men are attempting to exploit her for their <UNK> desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her br br lily powers fails to understand at first that emotions are difficult to ride that it's easy to lose control one possible result is death <UNK> a <UNK> to a star of course <UNK> can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the <UNK> and it's a cold lonely location br br a word should be said about the philosophy of <UNK> <UNK> whose will to power is <UNK> in baby face by the elderly <UNK> who befriends <UNK> when she is still turning tricks for her old man baby face was released the same year <UNK> hitler came to power in germany though it's highly unlikely that the semi <UNK> hitler understood much about <UNK> he considered himself a <UNK> to the <UNK> degree and <UNK> it along side his other <UNK> baby face serves as an <UNK> of the popular interpretation of <UNK> will to power concept especially in the final scenes br br although you've got the <UNK> little baby face is <UNK> as a theme for baby face an even more telling and <UNK> melody is w c <UNK> st louis blues played throughout the film especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes st louis blues is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond <UNK> to eternal values <UNK> is singing a raw <UNK> version of st louis blues when lily now <UNK> with the lyrics orders her to stop br br the restored version of baby face makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy
<START> i thought this movie was pretty good some parts were corny but that's understandable since it was made more than <UNK> years ago i thought the best performance in the movie was given by <UNK> morgan who played <UNK> convincingly jack <UNK> is also really good as mike o'brien even though i'm not a big frank sinatra fan i think he was very good in this movie if your have a <UNK> for a silly over the top musical comedy higher and higher is the movie for you br br
<START> hated it if you believe that everyone in the south is dumb morally <UNK> stupid violent a religious nut or a child <UNK> then this film may be for you everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant in one scene two older men are talking in a general store and one mentions that he had <UNK> a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes the man seemed proud of his actions and the other man clearly took it as a normal part of life very nice a teenage girl walks the back roads looking for her sister and no one offers to help her despite an obvious limp and lack of food or water no <UNK> etc <UNK> character is not only thoroughly disgusting and slimy but he is shown to be a religious believer who typical for hollywood reflects the vile nature of christians a scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of cape fear the one with deniro bible <UNK> being <UNK> by the bad guy i am from the great <UNK> but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people i know who are from <UNK> <UNK> al ms <UNK> <UNK> etc
<START> jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story <UNK> his reputation as the likely <UNK> to the late great bruce lee if enter the dragon <UNK> the so called <UNK> mark of lee's greatness in the 70s then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80s br br forget about the rush hour trilogy or any of his us efforts the one film that really <UNK> chan's excellence not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking bone <UNK> kung fu <UNK> as well as his movie career was this police story the first in a series of successful cop films set in <UNK> present day hong kong br br i've seen many of his efforts likewise the us based rush hour <UNK> in the <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> to name and frankly many of them pale into <UNK> compared to police story in those movies we saw a less <UNK> <UNK> version of jackie of whom didn't get the opportunity to <UNK> his fighting abilities to the maximum not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master police story to name br br the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed the flying <UNK> of glass chan who is left <UNK> outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman <UNK> drives through the streets of the town and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of <UNK> objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with br br considering he is known for <UNK> and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in <UNK> way <UNK> <UNK> in showing his <UNK> as a <UNK> himself by not relying on one is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert especially as he has the <UNK> to show for it thus he has proved that he is no one trick <UNK> when it comes down to <UNK> and coming up with various and clever looking moves br br story wise there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative it makes up with its end to end action and fight sequences as for the dialogue well it's not a really huge aspect of the film which is why most fans of <UNK> and martial arts films are more interested in action as opposed to the story br br unlike say the matrix there are no <UNK> or cgi or any form of computer <UNK> involved what you see is what you get and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic full of action and <UNK> stunts it is miles better than <UNK> in the <UNK> rush hour and all his other american efforts br br police story is an excellent film and one i'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a <UNK> jackie chan fan but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first
<START> we have high expectations with this one because its zombi 3 the official sequel to zombi 2 and directed by lucio fulci however its co directed by bruno mattei from night of the zombies and not written by <UNK> <UNK> but by <UNK> <UNK> night of the zombies and its shot in the <UNK> like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies hell of the living dead a lot as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi 2 <UNK> <UNK> who produced zombi 2 and its editor <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> gave zombi 2 its magic zombi 3 is not magical its like a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> without the <UNK> <UNK> but over the years i've grown to accept zombi 3 i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room there was a senseless fulci cut and the mattei fulci cut is the one on dvd
<START> after finally viewing this movie in its entirety i am completely <UNK> by the <UNK> it has received by critics and online users alike is it the worst western ever no i wouldn't say that but the last great american western a phrase i saw applied to it more than once not even close br br a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i've ever seen the movie can be <UNK> in <UNK> per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life there's so many instances of this that it's distracting cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often br br if bad dialogue doesn't bother you then how about bad <UNK> few westerns can show you <UNK> that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously it's okay if there's a comic edge to such <UNK> such as in <UNK> but in <UNK> the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early <UNK> is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns the final showdown somewhat <UNK> the director on this score but by then i was so <UNK> in the movie that it was beyond saving br br other than those flaws i can say the visuals are stunning the movie's well shot and the settings all look great the acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with however if you're looking for the last great american western do yourself a favor go rent <UNK> instead br br 3 out of 10
<START> i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn sensitive it is inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways at least i'm not a bore son i hear that <UNK> <UNK> and sarah silverman are <UNK> up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year
<START> <UNK> to <UNK> is a real treat for all fans of british cinema not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy but it is a cinematic flashback to a <UNK> age with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life br br stanley <UNK> plays <UNK> resident arthur <UNK> who after the accidental <UNK> of an <UNK> bomb discovers a wealth of medieval treasure <UNK> to the <UNK> century duke of <UNK> that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last <UNK> years br br accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal <UNK> signed by king edward iv of england which has never been officially <UNK> to state that that particular london street had been <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which means that in the eyes of international law <UNK> and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of <UNK> and their tiny street an independent country in it's own right and a law <UNK> itself br br this sets the war <UNK> and <UNK> residents up in good <UNK> as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and <UNK> so in an act of drunken <UNK> they burn their <UNK> books destroy and ignore their clothing <UNK> <UNK> disregard british <UNK> laws etc <UNK> themselves fully independent from britain br br however what then happens is ever <UNK> black <UNK> and <UNK> crook follows suit and crosses the <UNK> into <UNK> as a <UNK> from the law and post war <UNK> to sell their dodgy goods and half of <UNK> <UNK> follow them in order to dodge the <UNK> making their quiet happy little <UNK> a <UNK> of thieves and a rather crowded one at that br br appealing to <UNK> for assistance they are told that due to developments this is now a matter of foreign policy which his <UNK> government is reluctant to become involved which leaves the residents high and dry they do however <UNK> the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully <UNK> customs office at the end of the road mainly to <UNK> <UNK> than to ensure any safety for the residents of <UNK> br br eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege with the <UNK> residents slowly running out of water and food but never the less fighting on in true british style as one <UNK> resident quotes we're english and we always were english and it's just because we are english we are fighting so hard to be <UNK> br br a sentiment that is soon <UNK> throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor <UNK> plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them by throwing food and supplies over the <UNK> wire <UNK> br br will <UNK> who has fought off so may <UNK> throughout the centuries finally be brought to it's knees by this new <UNK> of <UNK> especially as these ones are english br br great tale and great fun throughout not to be missed
<START> i saw this recent woody allen film because i'm a fan of his work and i make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort they were right this is a confused movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female mid life crisis it fails at all three br br alice <UNK> <UNK> is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of <UNK> luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children this rather mundane plot concept is <UNK> up with such <UNK> as an old chinese folk <UNK> who makes her invisible with some magic <UNK> and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over manhattan if these <UNK> sound too fantastic for you how about something more <UNK> like an affair with a <UNK> player br br i was never quite sure of what this mixed up <UNK> was trying to say there are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the <UNK> a really preposterous touch of <UNK> br br rent <UNK> and <UNK> instead a superbly well done film that <UNK> in combining comedy with a serious consideration of <UNK> and morals or go back to annie hall or manhattan
<START> christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick <UNK> <UNK> although a little bit loose on information proves itself worthy of a true gory classic a little less glossy than recent us horrors <UNK> horror remake house of wax remake this dark and gruesome tale follows kate <UNK> <UNK> through the <UNK> of underground <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as she and a number of others along the way try and flee a murderous <UNK> though some bad reviews have <UNK> this film i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that <UNK> truly does live up to its name it delivers fast paced gory action more or less from the beginning sometimes too fast as the story is <UNK> in some areas but with a perfect location and the best character reaction at the end i've seen in a while <UNK> delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares
<START> this is one of the better classic edgar wallace movies from the german series it features all <UNK> for a highly enjoyable wallace crime <UNK> movie way back from the <UNK> although his <UNK> mr kinski is missing you still have young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> starring once again as the typical clever american <UNK> you have young <UNK> <UNK> in his best and just as well typical role ever the cool sophisticated british butler and you have not so young anymore <UNK> as the <UNK> yet very <UNK> ironic and thus highly entertaining police investigator furthermore you'll get offered a <UNK> and very campy <UNK> <UNK> behind a frog mask hence the movie's title you'll get a crazed out swinging soundtrack classic b movie action scenes partly filmed out off the <UNK> perspectives please remind the time of its origin yelling scream queens and on and on all those ingredients get <UNK> well up in a sweet <UNK> cocktail of pure german edgar wallace <UNK> highly recommended
<START> you can call this one a flop and that's a very big one too quality isn't associated with the words national lampoon but at least the vacation and animal house entries were fun but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that i've watched ugh the three piece story <UNK> attempts to parody the clichés and stereotypes that <UNK> hollywood genre films which turns out to be completely unfunny and <UNK> <UNK> br br growing yourself jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do that's life as jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one br br talk about <UNK> boring and stiff there only real interest is the small performance of the lovely diane lane the satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it the silly humour is strained flat and particularly senseless peter <UNK> keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> along in her role br br success <UNK> after just finishing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some <UNK> by the <UNK> company <UNK> for <UNK> she becomes interested in the <UNK> industry and virtually works her way to the <UNK> top br br probably the best one of the three but the competition wasn't too great the gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power <UNK> tone but still they do feel more tacky and forced the idea had something promising and inventive to build on but the <UNK> pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue don't do it any <UNK> at all the humour tries but more often doesn't come off despite the <UNK> the <UNK> ann <UNK> is pretty cold and manipulative throughout well after the painful ordeal and likes to <UNK> bare it all quite a bit even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full <UNK> for the opening half of the story popping up in amusing minor cameos <UNK> from dick <UNK> mary <UNK> olympia dukakis fred <UNK> robert <UNK> and a favourite turn by joe <UNK> br br <UNK> a serial killer who leaves copies of his <UNK> <UNK> behind after each murder is being <UNK> down by an <UNK> naive rookie cop and his old <UNK> partner however the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go when the pair encounter one situation after another br br stupid oh yeah sure if you're going to spoof something extremely over the top make sure laughter will stream off it obviously they forgot that even at its 30 minutes running boy does it drag <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mock performance got rather overbearing with a <UNK> richard widmark doing very little as his partner christopher lloyd <UNK> the role of serial killer but his <UNK> <UNK> and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads elisha cook jr <UNK> <UNK> and harry <UNK> appear when the jokes come they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its <UNK> of making fun of these cop clichés br br in all the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as <UNK> and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless only one or two few gags make it out each segment but really there's too many cheap <UNK> or plain misses which stick in your head this is because it virtually becomes what it's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story it loses sight the performances range from hot to cold but who can't deny the embarrassment that's felt on most of their faces director bob <UNK> first taste is a vapid one for growing yourself but success <UNK> showed some minor <UNK> of mild <UNK> henry <UNK> does a <UNK> jaded job on <UNK> rick <UNK> vividly crass drawings that opens the film are neatly <UNK> and go on to set the style and mood br br this low brow comedy <UNK> it by <UNK> it with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos but really is it worth going through this <UNK> lame and restless get up just to spot them well that's up to you
<START> the united states was still fighting world war ii the movie was released in between <UNK> day and <UNK> day any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where <UNK> american soldiers beat the enemy or americans in general were singing and dancing technicolor musicals were what america <UNK> on in the depressing days when everything was <UNK> most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time <UNK> the next musical number i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970 depressing how quickly we forget br br this film could've been called the search for jose iturbi but now everyone wonders why allow me to explain from <UNK> his arrival in america until his death in 1980 iturbi was one of the finest <UNK> to grace a concert stage he agreed to do a few movies in 1942 but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time not only an excellent <UNK> but a successful conductor as well iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years br br the scene where iturbi and 17 other <UNK> play one of <UNK> <UNK> was planned early on and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other <UNK> were all children joe <UNK> who produced that movie many other mgm musicals credited iturbi with interesting america's youth in classical music <UNK> wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time everyone wanted iturbi back then the joke among soldiers was that <UNK> meant get iturbi he did a lot of <UNK> at military <UNK> br br gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years kelly was already well known as a dancer but iturbi had by then been a world wide sensation for 20 years br br and as to the lack of a plot americans didn't need plot they were tired of war they were sick with fear for their loved ones and worried about the future they needed happiness and hope and the <UNK> that things would work out fine in the end they needed music and smiles and joy and romance this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed br br enough <UNK> mouse dancing aside the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them <UNK> <UNK> the other's music br br if you have any interest in jose iturbi the <UNK> who <UNK> more of america than de <UNK> cortez and de leon put together please drop by my website www <UNK> com where you can find a plot summary <UNK> from movie reviews of the day and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940's as well as a biography and <UNK> of iturbi br br <UNK>
<START> i can't believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdb br br this disney documentary is nothing but a <UNK> planet earth <UNK> now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series i just paid 8 75 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voice over and 90 seconds of <UNK> that i don't believe were in planet earth br br but the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a <UNK> for <UNK> change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar <UNK> demise they show his <UNK> grown significantly a year later and <UNK> some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown <UNK> impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earth br br i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life
<START> certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date and the rest of the cast perform beautifully christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked a story of ultimate greed that <UNK> is <UNK> against a <UNK> innocence and love this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets rockets and revenge the location of mexico city adds a feel of <UNK> and corruption which in itself is an eye opener all in all a truly gripping film from beginning to end highly recommended
<START> <UNK> a <UNK> that's one way to describe keep the river on your right a modern cannibal tale this film follows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who in his late 70s went on a journey back to the places he spent time as a <UNK> field <UNK> over 40 years ago first to west <UNK> and then <UNK> <UNK> is a full <UNK> character a gay jewish artist <UNK> who <UNK> out a living on a cruise ship teaching <UNK> tourists about the cultures he has come to have a deep respect and understanding for author of several books <UNK> his time with both the <UNK> people of west <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> has been haunted by what happened in his time in these places and how intimate his connection and relationships had become yet <UNK> constant wonder and appreciation for the places he got to know is admirable and a real pleasure to watch one can only hope to ever achieve and retain such <UNK> themselves br br <UNK> makes a compelling subject for study as the experiences he faced in <UNK> himself in these two <UNK> societies has left him <UNK> changed this film challenges the notions of morality and <UNK> e g nudity homosexuality <UNK> watch for the graphic <UNK> scene when <UNK> as to why he engaged in some of the local practices that others would morally <UNK> his non <UNK> nature asks why not who is to say the way of other cultures is right or wrong this little sleeper is a must watch for not only national <UNK> types but also those interested in the art of documentary making this film shows what can be done shot on video the editing provides a quiet revelation of <UNK> life that leaves you watching in fascination at times he <UNK> at being pushed by the film crew to make the emotional journey back especially considering his age and physical <UNK> we can be but grateful that <UNK> allowed the tables to be turned on himself perhaps <UNK> with the desire to understand humanity and one's place in the world the filmmakers provide some moments of critical balance presenting for example one <UNK> who believes that <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> of homosexuality in this case based on his personal interests that said you can't decide when to stop being shocked and when to take this man home for a <UNK> move over river queen this is the best river ride i've taken in a while
<START> if i remember ira gershwin the <UNK> and brother of george offered the gershwin <UNK> for this film and it was <UNK> up by the producers in many respects it was a typical 50's movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by <UNK> <UNK> with a lot of help from gene kelly br br the <UNK> were of course among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but in my opinion george himself was among the greatest of all american <UNK> period gene kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical one guess as to the other and i don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt but i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation oscar <UNK> was a noted personality in his time and as an actual friend of george gershwin he had to be in this film he was a talented <UNK> and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and <UNK> and here as always he plays himself br br leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french <UNK> type a talented dancer she was never a real beauty george <UNK> who plays the part of maurice <UNK> <UNK> i mean <UNK> <UNK> was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french <UNK> even if a little too young for the part br br <UNK> <UNK> voice is <UNK> here but <UNK> has much the better vocal equipment though gene was better cast elsewhere as obviously in <UNK> in the rain where his character is much more <UNK> even here he shows himself to be something of a <UNK> at times he was not for nothing cast as the original <UNK> joey in pal joey the broadway musical i was not so enchanted with his i got rhythm scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion br br i also found nina <UNK> character milo to be rather irritating br br but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french <UNK> <UNK> br br i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar as struggling artists and i don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but on balance the gershwin music is very well served in this film br br the dvd is well done with fine clear graphics when they are supposed to be and the <UNK> sound is good but a <UNK> shallow
<START> this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud in other places i have read complaints about racism and <UNK> from <UNK> politically correct <UNK> there is neither here unless you define <UNK> as a woman as housewife and racism as a family <UNK> a colored maid br br the lines are hilarious and all the leads have never been better <UNK> douglas is especially brilliant br br if you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house you will be <UNK> to know that no matter how <UNK> the process no matter how much a <UNK> among wolves you may feel you are not alone
<START> who me no i'm not kidding that's what it really says on the video case br br plot short version pretty woman stands around smiling this for some reason makes all men kill each other br br find ariel where's ariel can't find ariel she's right behind you you idiot br br most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said looks like br br a bunch of corny actors playing mostly <UNK> come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly then they get knocked off in the same way every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance perhaps it was a drawing of <UNK> to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check the alien virus <UNK> <UNK> witch <UNK> seems physically <UNK> and doesn't do a thing why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her <UNK> vampire routine actually it would've been more interesting if she had been a vampire or doing more than just standing around looking at people which is all she ever does this is enough to make all the men kill each other go figure br br this isn't really a space flick there are far more shots of the old western trail 1950's easy rider trail film <UNK> night club scene even a <UNK> on the beach in fantasy land none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense the night club scene is in black and white of course worked with the wizard of oz doesn't work so well here this is probably a good thing as those few shots they do show of space are <UNK> silly you will probably cry during those moments especially upon seeing that <UNK> space ship which looks about three <UNK> long br br nothing is felt for any of the characters not because they are <UNK> or have no personality but because they are in serious need of acting lessons except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss probably by being in this work br br this is one of those movies that when viewed with friends is going to cause some extremely loud <UNK> especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one liners including the line about french kissing a meteor did i hear that right perhaps not br br the original virtual reality girls get killed which means nothing as they are not even real to begin with well the other characters aren't either but that's beside the point haha br br what's kind of funny is that the scene that <UNK> the video case is some sort of skull horror alien looking thing green <UNK> added on top of that to give it more of a uh green look which is actually the <UNK> after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else <UNK> br br another odd deal i noticed whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy everything becomes highly <UNK> i don't mean a little <UNK> i mean huge <UNK> about 1 <UNK> the size of the screen wow
<START> i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free <UNK> it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i'll check it out br br oh man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity br br cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was <UNK> and it became a cult classic and a franchise br br 2 10
<START> awful absolutely awful no plot no point no end it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch every day i'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it i'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like <UNK> roger i'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one br br
<START> <UNK> pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which <UNK> marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest soon the inmates find a diary of a previous <UNK> behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell from here on everything deals with <UNK> the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison that leads to some <UNK> on the way out of the cell into the unknown light br br honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast the kills are raw and eerie its doesn't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in <UNK> <UNK> has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with <UNK> <UNK> at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger when the retarded boy <UNK> his fingers and is <UNK> to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre <UNK> do i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale several elements like the visitor with the camera the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don't fit tight in the story anyway i'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director <UNK> although its a turn off to see he's is doing a hollywood remake of one missed call which was worn off and useless already in the miike version
<START> in the wake of lock stock and two smoking <UNK> the british film industry rapidly became <UNK> with bad gangster films in the late <UNK> early <UNK> that seem even more desperate today than they did then in one of the all time great cases of <UNK> from <UNK> the producers of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the quote 'the best film of the <UNK> from one review all over the ads while <UNK> the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because at the time of writing it was the only film that had been released in 2000 looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it ever got made <UNK> a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  rhys <UNK> <UNK> frost nick <UNK> and joseph <UNK>  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james <UNK> novel that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no one really knows what it is or perhaps simply don't think it matters something to do with <UNK> businessman being set up with steven <UNK> homicidal russian crime lord in a money <UNK> or investment scheme it's never clear which because no one ever asks by <UNK> crooked irish <UNK> who expects the russians to kill off <UNK> so he can take over his failing company things get increasingly confused and <UNK> from there on <UNK> <UNK> between shouting about how terrible his life is while <UNK> visits to the <UNK> clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> russian <UNK> <UNK> keeps on saying <UNK> and francis drake and <UNK> does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn't mean he's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts br br when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani <UNK> you know a film is in deep trouble with <UNK> standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that <UNK> from john barry <UNK> to <UNK> music to <UNK> <UNK> spaghetti western on a <UNK> budget it fails completely in the cool stakes it's aiming for and ends up in a curious <UNK> but almost plot less <UNK> all its own sitting there like a joke shop dog turd
<START> basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child at the <UNK> agency they meet a mouse stuart and they decide to adopt him if you think that this is stupid hold it because it's getting worse br br stuart arrives to his new home where he is treated like a human child spare me the rest is pretty much the usual cliché about family problems jealousy from the elder brother and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a happy family boring and worn out as this is it is also shown in the most blunt and <UNK> way br br i don't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché or he was just trying to fill in minutes but he only <UNK> the cliché from boring to <UNK> br br then why i gave a 3 and not a zero because of the family cat who loves stuart as much as the brother and because of some funny <UNK> where stuart makes good use of his small size br br on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if a stuart was a pet and not a sibling b it had kept to the funny <UNK> like stuart trying to <UNK> the cat and had left out boring clichés which don't even match with anything else
<START> yokai monsters <UNK> <UNK> yokai <UNK> 2005 a movie about yokai or traditional japanese monsters of <UNK> it is <UNK> known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade br br the yokai of the first installment include the <UNK> freak <UNK> water <UNK> a living <UNK> a woman whose <UNK> can grow extremely gigantic a woman with a second face on the back of her head a dwarf priest with an enormous <UNK> like <UNK> so on br br these sorts of whimsical monsters <UNK> not only from fairy <UNK> but from a type of summer entertainment of the <UNK> era comparable to today's halloween haunted houses or the freak shows of <UNK> but with exclusively phony freaks ghosts <UNK> monsters dancing one headed <UNK> were <UNK> up to create chills during the hot <UNK> the <UNK> woman such were <UNK> by tricks or <UNK> based on monsters depicted in medieval <UNK> if their design for the movie is a bit simple <UNK> this makes them all the more representative of what historically was <UNK> for summer chills br br these rather endearing monsters have to face off destroy an ancient <UNK> vampire demon who has come to japan disguised himself as a samurai lord despite that some of the japanese <UNK> are a bit goofy too many of the costumes <UNK> more than masks without even moving lips as they speak it is all played very poker faced is very charming it has some beautiful cinematography much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade viewed in the right mood or with the right friends it is exciting moving touching br br <UNK> <UNK> also directed the famed lone wolf <UNK> white heaven hell 1974 and was the special fx director for the excellent <UNK> trilogy the yokai monsters series is not the equal of <UNK> at its best but the yokai are nevertheless great fun the first miike movie which is the most child oriented of his family films with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> more serious though none too severe for young viewers
<START> ok i adore this film i will credit this movie alone for making me such a die hard horror fanatic i could never watch this movie alone i've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres on its viewers incredible masterpiece horrible psychological stuff scares the pants off me oh bless their hearts whoever made this awesome film i love it i thought the whole film was decent and interesting this movie is so scary this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough but what always got me was <UNK> fabulous acting best horror film ever nothing can ever be this scary again halloween viewing at its <UNK>
<START> a quite good film version of the novel though at the beginning a little bit lengthy fortunately there are a few funny scenes from time to time this movie is surely not for the main stream audience but for fans of italian or portuguese cinema a must see also for mastroianni fans
<START> is this the same kim <UNK> <UNK> who directed the poignant life <UNK> <UNK> of spring summer fall winter and spring the same kim <UNK> <UNK> who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of 3 iron the same kim <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> us with the <UNK> tragedy of the coast guard and made us <UNK> about the <UNK> of <UNK> teenage prostitution before returning to his almost <UNK> nature <UNK> to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in <UNK> girl i just cannot seem to find him in this film br br oh sure <UNK> nature <UNK> is still present the film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on the surface of calm waters yes it's kim <UNK> <UNK> all right kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the dvd's special features but i'm not sure anymore what that means after viewing this <UNK> presentation br br what is beautiful about angry <UNK> mouthed prostitutes <UNK> violent and <UNK> mouthed <UNK> a <UNK> mute <UNK> explicit animal torture sequences of self <UNK> and a pace that <UNK> <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> and mindless brutality these are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly <UNK> and ultimately pointless film if it is based on a fable or intended as a <UNK> or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material it has been <UNK> compared to audition by japanese director takashi miike much to <UNK> satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors <UNK> <UNK> and kim <UNK> <UNK> i find little reason to recommend this film i have not seen audition but i doubt it would alter in any way my view of the <UNK> its violence is pornographic and <UNK> sadistic its sex is not pornographic but <UNK> and <UNK> characters behave on irritating <UNK> because there is no plot its point is either non existent or i will admit lost amidst korean cultural quirks that i fail to understand br br the only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic kim fog <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> slowly across a <UNK> lake <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the background and an imaginative and playful use of color at times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big kim <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> room some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute <UNK> played by <UNK> and the pleasantly odd use of <UNK> are intriguing but as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities one hopes that kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more
<START> batman mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video dvd movie to be released minor spoilers ahead the plot revolves around a new <UNK> the batwoman who seems to be personally involved for whatever reason in stopping a major arms <UNK> br br although the movie is interesting enough it's not as good as <UNK> of the phantasm ' <UNK> zero ' or <UNK> of the joker ' the main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did at the end of this movie we don't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others especially <UNK> zero ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us even the batwoman is not really a <UNK> character as mr freeze or phantasm were not only that but <UNK> alter ego seems so incredibly <UNK> and dull that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and <UNK> lies the main reason we don't get this special emotional appeal br br don't get me wrong i did find the movie enjoyable it does have its moments such as when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original <UNK> the animated series ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments br br if the <UNK> background was more interesting this movie would have been better than <UNK> of the <UNK> in my book but as it is now it's in 4th out of 4 br br as for the animation it's the same as the new batman <UNK> cartoon from the mid to late 1990's the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films but it's still good nonetheless br br i do recommend buying this dvd because despite its flaws it is enjoyable but just remember it's not as good as the other batman animated movies br br 7 10
<START> not as bad a film as i thought it would be br br it has a good cast nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors br br would like to see more of olivia d <UNK> in future projects maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy <UNK> d <UNK> br br also a good use of unseen locations such as <UNK> br br hopefully we will see more uk european co productions like this

<START> there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie they took a sleazy story miscast it <UNK> it <UNK> it it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story br br as badly as it fails as art it fails even worse as <UNK> who could have been the target market for this what age group what interest group br br someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie that i would pay to see br br i've seen thousands of bad movies and this ranks with sailor who fell from grace and <UNK> my choices as the three most <UNK> bad movies i've ever seen everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with <UNK> for all eternity br br i challenge you watch this movie and perform an academic exercise how could you take this and make it worse i can't think of one way
<START> jeremy brett is simply the best holmes ever <UNK> <UNK> out the great basil <UNK> of course and this is probably the best adaptation of a <UNK> doyle short story br br a length adaptation includes some new plot <UNK> that fit in well to the surrounding drama and <UNK> the hatred one feels for <UNK> br br excellent performances all round especially from robert hardy and both brett and <UNK> fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama
<START> have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before that happened to me with the young <UNK> the cover of the video box if you can find the video is extremely <UNK> i'd swear that the two women on the cover aren't even in the film br br anyway i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the <UNK> points of this film or it is simply pointless junk i'm heavily <UNK> toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie br br hmm plot a plot let's see there must be a plot around here somewhere nope i can't find it it's pretty much about some high school <UNK> acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago one of the female students has a crush on her teacher the teacher has a <UNK> wife whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg so he is <UNK> to the girl's advances br br there's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of <UNK> dancing our cat <UNK> was <UNK> by the dancing high school kids she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers <UNK> and <UNK> out on the dance floor it's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this <UNK> 1 10
<START> man this is a hard dvd to come by i could only find it on region 2 a spanish <UNK> and it was expensive br br was it worth it well yes not so much because it's a masterpiece of film making though directed by <UNK> <UNK> the credits on imdb com read robert but the dvd credits list <UNK> or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries elisha cook jr and thomas <UNK> but because my decade long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied br br essentially a respected but self contained engineer alan curtis has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a new york bar with two show tickets in his pocket a woman with a strange hat is on the <UNK> next to his and he <UNK> invites her to join him at the musical review she accepts a little <UNK> the <UNK> bartender gives them both the eye as they leave br br at the show the <UNK> star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and <UNK> <UNK> with anger the drummer in the band cook <UNK> at the silent lady but gets no response curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she won't give it and she doesn't want to know his if she'd been a <UNK> <UNK> she'd have said something about ships that pass in the night br br okay curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence the head police officer <UNK> turns him over to the da his only <UNK> is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember not the bartender not the <UNK> star not the cab driver al <UNK> not the drummer and since the lady herself has disappeared it's impossible to dig her up br br curtis is convicted and sentenced to die but inspector <UNK> has thought things over and decided <UNK> probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story he joins <UNK> loving secretary ella raines in re investigating the case <UNK> br br they visit the supposed witnesses again the ominous bartender is run over by a car perhaps accidentally so he's out of the picture the hot <UNK> <UNK> has left because the show closed and she's <UNK> and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway elisha cook jr is <UNK> by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group his <UNK> face assumes an expression which doesn't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous <UNK> insanity his <UNK> roll to the ceiling his mouth <UNK> his <UNK> becomes <UNK> i laughed out loud br br <UNK> performance is otherwise outstanding but all are professional enough thomas <UNK> is always reliable best performance though is probably by <UNK> tone he's the real murderer and he <UNK> his <UNK> he's reserved and artistic even when he <UNK> he's <UNK> i don't know how to put this precisely but tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part alan curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the <UNK> scale and belongs in a b picture br br i don't know why it's considered as classic it's really your basic murder mystery by <UNK> <UNK> not as good as some of his others but <UNK> direction is sensitive a man gets run over and his hat winds up in a <UNK> with water running around it his use of shadows is quietly effective br br glad i got it
<START> there can be no denying that <UNK> se <UNK> election in english is a well made and well thought out film the film uses numerous clever pieces of <UNK> all the time playing with <UNK> yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john <UNK> hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled 1992 and when hong kong films do settle down into <UNK> of telling the story from the <UNK> point of view they can sometimes <UNK> and just become merely <UNK> a good example being city on fire 1987 br br election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and <UNK> if that's the right word manner as well as the clever little <UNK> <UNK> of film making it's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the <UNK> say goes the second act is the <UNK> of the ancient <UNK> from china that tradition demands must be present during the <UNK> with the final third the aftermath of the <UNK> and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the <UNK> should and could be run needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and <UNK> whereas some are much larger and spectacular br br election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested this happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there's a secret meeting about the <UNK> between the <UNK> but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other <UNK> are having a pre election talk but the police show up and guess what you know br br once the film gets out of that <UNK> that i thought it would it uses a sacred <UNK> as a plot device to get everybody moving the <UNK> <UNK> some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it's been <UNK> another chase involving a <UNK> and a kung fu fight with a load of <UNK> weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like i said they are in a <UNK> manner where election really <UNK> is its attention to that fine detail when the <UNK> are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting they're all animals in <UNK> as that's how they behave on the outside when in conflict another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the <UNK> <UNK> using tea and not alcohol <UNK> themselves above other head gangsters who'd use <UNK> the long good friday and also <UNK> chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or <UNK> br br election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic <UNK> en scene as you look at what's going on some of the <UNK> settings and the clothing as well as the <UNK> of style that is <UNK> on as the search and chase for the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film <UNK> at chinese tradition in the process i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two <UNK> characters fishing and <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a <UNK> manner of course
<START> <UNK> parade is just one of several wonderfully <UNK> musicals that warner bros produced in the early 1930's to ward off the depression <UNK> street and the <UNK> series were also produced during this era and they made literally millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while and enjoy themselves br br while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell ruby keeler and dick powell only <UNK> parade had the <UNK> james cagney almost ten years prior to his most well known musical <UNK> <UNK> dandy here he dances in that most original of dance styles with his arms usually <UNK> at his side and his legs doing all types of <UNK> and kicks it's easy to see that he is enjoying himself and that makes us enjoy him all the more br br while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film they are well worth the wait i believe that this film was made just prior to the <UNK> of the production code so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit <UNK> but it's all in fun br br it doesn't matter what the plot of the film is just know that there are plenty of laughs and a <UNK> cast besides those already mentioned guy <UNK> is at his <UNK> best here br br 7 out of 10
<START> i'm an <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and was thus expecting to enjoy this film after watching it however i honestly believe that i could have made a better documentary myself its arguments appear to have only four <UNK> sources despite his being listed in the credits on imdb i didn't see richard <UNK> anywhere it's edited together <UNK> with laughably amateurish computer effects and it doesn't make even the slightest attempt to appear <UNK> the narration is <UNK> throughout with a <UNK> almost adolescent anti christian sentiment ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir i e me though there is some interesting discussion of the <UNK> of jesus the movie hits an unbearable <UNK> when it begins to <UNK> heavily on the christian school which the director attended as a child an institution which apparently <UNK> him badly psychologically as it <UNK> him to this day br br though <UNK> obviously had a low budget there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of christianity there's certainly a <UNK> of <UNK> minded religious documentaries on the market and this film could have helped fill the void instead the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage which in the end appears to be some sort of <UNK> exercise for him it's too bad that his christian upbringing traumatized him but he <UNK> subject an audience to his <UNK> <UNK>
<START> it's got christopher lee it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make <UNK> noises as letters appear on the screen it's got <UNK> <UNK> that not only glow in the dark but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> noises it's got <UNK> evil aliens disguised as nuns <UNK> waves <UNK> exploding cars exploding coffee machines and as a climax the entire planet blows up how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly mind numbingly dull the answer my friend is because 90 of this movie is made up of establishing shots most of them involving long tracks pans or <UNK> in <UNK> or occasionally all three that do nothing except give the crew something to do there are endless shots of our protagonists driving getting in and out of cars driving again walking around looking at stuff getting in cars and driving i just sat there watching endless parade of <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> say something please somebody just say something do something anything br br the dialogue when it does come is terrible br br maybe their minutes are <UNK> on a different scale than <UNK> was a typically meaningless line the script <UNK> in the destruction of the world by stock footage justified in this speech from lee as the head alien br br the planet earth has <UNK> an over abundance of <UNK> they are <UNK> the universe all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed br br this is is <UNK> sf script writing this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds it is and i collect such things the most god awful line from an english language sf movie since buster <UNK> retired it <UNK> belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters br br lee who always struck me as a smart useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of <UNK> i don't blame him
<START> cause it's crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and <UNK> the movie maker and say why horrible camera work count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible i'd bet 10 they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the <UNK> were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainment stare at a wall
<START> there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is it simply defies description something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the <UNK> mouth which kills them or turns them into zombies the whole thing is so <UNK> that it's stunning there's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet i'm not making this stuff up the computer also controls things like cars even though there's nothing <UNK> the computer with the vehicle br br the film is total trash surreal bad trash spectacularly one of a kind bad trash there's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there which aren't very hot or erotic there's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a <UNK> which had me rolling on the floor br br definitely one of the worst movies ever made up there with the equally wretched direct to home video <UNK> or boogeyman ii both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer <UNK> at least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on
<START> <UNK> and others have pretty much nailed this shore leave is really <UNK> first attempt at lightweight sci fi which they would later perfect with the classic trouble with <UNK> it gave both the crew of the enterprise and its tv viewers a needed <UNK> from the universe threatening consequences of for example the <UNK> <UNK> br br looking for a place to chill out for a while the enterprise happens across a seemingly <UNK> m class planet and sends an <UNK> team down to take a closer look soon enough all kinds of <UNK> begin to take place some seemingly <UNK> but it all seems a <UNK> of human emotional <UNK> played out in a weird blend of fantastic mystery mccoy has gone through the looking glass psychological thriller kirk is stalked by an <UNK> bully from his past and romantic comedy no comment br br <UNK> was the least <UNK> of all of the series in the trek franchise so it is easy to forget how many episodes in the first season focused on heavy handed potentially <UNK> drama unlike later series franchise writers <UNK> production team was not afraid to literally go where no tv series had gone before and shore leave despite its occasional problems is an example my only criticism of this episode is that the cast particularly shatner ironic given his legendary sense of humor didn't seem to know how to handle this new <UNK> on <UNK> themes the last scene is possibly one of the worst scenes i can remember from the entire <UNK> run both <UNK> and in terms of acting br br <UNK> said my recommendation see it while watching the entire first season as it was meant to be seen it order
<START> this film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success trying to be ever <UNK> mobile working hard so that he could be proud of <UNK> his own home he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home br br his was <UNK> with her at first going to the dance class just to <UNK> her but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing it eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death there is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the <UNK> br br there is also revelations of various characters including the girl he initially admired giving some depth to them by showing their <UNK> past and their struggle to overcome it br br the dancing was also engaging with the big competition at the end but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it instead there are <UNK> revelations and redemption br br all these makes it a moving and fun film to watch
<START> i very much enjoyed the revolution will not be <UNK> it gave me once again a positive feeling about the power of people to decide for themselves how they wish to be <UNK> br br it is unfortunate that in <UNK> the twenty percent of wealthy citizens have made all of the decisions for the <UNK> percent of the poor for decades if not centuries however when their coup failed after the <UNK> government <UNK> the supreme court and the <UNK> and the <UNK> and the <UNK> boards and all civil rights no one took the <UNK> out behind a <UNK> somewhere and shot them they haven't even gone to jail the major <UNK> are living in florida carrying on and the protection that they had was the <UNK> <UNK> passed by a large majority of the <UNK> people it is not only history that bites democracy can give you one hell of a <UNK> if you let it loose and in <UNK> it is loose
<START> as interesting as a sheet of cardboard this <UNK> period piece has little going for it it's overly <UNK> and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real life characters must have felt as they <UNK> the french <UNK> <UNK> hand of justice eric rohmer at <UNK> it shows
<START> this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general <UNK> <UNK> of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally <UNK> the three girls that play <UNK> friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
<START> pros akshay <UNK> performance is it just me or does this guy always manages to <UNK> <UNK> in their movies together some touching scenes in the 2nd half br br cons the whole 1st hour the jokes were flat to say the least every scene involving <UNK> <UNK> major stupidity in <UNK> decision making let me get this straight he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way that will likely ruin their relationship beyond <UNK> is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth wtf he considers <UNK> is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer but thinks insulting him will make him stronger am i the only one who doesn't see the logic here easily the movie's biggest flaw br br akshay becoming a stunt man <UNK> we're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in <UNK> but when the time arrives to support himself and his pregnant wife he becomes a stunt man lol how <UNK> actually <UNK> for a normal job in <UNK> field or heck anywhere else where <UNK> life isn't in danger this is some incredibly dumb writing br br the ending i hate this sort of melodramatic crap everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for <UNK> character which i couldn't the entire thing reminded me a little too much of <UNK> in <UNK> which i hate this please feel sorry for the guy with the illness crap has run its course i felt more like <UNK> than sympathy for the old man couldn't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast <UNK> the whole thing br br <UNK> <UNK> is just too dumb to be called a good movie its obvious director <UNK> shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile <UNK> and <UNK> who could care less about a story that actually makes sense give 'em some decent song <UNK> fancy outfits plenty of <UNK> filled scenes and some star power and they'll happily lap up crap like this
<START> i truly <UNK> this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake <UNK> man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the <UNK> that <UNK> with this <UNK>
<START> it's true that danny <UNK> the unseen is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades but that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film on the contrary my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80's shock feature that mainly <UNK> from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little <UNK> town to shoot a documentary on the <UNK> festival but their hotel forgot to register their <UNK> in their search for a place to stay the trio runs into the <UNK> friendly but suspicious museum <UNK> ernest <UNK> who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion one by one the girls experience that <UNK> and his extremely <UNK> and <UNK> sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house the unseen can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse <UNK> of the horror classics psycho and the texas chainsaw massacre the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly <UNK> due to these two films like twisted family secrets in the <UNK> <UNK> crazed <UNK> killers and a very <UNK> treatment of <UNK> still i don't consider these to be negative remarks as the unseen is a completely <UNK> and <UNK> unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast director <UNK> attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house unseen like the title promised the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre sydney <UNK> <UNK> since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient <UNK> <UNK> in one flew over the <UNK> nest is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed also stephen <UNK> who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen gives away a tremendous performance as junior he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving the unseen is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70's exploitation and generally weird stuff
<START> yes even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice this show is pretty bad i didn't mind the first couple of shows but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show br br ryan you can have <UNK> she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television and she definitely wasn't the <UNK> girl around very media <UNK> but i doubt there's much more there br br i haven't really watched any of the shows since apart from the <UNK> re run on daytime tv i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as entertaining trash view it as something you can laugh over and don't have to think too hard about i don't watch <UNK> its like reality tv tired and clichéd but you have to think too much anyway while watching br br a couple of thoughts on some reasons <UNK> going on the show at the very first 'the woman tell all woman such as amy who had a lot of class about her commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her hey amy how about joining a club getting a <UNK> doing charity work changing your job to one where you meet more guys <UNK> all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner br br amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting the perfect man' clue to ladies he doesn't exist there are however many great guys out there that would make great husbands some who may be right for you they may not earn six figures a year or be a <UNK> junior look alike but they are great guys all the same the <UNK> of woman on this show is quite unbelievable im still a <UNK> at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their <UNK> as they got older and more realistic about their future partner this show is proving otherwise br br overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun nothing is <UNK> more between the couples than a simple night out the bachelor sadly takes itself way too seriously
<START> loved this film real people great acting humour unpredictable the characters were believable and you really connected with them if you're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other this would be a good choice
<START> this might contain a spoiler so beware br br if it had been 200 000 thousand or two million people does it make a difference sometimes i get so angry at the apparent <UNK> of a small number of strangely very loud americans but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not <UNK> or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone god help us for what we have done after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans and the indifference to the horrors of <UNK> a race you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us how then can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to <UNK> our will we are <UNK> and <UNK> and i am ashamed for this i feel sorrow for the people affected they deserve justice and their homes back if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety i don't want it i <UNK> these actions and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of <UNK> no one is above the law i want my country back and so do the <UNK> <UNK> regardless of what people post from the <UNK> of their computers no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their <UNK> for some bombs and <UNK> we can't stand to be stuck in traffic let alone <UNK> and <UNK> removed from our homes <UNK> one of us brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around don't buy into the <UNK> that a simpler more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed and <UNK> when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and <UNK> of 2000 we turn away from the basic human rights and <UNK> of all men
<START> the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms <UNK> was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer br br otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies <UNK> are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are <UNK> trying to de <UNK> their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
<START> i actually like this movie even though i don't fancy james belushi very much in this movie you can actually see several big names on the rise linda hamilton and <UNK> cox namely <UNK> was already big of course the plot in this movie is simple its just like that <UNK> door movie it however was told in a light hearted manner and i like the comedy moments in it it made me trying to <UNK> my own important moments in live <UNK> what if i've taken that girl out for a movie and not the other etc it tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change it also reminds us to be careful what we wish for life is not always as good on the other side as we think maybe what we have now is the best for us all things considered
<START> up until the last 20 minutes i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan's worst movie <UNK> his pre 1978 work which i am not familiar with the final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense indeed one of the highlights of chan's career but to get to it you have to sit through a lot of comedy that might <UNK> five year olds oh look someone threw a <UNK> at that guy's face and endless football scenes not to mention the dubbing which includes the line how can i turn it off it's not a tap watch to find out what it refers to dragon lord is worth renting for the final fight alone but the rest of the movie is only for jackie <UNK> and even then only for those who've already seen at least 15 of his other movies
<START> <UNK> in a horror thriller i had to see this i was pleasantly surprised br br the plot is told in flashback mode and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre <UNK> i can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie sorry just know that if you decide to watch it you'll be in the very least surprised br br all the main players are very good bill paxton did a great job directing those kids and his acting is awesome <UNK> acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly br br this movie challenges you to think is dad crazy is there a god do demons exist how far would you go to right a wrong and what is right anyway i'm still thinking br br and thus i recommend <UNK> 7 10 and this is one of those movies that deserves and <UNK> a second or even third viewing
<START> this two part tv mini series isn't as good as the original from 1966 but it's solid the original <UNK> from a huge number of things it was all in black and white it had a great jazz score and it was filmed at the real locations including the home of the doomed clutter family that was important because in the book and in the original movie the home is very much a character itself br br this remake was filmed in canada which i guess <UNK> okay for kansas the story tries to be as sympathetic to perry as it <UNK> to and eric roberts plays him as a somewhat <UNK> person his homosexuality barely hidden the <UNK> take by roberts doesn't quite work in the end though because it's hard to believe that his version of perry smith would just finally explode in a <UNK> of murder whereas robert <UNK> take on smith left you no doubt that his perry smith was an extremely dangerous character br br anthony <UNK> was excellent as the <UNK> big mouthed and ultimately cowardly dick <UNK> the brains of the outfit his performance <UNK> very well to scott <UNK> role in the original movie br br since this is a longer movie it allows more time to develop the clutter family and in this regard i think the 1996 movie has an advantage the <UNK> are just an outstanding decent family they've never <UNK> another soul and it is just inexplicable that such a decent family is ultimately <UNK> in such a horrifying way it still <UNK> my mind that after the <UNK> were locked in the bathroom that <UNK> clutter didn't force out the window so at least his children would have a chance to escape this movie has the thought occur to him but too late from what i read about the real home which is still standing the way the bathroom is <UNK> they could've opened the counter <UNK> and effectively <UNK> the door which would've forced the killers to blast their way in but it <UNK> bought time for some of the <UNK> to escape why the <UNK> didn't try this i have no idea br br fans of the book will recognize that this movie takes a lot of liberties with how the crime is committed but not too serious still it's distracting to viewers like me who have read tons about the case the actors playing the cops led by sam <UNK> and leo <UNK> are uniformly excellent much better i think as a group than the actors in the original movie they know that to secure the <UNK> around the <UNK> of both of them they have to get them to confess and the officers come to the interview <UNK> prepared they had already discovered the likely <UNK> the phony story of going to <UNK> scott and had <UNK> every <UNK> of it the officers then let smith <UNK> just walk into their trap <UNK> is a b s artist who figures he can convince anyone of anything and the officers <UNK> let him tell his cover story but when they lower the boom on him he <UNK> very quickly it's very well filmed and acted and very <UNK> to watch because the viewer naturally should <UNK> <UNK> in particular by this point a cowardly con man who needs the easily manipulated smith to do his killing for him supposedly <UNK> later stated that the real reason for the crime wasn't to steal money from the <UNK> but to rape nancy clutter at least she was <UNK> that <UNK> br br the actors playing the <UNK> are very good kevin <UNK> as <UNK> clutter in particular the story <UNK> deals with mrs <UNK> emotional problems most likely <UNK> depression and mrs clutter displays remarkable inner strength when she firmly and strongly demands that the killers leave her daughter alone from what i've read the <UNK> surviving family was particularly bothered by how bonnie clutter was portrayed in the book claiming it was entirely untrue but as an aside both of the killers related to the police how mr clutter asked them to not bother his wife because of her long illness capote might make up that fiction to make the character of bonnie more interesting but certainly the killers had no reason to <UNK> portray mrs clutter and no doubt much of the conversation in the book <UNK> in the movies is right off the taped <UNK> of the killers so it would've been nonsensical for <UNK> to have said that and not have it be true
<START> i finally watched these episodes in 2008 and i had to continually go back and <UNK> when they were actually produced they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of <UNK> bush or they are those weird eerie people that pay attention to things boo scary <UNK> frat bros <UNK> the white house dressed as <UNK> wielding <UNK> bush <UNK> <UNK> someone no wait he did sort of do that as <UNK> this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time but must now be considered as brilliant if spooky <UNK>
<START> the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing but sit tight because you are in for the ride of your life the concept is compelling with interesting devices <UNK> to tell the overall story there are fine performances all around with phillip seymour <UNK> being the best of the cast no surprise there ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well the direction by mr lumet is outstanding the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story but unlike the majority of trite films that <UNK> the landscape today this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product <UNK> you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth br br the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between <UNK> steve biko and editor don woods played <UNK> by <UNK> washington and kevin <UNK> while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on <UNK> death br br although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and <UNK> i found the second half about don woods struggle to have <UNK> story be heard around the world much more interesting
<START> curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didn't rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of <UNK> dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger <UNK> good and with all the flash backs and flash <UNK> i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy <UNK> performance wasn't too bad you can catch him in s w a t in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop anyway i would rate this as a 1 10 it only got a 1 because of <UNK> so so performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering <UNK> crimes avoid this one
<START> okay let me <UNK> a new word here <UNK> the fear of <UNK> relationships this is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by <UNK> audiences about some kind of <UNK> only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a <UNK> solution only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them <UNK> br br mark my words a few decades from now <UNK> is going to be just as big a faux <UNK> as <UNK> but guess who was too close minded to realize this right the first time the producers of this movie and so many like it why even make a ridiculously conservative and old fashioned type of movie like this <UNK> itself on being <UNK> open minded about <UNK> it completely <UNK> the fact that we live in an age where <UNK> is turning into <UNK> <UNK> which in turn in turning into swinging and <UNK> open your eyes people please br br this is a disappointing run of the mill chick flick but damn i gotta say heather graham is the <UNK> thing alive br br 3 out of 10
<START> the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it much like star trek that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot <UNK> <UNK> the show because of this a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive now it's time to do the same for the twilight zone br br while i have scored many episodes 10 this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad two people from <UNK> sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode after a while it's apparent that they are the only two people left on earth as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion usually the twist at the end makes the episode great this one killed it
<START> well astronaut steve west sits in a plastic space capsule commenting that you haven't lived until you've seen the sun through the rings of <UNK> all the while the obvious mid day <UNK> is <UNK> through the window when suddenly he has a nose bleed next west is back home in some secret hospital a melting <UNK> mass who goes <UNK> and causes a <UNK> nurse to run through a fake glass door apparently west gets stronger as he <UNK> which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> then this dopey army <UNK> who looks kind of like coleman francis director of many bad <UNK> tries to cover the info up but goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting he attacks a <UNK> old couple because he is melting he makes one terrible actress scream and <UNK> <UNK> for about 10 minutes because he is melting he is melting because he is melting the fx by the <UNK> rick baker are supposed to be the star here but they just look hokey the film is poorly shot and everything looks so dark and muddled that it's very difficult making out what's what not that it would help any <UNK> says who cut the cheese with this one <UNK> ps didn't you get any <UNK>
<START> i'm a cartoon you're an <UNK> what does that suppose to mean this plot could not be worse as a boy who's afraid of everything becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read when a cheaper and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of <UNK> even the talents of <UNK> culkin as the kid christopher lloyd as the so predictable that he's a the page master <UNK> could save this pointless film from the dull plot even the voices of whoopi goldberg patrick stewart even leonard <UNK> or the hollywood god of voices frank <UNK> as the cartoon characters don't save it ever i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies because the bland animation makes the film worse not <UNK> the dull plot
<START> what was steven seagal thinking i mean firstly i love seagal i love all his movies up to the mid <UNK> his early stuff is some of the best in the genre this however does not live up to its excellent name attack force with protagonist marshall <UNK> seagal would be expected to be a mindless action movie with seagal in typical one liner ass kicking form however what we get is a crime mystery <UNK> on a political thriller with little or no action seagal is always in shadows because of his weight i could not follow this story there's people who <UNK> to <UNK> when they take a drug what happened in this movie the dubbing of seagal is a disgrace a <UNK> and a shame why dub the man the story is terrible this got a 2 10 from me because of the scene where seagal asks for <UNK> despite having an army with him and an hilarious fight scene where seagal <UNK> his hands like a girl facing the camera revenge is a two way street seagal says in this movie well forget revenge steven you need redemption
<START> i <UNK> kept myself awake late last night watching this thing about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie no proper character development wait i'm not even sure they were characters set ups were hokey and inane and the <UNK> of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even <UNK> with alternate shots if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would sadly it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs br br it's just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood and now i waste my time even thinking about it
<START> film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar ok they're talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason still ok from time to time they even make you laugh interesting first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it but then things become worse <UNK> happening for a long time and then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other not ok disgusting by the way this part should be the top of the movie but it's everything except that movie has no point it's boring and sick br br the strangest thing is that here <UNK> <UNK> on fest film festival this movie was the most popular according to <UNK> of course before people watched it i even thought before watching <UNK> this might be interesting although it's a russian movie but god no
<START> the blob is a great horror movie not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly <UNK> flesh <UNK> title character but because it features a real societal message it is in many ways a feel good horror film the clever storyline is helped <UNK> by solid performances from the entire cast the two romantic leads steve mcqueen and <UNK> <UNK> bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings they are misunderstood but very well meaning young people and it's very easy to root for them br br this is a pro society movie and its juvenile <UNK> characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom not out of some <UNK> character flaw steve <UNK> drag racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings but quickly joins in <UNK> campaign to save the town from the <UNK> <UNK> once he sees <UNK> seriousness in this way a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism br br the <UNK> initial <UNK> of the kids' wild claims is proved wrong and once the threat is acknowledged by all all conflict within the society disappears this <UNK> of purpose and the <UNK> of the <UNK> teens becomes official when <UNK> <UNK> father breaks into the school to obtain the fire <UNK> needed to freeze the blob on any other day breaking into the school would be considered an act of <UNK> typical of a juvenile <UNK> on this particular day it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure at this turning point it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old br br this is an unusual film in that it <UNK> the perception of a generation gap but suggests that it is more imaginary than real and that given a real crisis people will naturally band together to <UNK> order the blob is a perfect <UNK> for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of night of the living dead 1968 br br much has been made of the film's cheap but innovative and effective visual effects they are undeniably clever a lot of the gravity <UNK> tricks we see the blob perform were achieved with <UNK> sets designed to be <UNK> the camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly locked down position the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that these scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned the <UNK> blob <UNK> very slowly and its action needed to be <UNK> up in a way this was similar to stop motion photography but <UNK> a blob of <UNK> rather than an <UNK> puppet even today the effects are startling and bizarre br br a very good film with an exploitative sounding title the blob is a must see
<START> the surprise <UNK> of this year's best animated feature race at the oscars it's an irish film by heart but it was co produced by <UNK> and brazil with i'm guessing animators working in all three countries the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory the character design is a little reminiscent of the french animated film <UNK> from a couple of years back with very simple characters with thick black <UNK> this film is not in black and white oh no what makes this film great is its use of color simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors i've ever seen the general design of the pictures is also a lot more <UNK> with characters who are basically <UNK> or <UNK> much of the film can be spent playing find the circle a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image all of these <UNK> designs have a purpose the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on <UNK> <UNK> the book of kells is a real <UNK> bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it the story of the film isn't especially deep but it's a pretty good fantasy tale brendan is a young boy in kells a city surrounded by enormous walls built by his uncle to keep out <UNK> a newcomer to kells brother <UNK> <UNK> brendan to take up <UNK> he also <UNK> him to do things like leave kells and explore the nearby forest within which lives a <UNK> bruno <UNK> provides a fantastic score almost as good as the one he did for <UNK> which i consider the very best of the year
<START> after watching the bodyguard last night i felt compelled to write a review of it br br this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera work it was beyond annoying the angles were all wrong it was impossible to see anything especially during the fight sequences the closeups were even horrible br br the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring he is approached by judy lee who is never quite straight with chiba lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her br br the story was decent and despite horrible dubbing this could have been a good movie given better direction and editing i'm sure this would have been a classic kung <UNK> movie as it is it's more like another cheesy 70's action movie br br note the opening sequence has a quote familiar to pulp fiction fans and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie br br rating 4 out of 10
<START> without <UNK> what was said above about this movie i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film the cast location and the work of the excellent director michael <UNK> etc it had a vague shadow of <UNK> look <UNK> about the storyline from the beginning a stay in different surroundings italy again to dim the <UNK> of loss or perhaps that's how i saw it so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country and i sat there and sat there and guess what nothing actually happens and i mean nothing you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head the <UNK> daughters <UNK> with the local <UNK> boys had great scope to take the movie in another direction the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a <UNK> and pointless exercise the fathers attempts at being <UNK> by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to <UNK> any guts to the story and went for <UNK> it down to a bare minimum to no effect when the credits started to roll unexpectedly you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish
<START> ah <UNK> the sci fi channel produces yeti another <UNK> movie i was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where as the survivors desperately searched for matches at least a half dozen fires burned  with no apparent reason  at various points of the <UNK> fire seemed to be a <UNK> theme throughout they searched corpses for <UNK> and matches and finally finding a box built a fire every day for apparently 12 but no one ever gathered wood then when the <UNK> <UNK> burned the bodies what did she use for an <UNK> i mean these guys were frozen  well maybe not despite the apparent low <UNK> everything the yeti ate <UNK> maybe it's just me but even in a totally unbelievable tale none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti or an <UNK> snowman until the very end if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable oh what did the prologue 1972 have to do with the remainder of the movie and the revolver warm enough to hold in his hand <UNK> up and wouldn't fire <UNK> a break well at least we have <UNK> <UNK> another <UNK> lovely canadian <UNK> and with little irony ed <UNK> as the coach br br well i might as well add the rabbit they ate despite it looking like chicken is not a <UNK> but a <UNK> now if it had been a <UNK> or a rat it would have been a <UNK> but it still looked like chicken and the writers missed a real chance to have someone note it tastes just like
<START> oh come on learn to have a little fun when i was a kid oh this movie was oscar worthy to me i thought it was absolutely hysterical one of the best movies i had seen br br now it's a little stupid but come on if you enjoyed excellent adventure you should most likely have fun with bogus journey this was the movie before dude where's my car only this one is actually funny like i said it's just a good time it shouldn't be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one you should like bogus journey it's just a funny movie with some memorable characters for your enjoyment only watch it let go and remember that it's a silly comedy that's all br br 7 10
<START> i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed the best bit was when stephen king was in it <UNK> john <UNK> cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud the film was was not as i imagined it after reading the book which was awesome i imagined it darker and a lot scarier if i was stephen i would be really mad br br i don't know why they changed the ending i thought the ending of the book was very good if you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would you br br book was so much better
<START> wow i can't believe just how bad zombie doom aka violent sh t 3 really is i'd heard the rumors read the reviews but had to make my mind up for myself well let me tell ya it blows the worst acting of any film ever made dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted inept and laughable gore fx no discernible plot cinematography that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder weapons props that are no joke made out of tin foil the list goes on and on br br three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of <UNK> run around with plastic and tin foil swords two of the <UNK> are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the tribe that's pretty much it br br honestly this is one of the worst films i've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too the budget had to be about 200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx which actually may not have been a bad idea there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog this film makes other no budget <UNK> like <UNK> lord of the living dead look like titanic some may rank <UNK> in the so bad it's good category and i guess if you're really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3k style i guess it could be looked at that way but not by me i hated pretty much everything about it if zombie doom or zombie 90 which is equally appalling and is included as a bonus on the shock o <UNK> release of <UNK> is <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> other works then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death there is one amusing kung fu battle in the latter half of the film and a lot of blood so i'll grant this one a very generous 3 10 do yourself a favor and skip this
<START> <UNK> is in my mind the greatest achievement of indian cinema the film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking the music the songs the sets the costumes the cinematography in fact every creative element is worthy of <UNK>
<START> the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite <UNK> by director <UNK> <UNK> in his film <UNK> 1985 too the problem here is ace director <UNK> <UNK> found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action thriller <UNK> <UNK> or an emotions rich heavy duty drama <UNK> <UNK> and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome if we ignore two of his <UNK> 2000 and <UNK> 2001 this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value therefore this film comes as a surprise as to what made this script <UNK> director going for half baked characterization of both of his protagonists amitabh bachchan and <UNK> as the film is getting over audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major <UNK> force in the complete narration therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self realization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family the revelation of <UNK> son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in <UNK> worked so effectively with <UNK> character that is not all there is more to it the whole <UNK> of life of an underworld don operating from abroad looks quite illogical his openly landing up at <UNK> from where he is suppose to be <UNK> as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable <UNK> a mediocre newcomer actor like <UNK> opposite mr bachchan is again not a good idea but nonetheless film has some plus points <UNK> <UNK> fine camera work two good fight sequences co <UNK> <UNK> ali <UNK> some light well acted scenes of akshay kumar in the <UNK> half <UNK> fast paced slick treatment and of course mr bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
<START> spoilers br br this is only the second pay per view i've given a perfect 10 the first being the 1991 royal <UNK> it was full of exciting matches that weren't memorable just <UNK> fun and that's why i love it br br the opening match between razor and <UNK> as well as <UNK> <UNK> vs marty <UNK> were the only low points they were ok matches but <UNK> deserved better in his final pay per view match these days a match like this would have run ins and a bigger climax for <UNK> first major <UNK> push and <UNK> fresh off a <UNK> title run could have had a better match with <UNK> but i don't think anyone really cared they just needed a <UNK> push on pay per view television br br irs and the kid were great as were michaels and perfect i wish perfect could have won but michaels lies down for no one notice how right after this he left the <UNK> so he wouldn't have to job to razor <UNK> hart had two great <UNK> with <UNK> notice how everyone's best match is against the hit man and then <UNK> their rivalry was a classic that's why that year's <UNK> of the year was a no <UNK> how often do you see two legends win <UNK> of the year this late in their careers br br the <UNK> heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever br br many say that the undertaker giant <UNK> match was a waste of time but i loved it remember what made the old <UNK> as in pre wwe great was the mix of <UNK> and freak show is there a soul out there who didn't like <UNK> br br the main event wasn't bad although nowhere near match of the year status they put lex <UNK> over well but made a wise choice in having <UNK> keep the belt he was the first <UNK> since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months nowadays heels are <UNK> all the time but from the beginning of the <UNK> through the <UNK> of the 90s if you <UNK> you missed a <UNK> title reign br br as an old school wrestling fan this one and <UNK> <UNK> are my favorites

<START> spoilers spoilers packed with memorable moments such as the quote above <UNK> by <UNK> deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water <UNK> and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn this is not a hollywood film there are virtually no special effects whatsoever the setting is extremely realistic and nothing at all is <UNK> or made pretty the city boys look like city boys and even the tough guy louis portrayed with <UNK> by burt reynolds is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip this is a perfect example of a what if film what if a few friends went river <UNK> in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives br br there is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship or lack thereof between rural and urban peoples when the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate this communication block is most <UNK> illustrated in the <UNK> <UNK> scene in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles <UNK> for them while drew and the obviously <UNK> and probably mentally <UNK> boy on the <UNK> are <UNK> with their guitar and <UNK> one of the best scenes in the film louis is having some difficulty buying the gas and bobby makes a comment about genetic <UNK> and how pathetic it all is when the boy turns away from drew who had offered to shake his hand after their <UNK> jam session bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react br br this is the kind of thing that we see in deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow this great scene where a lot of fun was had including the funniest <UNK> <UNK> scene until o brother where art <UNK> ended with everyone <UNK> unsure what to do around each other these people are <UNK> and <UNK> and they live by completely different rules of life the people that louis bobby drew and ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws and live by the rules of nature which do not include <UNK> <UNK> not kill confused by their awkward behavior the four friends set out on the river hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin br br spoilers when they are briefly separated from each other and ed and bobby run into the <UNK> beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant the <UNK> about the way that these people live which was established by the scene above comes into play to create the most tension during the scene i think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film namely the <UNK> and actual murders takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film there is no gratuitous violence here it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a <UNK> powerful effect br br the move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other the trip down the rest of the river after the assault which takes up the majority of the film delivers some spectacularly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not <UNK> you with so much happening that you become <UNK> it is surprisingly effective when we find out that ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the <UNK> brother in law is missing br br this is a very disturbing film which is a testament to its success because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit the <UNK> are the human i e more realistic version of the sub human <UNK> seen in childish but fairly similar films like <UNK> bait and <UNK> bait 2 neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like deliverance when we follow these four men through their <UNK> weekend in the woods the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we as individuals of the audience are really a fifth member of the team it's not often that a film is able to come across that way
<START> this was the third remake of sleeping with the <UNK> after <UNK> 1995 and <UNK> 1996 br br <UNK> was the only one which worked and was a better film br br <UNK> is directed by <UNK> <UNK> who sadly failed in their attempt here br br the story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too <UNK> and the climax too was disappointing br br direction is bad music is good br br <UNK> <UNK> his role of <UNK> strangely which also was a remake of <UNK> and looks too fat for the lead and is okay <UNK> is decent while <UNK> tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible <UNK> is too loud
<START> as the <UNK> came to a close king <UNK> adopted daughter went ahead and made a <UNK> <UNK> her show as coming to an end br br while miss <UNK> was <UNK> up i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old west br br so what does oprah do she takes famous people and puts them on her show what kind of famous people people who've suffered just like her except these people have lost more than their virginity they've suffered <UNK> faces true story missing limbs true story see end of paragraph and <UNK> abuse too many to count and somehow they come on the show and tell their story as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times <UNK> hamilton i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one which was october <UNK> 2003 don't tell me you have no hard feelings but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jackson's interview in 1993 after being accused of being a child <UNK> sadly mr jackson has since passed away but that one particular show told about michael's personal life something not many people knew about at the time br br <UNK> real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer <UNK> they seem to think she's like a personal jesus sometimes but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big and she's just showing off how rich she is br br i'm glad her shows going to end soon we need better television programs
<START> this is the who at their most powerful although before the <UNK> who's next which would provide <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from <UNK> <UNK> to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's br br <UNK> shows what being a front man is all about <UNK> steady as ever br br moon is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side <UNK> whilst having a bass drum head replaced br br <UNK> even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally br br considering they took to the stage at <UNK> no one in the crowd was asleep br br there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in <UNK> years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one
<START> i can't remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i haven't ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam <UNK> was my favorite actor these days i think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly buy steal <UNK> this series i think i would go to great <UNK> in order to see it again and <UNK> a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing
<START> a solid b movie br br i like jake <UNK> his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances i liked the relationship between the father and son i liked the family dynamics the wendigo looks silly but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer it's an <UNK> like see this is a psychological story not a freddy slash em up instant <UNK> flick watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine br br nice work
<START> somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like u f o troma and beneath them lie seduction cinema br br seduction is a direct to video production company that <UNK> in lesbian themed non hardcore erotic movies it has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star misty <UNK> i say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show masters of horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget s c efforts which forces the company to find a new identity but back in their glory days they released this film on a very <UNK> world br br the gorgeous misty <UNK> is forced to attend a <UNK> school at the request of a absent father at the school she meets her <UNK> hot room mate played by ruby <UNK> who immediately has designs on her but the <UNK> barbara <UNK> has other plans in typical s c style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances ms <UNK> appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views misty as a tasty meal and <UNK> caine makes a welcome though brief appearance as satan this is the sort of film that jess franco would <UNK> out in the 70s although this one does not have the hardcore sex that franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales and fans of that <UNK> work would be wise to give this one a go br br to me as a long time zero budget cinema fan and troma <UNK> i came across the seduction cinema films through their parody films <UNK> of the apes who wants to be a erotic <UNK> but i actually prefer their more original works you either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films for me the most obvious thing that <UNK> these no budget movies is a real sense of fun these low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland by the numbers studio efforts that load up the <UNK> br br if you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters featuring both of the <UNK> sisters are excellent choices to begin with this one is a fun fast paced film although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old and the dvd is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings a great behind the scenes <UNK> and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening i do recommend you pass on the <UNK> bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing
<START> this movie re wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it <UNK> criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i've seen it more times than i care to count and i still become <UNK> every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages
<START> i actually didn't start watching the show until it came on fx i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show's reruns were <UNK> so i decided to watch it i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t v i loved the show so much finally a show for everyone to enjoy i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not that 70s show that 70s show was hilarious smart and so real i think it was the best show ever made and i'm very sorry that it ended although i love this show i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and <UNK> leave the last season was just not right eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one
<START> anyone find it interesting that the <UNK> look strangely similar to the <UNK> <UNK> of h p <UNK> vintage hmmm br br great pair of episodes not referring to <UNK> <UNK> as most seem to do in the impossible planet and the satan pit br br also the link to <UNK> i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist era br br great suspense episodes <UNK> fear and faith elements the new team for these <UNK> are working great magic for tv br br this certainly creates new fears and <UNK> behind the <UNK> feelings not seen for many many years in this <UNK> of a superb bbc series pity it is confirmed by the bbc that <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> perhaps not <UNK> after end of series 2 o
<START> i was excited when i heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie the whole era 1980's southern california and subject matter drug and porn industry is intriguing to me i thought this would be a sure fire hit i was not thrilled with the choice of kilmer as holmes they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms i guess he sells tickets however i was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot i was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do i will admit that there were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act john holmes was there but he was also a <UNK> liar and worried about what would happen to his family and self if he talked to police about it in fact holmes never really <UNK> about what happened and the crime did go <UNK> so this was still really one big mystery a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on the person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of <UNK> and most of the principal characters are dead however there is no real storyline it is <UNK> <UNK> the script is light and the actors try to hard to <UNK> up paper thin lines by overacting the film gives no insight into holmes or the other people involved <UNK> character disappears for long stretches his girlfriend is dull the police are jokes even <UNK> tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial it is a very shallow piece and dare i say boring the director even tries to turn it into a love story which is nice unless you know anything about what a piece of trash john holmes really was perhaps a couple of viewings of <UNK> boogie nights might have helped here boogie nights was innovative and exciting in all regards this film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style even the music is out of place with <UNK> <UNK> being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980 then we have gordon <UNK> gordon <UNK> there could have been a great film based on this gruesome event but i have not seen it yet i have not seen even a decent one yet unless you consider the <UNK> jackson scene from boogie nights
<START> if you like othello you'll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play br br the film has a great cast with <UNK> <UNK> and shelley winters as the women in <UNK> life while <UNK> o'brien plays the <UNK> press agent br br a couple of the supporting players i particularly liked were <UNK> mitchell as the <UNK> reporter who finds an angle and joe <UNK> the 1940's answer to drew carey who plays the cop on the case br br great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout
<START> okay there are a ton of reviews here what can i possibly add br br i will try anyway br br the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything the sets <UNK> locations costumes are so beautiful and authentic the music is sweet the supporting cast is very well done one of my favorites is the narrator nephew played by roger <UNK> his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me david warner is also a totally believable bob <UNK> his is a difficult life but he remains positive and <UNK> br br the best part of course is george c scott as <UNK> scrooge some have said his portrayal too gruff i couldn't disagree more his <UNK> at the beginning while cold or harsh weren't out of character he is a terribly <UNK> man who's heart has been hardened by the <UNK> of life and his own lust for wealth br br during the flashbacks it's obvious that he isn't all gruff this is where we see that there is hope for him if he was totally gone his partner <UNK> would never have come for his sake in the first place and after all we are none of us past hoping i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say when scrooge looks in on his dance at his <UNK> with belle you see him smile <UNK> as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life with a grin on my face clive <UNK> was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film sometimes they get left on the editing room floor br br and finally his <UNK> is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it his <UNK> to his nephew fred so sincere so moving it is the spirit not only of christmas but of humanity itself the joy he brings to fred to his wife are so apparent and the line that gets me every time god forgive me for the time i've wasted br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although it br br was a horror movie which i don't prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dull br br not very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richards br br was again a pleasure for the eye but that's it we the four of us br br we're a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie and br br judge it yourself
<START> forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction carefully staying within hard aspects of the genre science not fantasy <UNK> <UNK> will love it while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary 1950s values <UNK> isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into <UNK> gardens a swimming pool and the ultimate home <UNK> <UNK> the robot a <UNK> dream <UNK> the captain after lunch and a <UNK> of the <UNK> abilities to <UNK> food and <UNK> waste br br also revealing to the 1950s <UNK> psychology <UNK> its head in the id explanation although <UNK> <UNK> it as an outdated concept there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the <UNK> perhaps most <UNK> is the post atomic fear that science is the enemy and arrogant scientists will <UNK> bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledge br br yet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci fi genre they aren't <UNK> or heroes but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a <UNK> <UNK> and honesty the good guys drive the flying <UNK> and the aliens are so long gone we don't even know what they looked like although their music er atmospheric <UNK> by <UNK> and louis <UNK> are remarkably futuristic today the views from <UNK> house are truly alien with <UNK> <UNK> and pink <UNK> the interior of the <UNK> is just this side of buck rogers there's a lot visually to like although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the <UNK> forbidden planet is a cerebral movie slow paced and talky it is working on many levels at once hard sci fi against space adventure philosophical against domestic br br there are many suburban touches in spite of all their space talk the soldiers are dressed for the golf course <UNK> fatal discovery is a humble educational facility a <UNK> the most interesting character is <UNK> daughter <UNK> having never seen a man she is <UNK> forward to the crew she's a post madonna teen who designs her own space age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits imagine christina <UNK> with a household <UNK> men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a <UNK> but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a <UNK> anne francis deserves better recognition for <UNK> the <UNK> with kisses alas we'll never know if she was working him as he suspects since the captain <UNK> and becomes a more interesting target for her attention she is the character who makes the important change in the film shocked that her father <UNK> the dead doc to the other <UNK> in his landing party she turns away from her father her home to leave with the sailors for earth it's this act of <UNK> of maturity that sends <UNK> id creature over the edge <UNK> destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the <UNK> br br maybe the <UNK> had teenage daughters too
<START> the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of <UNK> classic tale george c scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast his scrooge <UNK> with <UNK> until the very end of the movie then his character changes to one who is truly <UNK> the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the <UNK> of this film it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life
<START> i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the look out for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and i've been trying to support my country's movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david <UNK> and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships without working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny <UNK> we can't be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
<START> i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life br br what you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end br br the end is what makes this movie so good you can't expect it br br <UNK> to the producer
<START> if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street <UNK> or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat <UNK> as a juvenile <UNK> on his <UNK> farm in kentucky and you could <UNK> enjoy this movie br br this film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s <UNK> love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat <UNK> <UNK> to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen <UNK> of their love it's sort of like watching a western in which the <UNK> don't have guns br br the story is pointless even the title song is sung with <UNK> enthusiasm br br april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with <UNK> and plan 9 from outer space
<START> woody allen when at his best has one of the <UNK> <UNK> around he can make an <UNK> observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else however when he's at his worst his movies can <UNK> of <UNK> unfortunately melinda and melinda has this <UNK> from opening to closing the set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama to help settle the argument one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing one a comic playwright the other a dramatic playwright whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy the two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they <UNK> now when i first heard about this film my understanding was that they tell the exact same story the genre comedy or drama only changes by how you look at it now that would have been interesting however the stories only share one main element and a few side elements they are entirely different stories with major plot differences the drama is so <UNK> scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self parody if this was the point then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters the comedy is the story that has moments of success but they are still short and fleeting will farrell is obviously meant to be the stand in for woody but he could have played this character so much more <UNK> without adding <UNK> <UNK> and hand <UNK> woody is the best at being woody when someone else tries they're not playing a character they are <UNK> a recognizable actor this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story br br my favorite woody allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than i walked in this one made me wish i could get my money back
<START> i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5 2 br br not only does guy bring together a b list ish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination br br far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable br br this film is special get it now
<START> interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work br br when you see the film maybe you will feel as <UNK> with the ending as i did i didn't really know who to root for in the movie <UNK> <UNK> looked bored as the detective the rest of the characters seem so one dimensional and unpleasant br br if the victim alicia <UNK> <UNK> had been more of a nice girl we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the <UNK> brought to justice the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls turning from sweet girl to conniving <UNK> <UNK> i can't understand the moral message of this film and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work
<START> although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances it is certainly not when i saw the movie i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies and i was right br br stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film it has this magical <UNK> from the beginning to the very end of the movie the storyline is well written and it keeps you on the edge of your seat like every tale it has some short of morality therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every <UNK> and difficulty he encounters during his journey we also know that the true love is <UNK> and not victoria the material girl who is shallow and manipulative br br i have to give extra credits to claire danes she literally shines in this movie her eyes have this <UNK> that fit totally in her character moreover she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and <UNK> <UNK> movie br br overall the movie is fantastic the locations magical and the plot interesting i was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards i have to give at least 9 10 stars for this
<START> i bought this from blockbuster for <UNK> the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was <UNK> to sh t but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video talking of home videos since when has it been fair game to release them as films i mean to say films used to employ actors and <UNK> and <UNK> and so on not any more just gather your friends and lame o ideas together for the weekend lavish the production with an <UNK> 00 budget and get someone to fall down the stairs with a <UNK> keyboard the soundtrack then slap it on the shelves for some poor <UNK> me to take home in lonely desperation but here's the <UNK> i fast <UNK> through most of this and tossed it to one side ready for the <UNK> until the next night while watching a darren day horror <UNK> <UNK> 99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster now this film made <UNK> <UNK> look like the exorcist so i slapped grim weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards that viewers claimed were hilarious sure enough once i had got over the misery the pain and the horror of <UNK> grim weekend was utter <UNK> on <UNK> i could enjoy <UNK> and downright get down to the funny stuff and there's a lot of it check the boards then check the flick hell it might even be worth it <UNK> crap
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin <UNK> of his family's existence have been the steel mill and the union the mill which once employed 45 000 has seen its numbers <UNK> to 5 000 recently and now 1 as the plant just shut its doors leaving a single security guard at first newly unemployed <UNK> and his pals enjoy their independence hanging out around town and <UNK> at their favorite bar where they down depth charges with reckless abandon they think the mill will <UNK> after listening to their union <UNK> optimistic <UNK> but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and <UNK> off <UNK> of their homes <UNK> father a dedicated union man is sure the plant will <UNK> and recalls for his son all the short lived <UNK> during his own 35 years at the mill meanwhile some of the unemployed men take <UNK> make work jobs or hop in their <UNK> and take off in a desperate search for <UNK> br br finally the union admits its <UNK> as <UNK> explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill won't ever open again <UNK> <UNK> asks what did i do wrong as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job union church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn he hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he <UNK> his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor tossed out of his own home and <UNK> from the plant <UNK> comments that he and his men didn't work hard enough to justify their substantial <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of early in the morning they break into the mill fire up the <UNK> and work harder than they ever have in their lives producing in one shift enough high quality steel <UNK> to fill the <UNK> <UNK> from wall to wall top to bottom something the plant manager thought was impossible br br arriving at the suddenly <UNK> plant the <UNK> manager looks around him at the tremendous <UNK> that came from a single day's work realizing that production like this could make the plant <UNK> again the manager asks <UNK> can you do this every day <UNK> is forced to nod no and the manager asks then what were you trying to prove <UNK> explains that the <UNK> decades of hard work honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day we just spit in your eye <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south promising to <UNK> the family when he finds it br br this is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of american workers <UNK> by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short <UNK> of <UNK> demanding <UNK> and greedy plant owners who <UNK> every penny they could from their <UNK> but never gave back by <UNK> them peter <UNK> as <UNK> john goodman as his best friend gary cole as his college boy brother pamela reed as <UNK> sympathetic wife and john <UNK> as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture
<START> this movie is basically a documentary of the <UNK> ordered series of events that took place from april 10 2002 through april 14 2002 in the <UNK> presidential palace <UNK> <UNK> br br the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup <UNK> of president hugo chavez br br one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure hugo <UNK> persona single <UNK> brought the <UNK> people to <UNK> the 3 day old military <UNK> <UNK> and re establish the <UNK> <UNK> government of <UNK> br br it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and <UNK> the <UNK> coup <UNK> that the mainstream media aided and <UNK> george w bush is not surprising br br what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media br br it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan <UNK> of the fairness <UNK> in 1986 to turn america into blind and <UNK> state br br may hugo chavez open patriotic <UNK> eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision
<START> elizabeth <UNK> was the weakest actress of all the law and order <UNK> and her acting is even worse here her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic nor can she adequately <UNK> the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she can't remember where she left her keys br br this is an important true story so it's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress <UNK> so much from the message the rest of the cast is talented enough but they just can't overcome <UNK> tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern <UNK> whenever actual acting is required
<START> this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen i <UNK> inside throughout the whole film the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen the slow pace was set by the mode of travel a riding lawn <UNK> with a big trailer and was <UNK> by the background sights and sounds and the slow paced lives of the other characters br br the story actually happened alvin straight died in 1996 at the age of <UNK> there was no acting everything was completely real as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters sissy <UNK> gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but <UNK> ahead always wanting to do the right thing richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight a stubborn but loving elderly man who <UNK> across <UNK> to visit his estranged brother <UNK> who has had a stroke alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way br br the film <UNK> the importance of family to this man and hopefully to all of us i eagerly <UNK> seeing it again and again directed by david lynch this films proves his directorial skill farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor at <UNK> he was the oldest <UNK> ever for that award
<START> i thought it was not the best re cap episode i've every seen though my viewing partner handed me a <UNK> in anticipation of the brendan <UNK> moment sigh it was nice to see cox outside of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> state he is in these days if only for brief moments i also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair or height in case of <UNK> and the <UNK> of the earliest episodes i can also see how <UNK> might be well on the way to a very chevy chase or is that matthew perry <UNK> fall induced chemical slide already acknowledged on conan a little side note the song now stuck in my head from the janitor induced dance montage was diner by martin <UNK>
<START> this movie is all flash and no soul the actors put a lot of passion into the numbers but these numbers often didn't connect with the film and felt like stand alone music videos and no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you every single one sounds like its coming from a studio essentially sucking all the life from the songs off the stage the performances were all dull and <UNK> especially hudson who essentially plays the same angry strong she's stubborn and selfish black woman we've seen before there was absolutely no depth to her character nor any of the other female leads though i think the movie wants us to believe that <UNK> character faces <UNK> because of her weight it is really her own <UNK> to do what's best for the team that lands her in trouble making the end of the film totally meaningless <UNK> academy award is a joke there was no justification when she sang she put forth emotion though it was often misplaced but this was the writer director's fault but when she was just acting she did nothing to flesh out an already <UNK> character eddie murphy's character is the only one with an arc and he did a fine job but still not oscar worthy the only actor who really brought something to the roll was danny glover who took a small relatively <UNK> character and made something real out of it there is nothing here to sink your teeth into no drama or heart or even laughs the placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one the number when hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long <UNK> if it had been any longer it could pass for a family guy skit the movie has no idea what it's about and i felt insulted by the last few minutes it's a big boring waste of time and really is the worst film i saw in <UNK> and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with
<START> this movie was extremely depressing br br the characters were so cold the mother who is he main character is everything but <UNK> ok she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first her husband dies she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him until this part the movie is all right not excellent but it can be watched the guy is charming and who can blame her ok it's not very <UNK> to sleep with your daughter's lover but let's blame that on the shock of losing her husband br br she becomes totally obsessed with the guy i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie she's always there wanting to please him in an old fashioned way with <UNK> while he is working on her son's house i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do as if it was the only way she could get his attention the guy obviously is not very interested actually it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a <UNK> activity and instead of being insulted by that she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive i want to please you she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly br br what <UNK> me in this movie is the utter lack of self respect the mother has for herself she tells craig something like i am just a <UNK> <UNK> the first time they sleep together br br this movie is an insult to women kind if it had been me i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain
<START> i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long it brings out the child in everyone i mean who would come up with the idea of having <UNK> boys dig holes as their punishment louis <UNK> thats who although the movie was different from the book it was still very good for example <UNK> stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there weight wise and height wise but <UNK> ricky was <UNK> and <UNK> theodore was bigger also x ray rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather <UNK> and long i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion i especially like the work of the boys though like <UNK> alan who was played by jake m smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid jake m smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes so i would say if you <UNK> seen holes yet then you should <UNK> see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole <UNK> fun
<START> i happened upon this film by accident and really enjoyed timothy <UNK> character is without redeeming qualities and at one point <UNK> and star <UNK> <UNK> women as they pass by <UNK> take on the parade is different from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is terrific she looks very much like tea <UNK> but the major difference here is that <UNK> can actually act some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it's on cable
<START> after watching the rather sloppy <UNK> spy thriller <UNK> <UNK> 1969 starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior <UNK> spy thriller all i could remember was that it was produced by <UNK> de <UNK> it only took a short search on imdb to find <UNK> <UNK> once i <UNK> the title the memories came <UNK> back it is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of <UNK> and the german <UNK> of <UNK> it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks if you have an interest in war films and particularly <UNK> it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity
<START> a major <UNK> for rko radio <UNK> stars pat o'brien and randolph scott as <UNK> at a school for <UNK> pilots o'brien and scott argue over teaching methods while their students <UNK> for the affections of anne shirley <UNK> methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese but the <UNK> wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck providing a perfect target for his fellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most <UNK> of war films with moments of subtle <UNK> the death of <UNK> eddie albert <UNK> with scenes of ludicrous yellow peril melodrama the japanese literally <UNK> through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans though it can't help but seem dated today <UNK> remains an entertaining propaganda effort the film is sometimes <UNK> listed as the debut of robert ryan who'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940 br br anyone interested in <UNK> a copy of this film please contact me at <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> first off i'm not some justin timberlake <UNK> obsessed with making him look good in fact i'm not even a huge justin fan but i did like this movie br br i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about i didn't find <UNK> acting that bad it was clearly the worst out of the group but it's a pretty impressive group with cary <UNK> and dylan mcdermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list the story is basic a journalist <UNK> corrupt cops but i found it well done l l cool <UNK> character was clearly conflicted but i honestly didn't know what he would do in the end morgan freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well and as much as i love kevin spacey he was kind of just there his character didn't have a whole lot of substance but it's kevin spacey he can do no wrong br br surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop truly believable and really in character he freaked me out a couple of times br br i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest horrible <UNK> <UNK> action sequences stuff like that but it was surprisingly well done and i didn't find any of that every shooting had a point it wasn't clichéd pretty solid really br br overall amazing cast decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump i don't know why it didn't appear in theatres it was better than some garbage i've seen on the big screen i would say it's worth seeing
<START> the memory of the the last hunt has stuck with me since i saw it in 1956 when i was 13 it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives the environment and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed it is as relevant today as in 1956 a <UNK> discussion of <UNK> depth and relevance to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days
<START> this movie came to me highly recommended by matt <UNK> well actually i watched both the simpsons and <UNK> and it gets a mention in both so i figured what the heck the film brings home a few what <UNK> that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted interesting though that in the year <UNK> men are still <UNK> with a single blade safety razor nice that those responsible didn't over load the film with unnecessary special effects ray guns etc some nice looking <UNK> once you figure out what that means remember <UNK> is soylent green day
<START> it is incredible yes someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film it is don't do so i'm totally <UNK> i liked wesley snipes and i <UNK> funny that he played his <UNK> meaning in a movie anyway i wanted to see this film at home only of course but now just after i am absolutely disappointed it was his worst movie ever <UNK> bad actor play bad cameraman bad scenario only one good think that wonderful girl must be a <UNK> surely <UNK> <UNK> 10 lines minimum i don't want to waste you're time anymore to read my opinion i hope i was clear and under stable because english is not my native method of speaking so have <UNK> time and see good films like i try too peace
<START> as there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom it was a waste of <UNK> minutes to see the martian man hunter you have to know that in the middle of the <UNK> series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of <UNK> i really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the <UNK> needs to be <UNK> this was by far one of the worst with in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on <UNK> <UNK> obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week may as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell clark he forgot his <UNK> to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day
