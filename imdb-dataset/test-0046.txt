<START> make no mistake about high school is a bad movie br br high school is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl however he goes about it all wrong and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people thankfully including the girl br br the moral of the story is all women care about is wealth also for us men i guess we're just supposed to accept we either have it or we don't have it br br i could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1 however it is above that of the very worst of movies the <UNK> not totally horrible and production values aren't ultra terrible over all it's a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons if you insist of course at torturing yourself watch the <UNK> version br br 2 10 maybe a 1 5 10
<START> the other reviewers are way <UNK> off as to why the <UNK> show has been <UNK> put to rest it has nothing to do with the quality of the shows in fact the exact opposite is true they kept getting better and better i have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much <UNK> it gets as they move on and on and the <UNK> subplots are really very interesting and gave it more vibe not less before it was sort of chaotic slow and rather <UNK> they spent like the first two seasons running from this <UNK> type but in the second two they were actually trying to do something also i have never seen such a great fun blend of sexy <UNK> and attitudes in sci fi the blue girl was cool but not they literally got to the point where the <UNK> were running around in leather <UNK> and high heels <UNK> aliens now tell me what could be <UNK> than that br br the real reason <UNK> went off for a bit is because it was <UNK> too much and that is a good thing for the fans because the show watched end to end is really like a 60 hour long epic movie with all the <UNK> of the blockbuster stuff ok ok they do use similar sets a lot but the cg is great and the <UNK> are br br blah blah the real reason is because tv shows are about profit it is a business and the sci fi channel or whoever was not getting as big a return on this expensive <UNK> show as they could with junk shows like <UNK> was actually cool until they got rid of the hot german girl and replaced her with this bizarre fat <UNK> <UNK> br br anyway yes remember this <UNK> kept getting better and better until it was really like a little real movie each week then the networks decided <UNK> people will watch any old piece of <UNK> we <UNK> on the air as long as it is the only sci fi thing on at that hour so why are we spending all this money on <UNK> let's <UNK> cheesy low budget <UNK> down people's throats and call it a <UNK> <UNK> because it's like all we play every darn night lol br br that's the way it goes also i gotta tell ya that <UNK> black is a really cool actress after she got her <UNK> got the <UNK> eyes <UNK> she was looking really cool one of those dynamic types like judy davis and sometimes hot looking sometimes ugly like a roller coaster ride i'd par <UNK> black with lucy <UNK> in style and substance both very fun to watch not just and yeah you may say the <UNK> thing was cheesy but how many sci fi shows have a believable and deep romantic subplot that actually goes somewhere and progresses it was <UNK> cool as a romance story the actors on the show are great it really is a shame the show is in <UNK> for now but i hope it comes back in more episodes soon and movies as well because i will <UNK> buy them d
<START> i managed to obtain an original bbc broadcast of this film on video and loved it so much i had to try and locate the original video in its original box thanks go to ebay br br deleted on any format since 1990 this exceptional <UNK> film is finely constructed and well acted directed by stewart mac me the scenes of <UNK> <UNK> running through the <UNK> wilderness is nothing short of stunning and its timeless tale of a <UNK> trying to survive on his own in the frozen wastes with two young tiger <UNK> is moving on each viewing br br why no major company has picked up this movie to <UNK> on dvd is a big wonder but makes it that extra special to know its also hard to locate br br if you find this film by chance or eventually track it down to add to your collection make sure never to let it <UNK> out of your grasp films of this <UNK> as shown don't come often br br a true masterpiece in every sense of the word and highly worthy of its praised comments when the north wind blows will sink deep into your heart as soon as you see it
<START> if i ever write movies or make them i would want one of them to be like this one i enjoy the goof ball sense of humor and jokes contained within this movie does stupid things without looking like it the names of the places and characters are priceless generic new york high school <UNK> <UNK> sister etc genius i've seen this movie so many times because it was a cable tv <UNK> while i was growing up of course i didn't get all of the jokes back than but it was still funny this movie is a time less classic
<START> how many of us have read a book or seen a play and then when the movie version came out we were terribly disappointed well maybe this would be one of those movies for those who saw the play too but as someone who never had the opportunity to see it on stage i was extremely entertained by this movie the characters were funny the music was great and the story was interesting and made you feel genuine empathy for the characters flaws and all jonathan silverman has such good comedic timing and his lines especially are hilarious i'm not going to give any spoilers it's just a nicely done funny movie showing the inner <UNK> of a middle class family during wwii so if you never saw the play and if you have enjoyed other neil simon movies don't be held back by the couple of negative reviews seen here on its own <UNK> beach <UNK> is a great movie i guarantee it no money back though
<START> this is a truly heartwarming film not just about love but about learning about yourself and your values in life though the story is a novel starting point for a film it is easily recognized by most people it combines a wicked sense of humor with a subtle assault on <UNK> not to be missed
<START> i saw this movie in the early 70's when i was about 10 <UNK> old on tv it was on after school and as i watched i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two <UNK> going on a mission to another <UNK> planet that i asked my mom if i could get the <UNK> <UNK> out she let me so i wrapped the <UNK> of the <UNK> around the channel <UNK> so the <UNK> was hanging in front of the <UNK> this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to and cared enough about to record just the audio there were no <UNK> at the time the plot will have you hanging onto every word every minute of this film the ending will blow your mind after watching the journey to the far side of the sun you will have flash backs in your mind about it for a long time i did replay the audio recording for many years and saw it over and over in my mind then maybe 15 years later when <UNK> were common and they sold tapes in stores i always looked for it but never found it but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second so after about 30 years after seeing it for the first time i got to see it again wow it was spectacular just for reference i must have watched it 50 times since
<START> some major spoilers you've been warned br br i saw this movie yesterday at film festival and i must admit that being a fan it was really impressive excellent graphic excellent music excellent dubbing excellent action sequences and so on but there's a but all the film was thought exclusively for the <UNK> that have loved it and that can therefore enjoy every single reference character inside joke you should see a joke with winning music that's particularly comic etc a poor man not inside the world of <UNK> will obviously see the <UNK> of technical part but cannot grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing e g <UNK> appearing and shooting totally out of nowhere he'll ask himself who's this guy and i cannot blame him he cannot even understand what a <UNK> feels when in the opening sequence there's <UNK> opening music running in the canyon with his two <UNK> howling at ruins and then <UNK> years ago almost all characters have made an appearance or quote including reeve and <UNK> and reno rude were really goofy and comic to see but the final impression the movie left to me was hardcore final dream but far less for a movie fan
<START> all dogs go to heaven was a quirky funny movie with good name talent who's voices an adult <UNK> to a cartoon <UNK> for kids it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watch br br unfortunately is a <UNK> sequel trying to make a bit of cash on the <UNK> of the first charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and <UNK> voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a co star for this add dom <UNK> from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one br br unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as <UNK> in the horrible role of this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills or lack thereof present all over this movie horrible editing of the voices and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to <UNK> but are not combine to make this movie look like a college <UNK> animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been br br all in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large pass
<START> despite strong performances by <UNK> driver and tom <UNK> this film fails to <UNK> the imagination of the viewer br br by the way what has become of ms driver she had such a potential in the film industry br br this to me was almost like an <UNK> version of <UNK> without the musical <UNK> with the death of her father driver takes a position as a <UNK> to a christian family hiding her jewish identity br br while i realize that this is a period peace it was awfully dull even for <UNK> england and scotland br br the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing song voice of hers i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment what kind of name is mary i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian but does this name <UNK> all the way br br in the <UNK> mary finds love with the young father <UNK> and his emotionally <UNK> son br br in the end the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film br br the early scenes of <UNK> <UNK> in 19th century england and the <UNK> <UNK> at the end could have been played up more there is a definite underlying feeling of anti <UNK> by the <UNK> family but that's never allowed to come out
<START> i own this movie i've seen it over 20 times and every time i still get <UNK> its a great love story surprises and you can <UNK> feel chemistry between <UNK> and i <UNK> give this movie a perfect 10 i recommend this to anyone
<START> i first saw this film in the mid 60's when i was a teenager and it moved me so much in fact the end scene where han hears of <UNK> death and then rushes to the hill in disbelief where you then hear <UNK> voice saying give me your hand and then the image of him disappears the <UNK> with it's <UNK> meaning the music the <UNK> emotions of love of han just left me <UNK> my heart out i was <UNK> crying <UNK> my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction i just left the room to be on my own fortunately i do not react like that any more but i always cry at the end i love everything about the film the music mostly the costumes of han and location the beauty of jennifer jones and the handsome william <UNK> they were both at their best i have the vhs and dvd of this wonderful movie i also have two versions of the music lyrics by arthur newman and sammy i also have the book a many thing by han i recommend this film 100
<START> my take even splendid underwater photography can salvage a familiar script and paper thin characters br br for those who haven't already got enough of the free willy pictures <UNK> might serve up a decent rental others are heavily suggested to stay away although <UNK> is harmless affair it hardly showcases anything for the adult audience unless it's your first time to see a <UNK> br br a remake of a 1960's tv show and film <UNK> may have sound like a good idea back then a <UNK> charms the life of boy and a girl they help <UNK> the environment by first getting rid of toxic wastes thrown in on the <UNK> waters of the florida keys and at the same time battle a shark and a <UNK> sea baddie who happens to be the one responsible for the toxic <UNK> and also happens to hate <UNK> but even for the 90's especially if an <UNK> similar film like free willy was a recent hit <UNK> is just another harmless yet occasionally empty summer <UNK> movie for the kids although the animals this in case is the main <UNK> a clumsy <UNK> and a realistic looking hammerhead shark <UNK> as the villain and the <UNK> underwater cinematography steal the show there's nothing much in <UNK> to steal from anyway br br the story is completely predictable something than nowadays even a 6 year old may find evident the human cast led by a pre lord of the rings <UNK> wood and an out of work paul hogan have rarely anything to do but stand around and look pretty their acting skills whatever they may be to this movie is rarely revealed on screen unless you consider the acting talents of cheerful <UNK> i guess not trying to recommend <UNK> as mindless family entertainment won't be fair but anyone over the age of 10 no make that 8 are better off renting or buying something else besides the film is about 95 minutes tops that might just give you enough time to something elsewhere without worrying about your kids that alone might be worth the rental br br rating out of 5
<START> the <UNK> is one of the worst films i ever saw the story really seems original but it was badly <UNK> on screen lance <UNK> a good actor ended up in this crap but hey he made a lot of low budget films you need to pay the bills you know kidding lance is a great actor but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors seriously <UNK> roth was there just to have a nudity scene and other actors well they were just there there was constantly a fade out fade in editing and that makes me sick that was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry it was also very predictable boring and slow it has a bizarre <UNK> that goes just wrong br br can't say more don't rent it or buy it you can watch it if on tv
<START> this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever i have heard the <UNK> cast album the angela lansbury album i have seen <UNK> <UNK> live and i've seen the <UNK> russell movie countless times i think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the <UNK> but also the pathos of mama rose i was never a natalie wood fan so i really enjoyed <UNK> in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three <UNK> led by the always <UNK> christine <UNK> are hard to top there was supposed to be a tv production of <UNK> a few years back with cher but i think bette would be the best bet pun intended for <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first of all this is an art film and a good one at that i loved the presentation and way it was shot very cool certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences i've ever seen this film did scare me not because of suspense or shock but because i was <UNK> afraid that i'd soon see something really appalling that did happen in a few places but mostly at the beginning this film also dragged and the <UNK> minutes seemed long however if you're into film you have to see this to date i've seen nothing like it 8 10
<START> this movie is a fascinating example of luis <UNK> storytelling abilities this is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama even though i don't think it was particularly funny it made me laugh also despite the fact that you can never take <UNK> too seriously the movie made think about religion and its importance in some people's lives <UNK> tells the story of a catholic priest devoted to his faith like no one else and the viewer witness what happens when the <UNK> <UNK> commitment to serve others is put to test as usual <UNK> target is <UNK> but i don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does at least i didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution i think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a <UNK> in today's modern society not because faith in itself is bad but because people always <UNK> to the concept message aside i think this is one of <UNK> most clever works francisco is superb as the priest definitely one of the <UNK> best movies
<START> when a group of escaped <UNK> manage to flee to a remote island they soon find that their new home is inhabited by a strangely menacing doctor richard johnson of zombi 2 fame a mad scientist joseph <UNK> his beautiful daughter barbara bach and a <UNK> of <UNK> natives the <UNK> say that the doctor has created grotesque half human half fish creatures for evil <UNK> purposes and though at first the prisoners do not believe this as they disappear one by one they begin to change their minds is a very entertaining mix of mysterious island and <UNK> from the deep there is plenty of gore with really cool <UNK> scene and throat <UNK> to boost the acting is so so but the film is fast paced and entertaining give it a look 8 out of 10
<START> i love this show it's clever and very well acted david morse and andre <UNK> have great chemistry the writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief after every new episode i'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is my only complaint would be donna murphy's absence at this point in the second season as david morse ex wife heather she added such character to the show br br i think this show is a credit to the crime drama genre with that said i can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique
<START> this movie is a real shame not just for the plot the empty performance of the characters it is for the lack of creativity from the director and all the crew this is maybe one of the worst movies of all times and it is hard to believe that is the sequel of one of the most famous movies of the 90's br br i am a great fan of the mask when i went to see this movie i was expecting to a movie with a good sense of humor a movie with a acceptable plot instead i saw a really bad copy of chuck jones and <UNK> <UNK> cartoons the movie was not funny even for my 7 years old sister so i wonder what was wrong new line cinema was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie or was it trying to create another masterpiece like the lord of the rings because if they did they were completely out of their minds
<START> i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film it really is quite funny there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other some of the situations might be unsettling <UNK> drugs a particularly strange child's view of sexuality but believable at the same time it's about communication and <UNK> between men and women
<START> amazing one of my favorite movies way down at the bottom guess i can take some pride in not liking what the general <UNK> tends to go for jackie mason is hilarious in this movie and <UNK> randy quaid i can never get enough of his strong arm tactics just like in moving he was also notable in national <UNK> christmas vacation love that guy
<START> death bed the bed that eats is a <UNK> bizarre horror film that truly has to be seen to be believed there is an ancient four poster bed that just loves to eat humans and it does so anytime it can lure anyone to lie upon it there is also a long dead artist imprisoned behind one of his paintings who provides a voice over narration george <UNK> the first and only one film offers some truly surreal moments such as the bed absorbing its victims in a mysterious sea of yellow <UNK> and <UNK> the atmosphere is dreamy and there is only a little bit of gore unfortunately the premise is rather silly and the acting is amateurish still as fan of unusual cinema i enjoyed this low budget <UNK> give it a chance 8 out of 10
<START> quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years not only does it suffer from a painfully and enormously predictable disjointed script but it's clearly a <UNK> copy of alien ii within five minutes i had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldn't and in which order the special effects are laughable there is a scene where one crew member is <UNK> <UNK> by two that look like a pair of teddy bears and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire there are better things to do with a vcr remote than use it to watch this movie
<START> i couldn't even sit through the whole thing this movie was a piece of crap i had more fun watching tell mom the dead it was just too painful to watch say besides austin powers has tom arnold ever been in a hit movie
<START> this movie definitely shows something and <UNK> light on what happens in most <UNK> today and shows how one <UNK> just with the help of her newspaper manages to get things done her editor has complete faith in her and doesn't <UNK> something important because it would harm her friend and when it was the right time she took the necessary action br br the movie overall got a rating of 9 from me because its got everything i mean it keeps you entertained and moreover they have acted really well for a tv movie its really high quality acting that deserves alot of credit
<START> this film would like to be the kind of shocking cerebral and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been but it's not it is at best confusing and absurd when the twists and turns finally revealed themselves rather than saying <UNK> i get it i <UNK> something along the lines of okay whatever in my opinion when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would <UNK> the viewer to <UNK> the truth himself but this movie does have a flashback and here's the <UNK> it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie br br the characters were stereotypical unsympathetic and wholly ridiculous i feel that the steamy love scenes between the romantic leads were the most and <UNK> that i've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn it seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes but they were really just plain silly br br and don't even get me started on the crappy accents and second rate sets i guess the movie was set in new orleans but aside from the <UNK> mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in usa br br my recommendation don't bother
<START> the inherent problem with any staging of 'the <UNK> of has never been the pseudo controversial anti <UNK> but the fact that there are two story lines wildly different in both tone and content a <UNK> romantic comedy and a <UNK> tragedy while mixing genres was all the rage in the <UNK> century and <UNK> by shakespeare in hamlet it rarely fails to <UNK> with modern audiences as a result most directors are forced to place an emphasis on one storyline at the expense of the other and it is no surprise that the decision falls in the favour of <UNK> br br like so many of shakespeare's great tragic heroes <UNK> continues to <UNK> after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character pitiful proud angry vengeful weak arrogant his behaviour defies simply analysis and continues to be <UNK> over he is flawed not because he is a jew but because he is human rarely do modern screenwriters <UNK> their creations with such richly <UNK> <UNK> and it is to everyone's benefit that we have shakespeare to draw on for inspiration br br shakespearean language is wild and rambling <UNK> in multiple meanings word play and metaphor to be understood it must be <UNK> and <UNK> by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so when an actor fails the words pour forth in a <UNK> of incomprehensible words but when he succeeds the english language springs to life with an <UNK> and <UNK> that takes your breath away al pacino is one such actor and here displays an incredible level of clarity and control that were there any justice would <UNK> every award in the offering he meets the challenge of presenting <UNK> head on and delivers an extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance it would be a crime if we never got the opportunity to see what he does with king <UNK> br br the supporting cast is noteworthy jeremy <UNK> gives an original take on the familiar antonio presenting an older <UNK> figure that displays the <UNK> <UNK> between medieval <UNK> and ugly prejudice of the time joseph <UNK> is a revelation as he <UNK> beyond superficial eye candy to actually inhabit a character for once <UNK> collins is the only disappointment many of shakespeare's women are <UNK> and require an actor to really work hard to bring them to life and <UNK> gwyneth paltrow <UNK> seems a little flat and <UNK> to the darker tone that <UNK> is aiming for br br the design team must be acknowledged for creating a unique and thoroughly believable vision of late renaissance <UNK> the city has not looked this ominous since <UNK> look <UNK> taking full advantage of <UNK> locations and natural light the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and <UNK> costume design all again are worthy of award recognition br br the financial <UNK> of films such as this must be <UNK> with a budget of 30 million they must go into such a venture in the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit and yet they <UNK> nonetheless we can all be grateful for it as the result is a remarkable adaptation that is sure to be a <UNK> for many years to come
<START> i thought i was going to watch another friday the 13th or a halloween rip off but i was surprised it's about 3 psycho kids who kill there's not too many movies like that i can think of <UNK> children of the corn and a few others it's not the greatest horror movie but it's a least worth a rent
<START> the plane is a <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is located on the upper deck on a <UNK> in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the <UNK> they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the <UNK> what a <UNK> the front of the first class cabin has a for <UNK> and a tv screen beyond that is the radar <UNK> before <UNK> a <UNK> is shown to <UNK> the taxi to the <UNK> on take off the plane is shown to have only two <UNK> <UNK> has four <UNK> who was in charge of continuity on this movie during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes <UNK> another <UNK> <UNK> after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice versa at this point i stopped watching absolute rubbish
<START> this film is a refreshing change of pace from the mindless hong kong <UNK> movies i have grown so tired of there are no spectacular gun fights no car chases and practically minimal action to speak of the audience is kept in suspense for the most part though certain aspects of the so called <UNK> by andy <UNK> are quite obvious br br the film has been <UNK> as a departure from the genre of violent <UNK> films and as an intelligent crime film to an extent it is but to some extent it still fails the believability test one can hardly picture any <UNK> member to be dumb enough to not see through the female disguise of andy <UNK> in a second it also seemed to have fallen for the if someone was seriously ill the said someone will be <UNK> up <UNK> amounts of blood regularly thing chinese films seem to go for all the time br br the subtle relationship between the two lead characters is a refreshing change br br all in all an enjoyable film even though the concept is not new and there are few surprises
<START> <UNK> sophisticated <UNK> <UNK> powerful i could think of a hundred <UNK> to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence and still i would feel they were <UNK> all i can really say is that i am <UNK> with this film applause to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jean louis <UNK> may <UNK> live forever
<START> independent film that would make hollywood proud the movie <UNK> good looks for good acting a <UNK> plot for a good story line and self <UNK> for character development may be i missed something go see it for yourself
<START> i made the mistake of buying this since i collect comic book inspired movies even at 6 it was too expensive i thought there might be some campy fun in it a so bad it becomes good vibe perhaps i was wrong i had watched it once long ago and didn't remember any of it now i know why i was bored out of my mind and was looking for <UNK> to do something else i'm all for power punk attitude and absurd humor but tank girl does not work on any front the script is bad you don't care about the characters and the humor is mostly lame except for a few amusing one liners the special effects or locations are poor or often replaced by comic <UNK> or animations that are just too jarring compared to the live action it's like they didn't have the money to shoot the cool stuff and so <UNK> to drawings however cool they might be an <UNK> animated feature would be way better for tank girl now that i think about it the action scenes were cheesy but not in a fun b movie way the tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic although it was interestingly <UNK> as a matter of fact the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation br br it does have some interesting songs by known artists such as <UNK> hole and but instead of <UNK> the atmosphere they just don't fit most of the time once they even break into a ludicrous song and dance number that was just senseless and horrible i think that's when i totally tuned out i suppose tank girl played by <UNK> petty looks the trashy <UNK> part but beyond her attitude and sometimes barely amusing <UNK> is more two dimensional and superficial than the worst comic book characters jet played by <UNK> <UNK> is probably the only saving grace of the film and it's amazing how such a good actress was involved in this mess malcolm mcdowell wasn't too bad playing his usual villain role it might be a cult movie for some but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie themselves check out the entry for tank girl on <UNK> br br rating 3 out of 10
<START> warning contains spoilers br br written by husband and wife <UNK> who also directed and <UNK> forbes this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory br br jay <UNK> takes a break from playing smarmy <UNK> to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancée wants to bed other people and he's allowed to do so too <UNK> nicholson who was so good in <UNK> plays <UNK> and vulnerable with great gusto too bad she doesn't get the recognition she deserves br br good supporting performances help immensely too lauren graham who made last year's bad santa memorable plays the jaded cynical sister to perfection bryan <UNK> the dad on tv's malcolm in the middle gets a few funny raunchy moments and andy <UNK> plays a <UNK> guy who falls for a single mother helen slater in a credible albeit familiar role as a <UNK> woman br br what surprised me most about seeing other people was how funny it is there are some genuine laughs here <UNK> first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines and there's a <UNK> a <UNK> that <UNK> one of the most truthful reactions from a man as the male fantasy gets <UNK> br br the film's premise isn't unusual but i liked that it was alice nicholson who thought of it much to the <UNK> of ed <UNK> given the genre you know that no matter how good her intentions are <UNK> plan is doomed we see how the couple works through this strange situation initially alice and ed are turned on by the idea but then the human element sets it br br i appreciated forbes and not turning this into a cheap sex romp yes there's sex and nudity but there also are real emotions at work here the other people alice and ed <UNK> don't want to be the objects of casual sex they have feelings too in one case too many feelings br br granted some scenes run one joke too many the <UNK> slater subplot isn't necessary and alice does something truly <UNK> but that's forgivable because <UNK> and nicholson generate such tremendous <UNK> and honesty check out the scenes where ed through <UNK> underwear <UNK> or his reaction to her <UNK> about ending the experiment that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game we root for this couple to succeed br br unfortunately this film got little if any publicity and a limited release hollywood studios whose romantic comedies often <UNK> on the unfunny turgid and <UNK> would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film
<START> this is the best show ever no matter what you say i have been watching this show since cycle 1 this show is never boring its wonderful how you see peoples dream come true of being a model <UNK> is trying her best to help young women not be ashamed of their bodies and make them believe that they are beautiful in their own way and that you don't have to feel beautiful by being <UNK> and just as <UNK> says on the <UNK> show so what if your <UNK> so what if you have a big round <UNK> so what if you have a big nose so what if your not as beautiful as the people in magazines you are beautiful to her so what
<START> i have to confess that i know some of those involved i was in the <UNK> to the planet evil however this was more than 10 years ago and i had since lost contact with them i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from it's director mark this <UNK> me to order a copy of the film on dvd br br now to the film the level of acting writing directing and <UNK> is up there with some of the best around ok it's not star wars but i've seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passed br br mild spoilers br br the planet draws on several sci fi classics star wars alien pitch black forbidden planet and predator a handful of the <UNK> crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible <UNK> the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive br br the planet is a brilliant piece of sci fi film making that certainly hides it's limited budget well done to mark mike and all those involved i look forward to your next work
<START> i didn't like this movie to me it didn't make much sense it was hard to figure out what was really happening i also didn't think it was scary i did however think it was silly even absurd but not in a good way <UNK> mitchell is the main character in the movie which <UNK> out in 2003 she was also <UNK> in <UNK> silent hill which i hated it too i found confusing and pointless <UNK> isn't as bad but i think it is certainly below average there is just nothing special about it the script is just too muddled and there are things in the movie which don't need to be there in my opinion i think <UNK> mitchell is probably a good actress if she has more to work with my vote for <UNK> is 4 10
<START> i loved the original p h and was somewhat satisfied with ii and <UNK> to <UNK> iii then i saw part iv oh boy as a <UNK> i did my best to give part 4 as much credit as i could but it's pretty bad the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing the <UNK> and mccoy storyline is <UNK> stupid and cliché how did the producers get away with using that tired family <UNK> storyline wow unbelievable the acting besides is below average the plot and script are mind numbing the actual editing and cinematography are average as is the directing i mean the movie isn't a total loss as always i really enjoy watching <UNK> i love seeing <UNK> the witch and like watching ghost in action but all three characters had way too much screen time i thought <UNK> and <UNK> would wind up going out to a <UNK> club for an evening bite to eat and drinks the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin the bottom line is is that i wanted all the characters in this <UNK> fest of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the picture where does sci fi get these so called film production professionals from anyway i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk i'm sure there was a limited budget and everything but come on see it if your a fan of the other three but just once and then go back and stick to the original two shame on you sci fi

<START> one can only sit in utter <UNK> at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the <UNK> people have <UNK> upon it the biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make up his mind as to whether it's black comedy farce or a combination of both it <UNK> all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom what a shame to see the talented <UNK> comic talents <UNK> and the ever annoying jane <UNK> is so over the top she's more <UNK> than usual br br perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the quirky french nature of the film therefore it's labeled smart or genius it's neither instead it's bad tripe that leaves a rather <UNK> after taste <UNK> <UNK> should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no <UNK> of comedy
<START> the <UNK> is one of my favorite clint eastwood films and a departure from his typical early roles directed by don <UNK> with whom eastwood <UNK> on several films it was made a year before eastwood's directorial debut with play misty for me an alternate title considered for the film was <UNK> <UNK> down at the old plantation which thankfully was not used otherwise i am sure raunchy jokes about the fact that it takes place at a girls' school would be difficult to avoid i first saw this movie in one of my college film classes in the mid 1970's and was immediately taken with it i only had an old <UNK> vhs tape of it until i recently purchased the widescreen dvd which also includes the hilarious awful trailer that makes the film come across as a <UNK> place soap opera and conveys none of the creepiness of the film br br interesting notes eastwood and <UNK> had to battle with universal pictures to keep the original ending and they won out and the film was billed as a standard eastwood western which it certainly is not it is a gothic tale of deception and horror set in the time of the civil war with an underlying tone of <UNK> and sexual tension running throughout br br i'm not putting any spoilers in this review and if you want to see the film as it should be seen then be careful of looking it up on the internet as spoiler reviews of it do abound br br clint eastwood portrays john a union soldier who is shot on <UNK> ground and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girls' school she <UNK> him and takes him back to the school but instead of <UNK> the local <UNK> of his presence so that he will be taken to prison the <UNK> miss martha <UNK> page her assistant <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> their black servant <UNK> mae <UNK> and the mostly teenage girls take him in <UNK> him and fall under his spell the film sets its tone of creepiness and gothic horror right from the titles as it shows real <UNK> shots from the war while eastwood's voice is heard quietly singing a <UNK> song of the time br br the opening scene of his encounter with the little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character and the tone of the entire movie to say any more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene to say much more about the film itself might ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it if you are into creepy gothic tales find it and rent it eastwood is excellent in the film and it is interesting to see him in an early role or any role where he portrays a character that is for the most part very unsympathetic br br <UNK> page had a <UNK> role in the film as the <UNK> and i cannot imagine another actress of the time being as good in the role a long shot could have been <UNK> laurie but i don't think laurie could have <UNK> the role in the same manner as <UNK> page br br elizabeth <UNK> whose wonderful performance in the film a <UNK> of blue as a blind girl who falls in love with sidney character is another high point in her short career is at her prime here delicate and masterful at the same time unfortunately her <UNK> on film was also a part of her real life she committed suicide at age 45 br br i end this review with this observation one manipulative lying <UNK> man is no match for a of <UNK> and <UNK> southern <UNK>
<START> stanley kubrick a director who i hold in the highest of for his masterpieces clockwork orange 2001 the killing the shining dr <UNK> etc took the film out of <UNK> leaving it to be found by only the hardcore fans and <UNK> after seeing the film for myself i could see why at the age of 24 kubrick had already <UNK> his craft of still photography for look magazine and had done a few short documentaries like many first time filmmakers that came in the decades after him his ambition for fear and desire was in short to just go and make a film cheaply more than likely to see if he could do it on that level he was successful however the film itself definitely is not br br i can't really say that the film is a failure because there was something i did like about it throughout even as the film's story went on the <UNK> and the actors whom kubrick didn't have any idea how to direct not being a man of the theater his knack for producing and capturing some great images gets its <UNK> in this film at times there are some shots of close ups and quick shots in suspense action scenes that are eye catching unfortunately this is all the good i can really say of the film although there are a couple of <UNK> actors in the film frank who also appeared in killer's kiss and paul <UNK> a director in his own right the performances overall are dull and very routine br br in fact that is the film's main demise for me whenever i watch any kubrick film even his early film <UNK> killer's kiss and the killing i can tell who made it as his style by then became distinct which would continue as he evolved as an artist it wasn't <UNK> like i might have <UNK> which is usually the case with first time directors like scorsese and spielberg but watching this film not only did it feel like it wasn't kubrick it felt like a lot of the time i was watching some b or even c grade movie by a director that time forgot not quite <UNK> <UNK> bad but close the music is as standard as can be the fades are pedestrian and the plot seems to not really hold that much attention br br in short as others have said and which i can agree this is a <UNK> pad of a future ground <UNK> who shows some shots and a few edits that grab some attention the best scene overall being when the soldiers take the dumb girl hostage but not enough to really recommend except to those like myself who end up seeing everything by kubrick or perhaps have to see every ultra low budget war film ever made if only out of curiosity
<START> a great combination <UNK> humor world and characters limited presence of christian <UNK> br br the original comics was great one of the better of an overall great series and <UNK> <UNK> one of the funniest member of the famous french group les was able to film <UNK> and <UNK> the great work done by and by cleverly <UNK> the story giving to his best role at last a little bit far from his usual part gathering a bunch of great actors gerard is wonderful as often <UNK> himself is a great <UNK> br br in addition while being <UNK> to keep on with christian <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> cleverly tuned down his role in the movie to give <UNK> to and which is always a good idea br br great environment great scenario great director great actors great humor beautiful <UNK> this movie would have deserved a 10 if <UNK> hadn't been involved
<START> not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like <UNK> does i know youngsters and 30 40 years old fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this t v miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t v character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the <UNK> <UNK> a run for his money in the stakes <UNK> theory time travel in true form magnificent it <UNK> cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from br br with such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where <UNK> really comes into it's own element it succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept <UNK> them over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as <UNK> are <UNK> and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep <UNK> in after that to see if <UNK> would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed <UNK> insomnia <UNK> was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights br br do yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i mean br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i just have watched icon on dvd and despite being a great book the movie is a weak from it those responsible for the writing should be <UNK> to <UNK> why they <UNK> the great story with all kind of c film which are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond me br br yet the filmmakers and cast do there best to make something out of it but at the end the film was not satisfying at all br br can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done i'm sure that the crowds will <UNK> for such a masterpiece novel turned into a book not into a cheap c movie
<START> i liked this movie way too much my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael <UNK> of <UNK> is just a low rent jack nicholson i guess mike was busy that year with <UNK> 2 the sadly <UNK> 2 would have been a much better career move it is certainly the best of the <UNK> series and in many ways reminiscent of that great big screen classic masters of the universe not only does it star the <UNK> mark singer it also features an amazing supporting cast specifically the second girl from <UNK> uncle phil from fresh prince of and evil chick from superman 2 it <UNK> my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical <UNK> <UNK> forever roll
<START> the relationship between the main characters i thought was very realistic how the two end up involved is believable it doesn't have that whole oh yeah right that most hollywood movies have not too mention how they captured the sexy beautiful and painful side of <UNK> i am a <UNK> student and i love that they showed how hard it is on the body hands and yeah those fabric burns are brutal definitely a must see for the relationship as well as the art that is made in the movie i loved it i'm happy with the way the movie ended but i definitely wanted to see more be sure to stay <UNK> through the credits for a special treat <UNK> great scene
<START> carlos is perhaps not the most original comic but the first series was amusing his <UNK> comments and observations were fresh i missed a couple of seasons but after all of the <UNK> of stealing material i caught a couple of episodes of the mind of <UNK> at the end of july <UNK> a bit of a change i see carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations in one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as chris rock and dave i think not perhaps comedy central will give him one more season but episodes i saw sounded tired and <UNK> with more words <UNK> out than the carlos go back to stand up for a couple of years get some fresh material and try again
<START> i'm egyptian i have a green card i have been living in the us since 1991 i have a very common <UNK> name i'm married non american but non egyptian non arab wife i have children who are born in the us i have a <UNK> in cell <UNK> from the us and i travel for <UNK> i make 6 figure <UNK> and i own a home in the washington <UNK> area i pay my <UNK> and outside 1 or 2 parking tickets i have no <UNK> on my record since i came to this country in 1991 i look more egyptian than the character but my spoken english is as good as his br br a couple of months ago i was returning from a <UNK> company business in spain through <UNK> germany to washington <UNK> home i was picked up in <UNK> airport by a german officer as soon as i got off the <UNK> plane he was waiting for me he was about to start <UNK> me until i simply told him i have no business in germany i'm just passing through he had let me go with the <UNK> disappointment that was nothing compared to what happened at washington airport which was not nearly as bad as what happened to in the movie the customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip he then wrote a letter c on my <UNK> <UNK> form and let me go after i picked up my checked bag i was stopped at the last exit point some <UNK> security crap i sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different <UNK> i was not told the reason for my i was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone i was <UNK> at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see i asked if i can call my wife to tell her that i'm going to be late but was told no when i tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello an officer <UNK> the phone out of hand and threatened me to it when i asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting they said three hours is nothing we will make contact after 5 hours when i asked to use the bathroom an officer accompanied me there it toilet was funny i guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat finally they called my name and gave me my <UNK> green card and said you can go i asked what the problem was they said nothing i know it was only 3 hours but i was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids br br as for the movie it was very well made unlike most movies that involve <UNK> and use non arab actors who just speak <UNK> this movie the <UNK> was 100 correct i assume the country is <UNK> north africa
<START> everything about choose connor was top <UNK> especially the script and the very <UNK> work done by the 21 year old director writer producer luke a talented young man from whom to expect great things all the acting was credible the dialogue smart the theme important loved it br br saw it at the 2007 <UNK> film festival where it was screened twice and went over tremendously with the audiences it's more than just a coming of age movie this kid learns a hard heartbreaking lesson about trust politics and the system how things really work to suit the personal <UNK> of those in powerful positions br br i would recommend this movie to anyone with a working brain
<START> this was an absolute disgrace the worst <UNK> i have ever seen german <UNK> with a <UNK> english accent they didn't even attempt to be german how were we supposed to take them seriously garbage garbage garbage leave the german acting to the likes of ralph <UNK> liam neeson in future
<START> the cover case and the premise that write there is so promising as slasher maniac i expect much from this but what the heck is going on the movie is awful the direction the plot the suspense and the act of the casts is so amateurish i even thought that they are using a home video camera to shot it lucky that it still manage to deliver some good moments to me that make me have to like it thanks for the bad package of so called camp blood br br 1 10
<START> in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of images of abu <UNK> or tales of forced at <UNK> bay <UNK> <UNK> rendition is about as up to the minute and <UNK> a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood it's not by any stretch of the imagination a perfect film but neither does it merit the <UNK> <UNK> it has received at the hands of critics from all across the <UNK> and political spectrum br br the term rendition refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist <UNK> then to <UNK> them away in secret to a foreign country to <UNK> and torture them for an <UNK> period of time all without due process of law <UNK> el is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states he has an american wife a young son and a new baby on the way he seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation <UNK> is <UNK> and taken to an <UNK> location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that <UNK> claims to know nothing about br br on the negative side rendition <UNK> occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character the <UNK> <UNK> point is douglas freeman a rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe <UNK> at the hands of egyptian officials the problem is that as conceived by writer <UNK> sane and <UNK> by jake <UNK> freeman seems too much of a <UNK> boy <UNK> to make for a very plausible agent and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character we know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end he goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within thus without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the <UNK> with story elements flying off in all directions a similar problem occurs with <UNK> wife played by reese <UNK> a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface <UNK> and <UNK> have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are <UNK> in by a <UNK> screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances br br what makes rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two <UNK> running plot lines <UNK> <UNK> into one another in the movie's closing stretches it may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is hollywood after all and the film has to pay some <UNK> to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green <UNK> let alone see the light of day as a completed project br br two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film omar who makes <UNK> the terror of a man caught in a real life <UNK> nightmare from which he cannot <UNK> and who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief <UNK> <UNK> meryl streep alan arkin and peter <UNK> also make their marks in smaller roles special mention should also be made of the warm and richly <UNK> cinematography of <UNK> br br does the movie <UNK> the issues probably does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces most definitely one wonders how the movie would have played if <UNK> really were a terrorist yet the movie has the guts to <UNK> on controversial ground it isn't afraid to raise <UNK> questions or risk the <UNK> of some for the political <UNK> it takes it openly <UNK> the issue of just how does a nation hold fast to its hard won principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being <UNK> terrorist <UNK> and <UNK> by those in power the movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme <UNK> terrorism br br thus to reject rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good rendition may not be perfect but it is good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live and that alone makes it very much worth seeing
<START> it is really a shame that imdb doesn't let you give negative votes this is the most <UNK> awful show ever <UNK> on the american public by our usually likable neighbors to the north the parents are a and a neurotic <UNK> he is as charming as a well used fire with the same <UNK> standards she is a wax museum <UNK> <UNK> with more <UNK> than the entire cast of the view the kids are non <UNK> if female and repulsive beyond belief if male especially the title character the boy is a serious <UNK> for most insanely smug self satisfied arrogant and vain male character on disney which is saying something this show was obviously conceived as the anti brady bunch but it comes off as the anti christ and why is the photography so dark
<START> i know that the original psycho was a classic and <UNK> it was a mistake especially a shot by shot remake i think that that has been more or less <UNK> by the rest of the comments here but there's far more wrong with this movie than just that br br the first problem is the color the original film was shot in black and white but what few people realize is the original was shot after color film had been invented the choice of black and white film was partially a budget concern but it was also a <UNK> choice of hitchcock's now this is not to say that the remake should have been <UNK> in black and white but the colors of this movie are all too wrong the most <UNK> colors in the film are orange and green particularly on marion who is not supposed to be a flashy character the bright colors make it look like a happy movie and when horrific events take place in these color schemes it looks like a cartoon more than anything and the audience is inclined to laugh rather than scream br br the second problem is the lighting this is a dark dark tale which should be <UNK> by dim lighting but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the opposite direction most of the scenes are very <UNK> lit even at times when it is illogical to do so because it's at night br br another obvious problem is vince <UNK> performance yes he does pull off norman <UNK> and madness quite well i don't deny him that but there is one element to the character that he failed to show the <UNK> there should be a certain <UNK> <UNK> to the character at least at first which then fades away once we realize the truth about him beyond being a character <UNK> of norman bates this is a recognized character <UNK> of all <UNK> br br there are a few good aspects of this film some of the performances are great as i said vince vaughn came very close to pulling off a decent portrayal of norman bates viggo <UNK> and <UNK> moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original which was a welcome change anne <UNK> may have been atrocious but unlike janet leigh who was advertised as one of the biggest stars of the film anne <UNK> was given last billing in the opening credits br br i read on the cover of a copy of the psycho novel that gus van <UNK> claimed this was not a remake of the hitchcock film but rather a new adaptation of the original novel i now wish that i had bought that book and saved the comment because after seeing this film that comment is quite possibly the funniest thing i have ever seen there was no attempt in this film to disguise the fact that it was a rip off of the original and it would be far more believable if van <UNK> had tried to tell us that he was really a three ton ape from the planet so many shots were copied exactly without any actual thought as to why hitchcock had composed the original shot in that way such as the scene in which sam and <UNK> are talking while their faces are entirely covered in shadow hitchcock covered these actors' faces in shadow because he thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so nobody could see their awful performances not because of any artistic or <UNK> purpose br br in other words my review is about as pointless as the movie itself in that it <UNK> something that's already been said like everyone else here i <UNK> you don't waste your time on this film and get the original
<START> my god how bad this is who is this <UNK> pretending to be ali g avoid this at all costs it <UNK> the smart multi layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour br br this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo br br one <UNK> here <UNK> that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the <UNK> while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr <UNK> baron cohen could have <UNK> the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline instead we have this mess which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the <UNK> br br terribly disappointing go seek out the dvd's of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> for some real ali g
<START> this movie is really bad there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings <UNK> landscape i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie but the thing is that it is such a bad movie that i can only say that is actually bad michael <UNK> is the only one who saves the money in the film
<START> only the brits could make a film like this and have it be so <UNK> charming betty brenda <UNK> wants something more out of life but she doesn't know what when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend boris alfred <UNK> who owns the local funeral <UNK> meanwhile an american <UNK> christopher walken who wants to put the <UNK> back in <UNK> moves into this small <UNK> community with his assistant lee evans and wants to give boris a run for his money with flashy themed <UNK> star trek funeral anyone brenda and boris decide to stage death and funeral with hilarious results a very enjoyable film if you're a fan of british comedies such as waking ned <UNK> you'll love this
<START> when <UNK> young eddie <UNK> a window <UNK> at department store falls for a statue of <UNK> and gives her a <UNK> kiss <UNK> steps off her <UNK> and gives eddie more than he <UNK> for this <UNK> example of what hollywood can do to a broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the first rate songs the purpose was to make a safe popular movie without too much investment while <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to super stardom robert walker as eddie gets lost in a <UNK> role <UNK> not just naive but <UNK> and hapless <UNK> is gorgeous but the only things that give the movie any life are <UNK> san juan as <UNK> loving but jealous girl friend tom <UNK> as the suave owner of and eve <UNK> as long time wise cracking secretary it's a role <UNK> could play in her sleep and she's good at it br br the musical opened on broadway in 1943 and made mary martin a big time star the only point of a musical however is to have music since one touch of <UNK> was intended to be a social satire of sorts kurt <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> writing the lyrics came up with a series of stylish witty songs and one masterpiece without the satire or the clever songs or martin or an equivalent <UNK> the movie becomes just a weak comedy fantasy where much of the comedy is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death br br not only did the producers of the movie toss out almost all the <UNK> <UNK> songs they brought in the movie's music director ann to write new lyrics for one of the songs that survived turning sharp observation into <UNK> <UNK> romance was no hack she wrote <UNK> <UNK> for me wonder what she thought about while she replaced or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> clever work br br the one bright spot in the movie is that <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece speak low is as great a love song as anyone ever wrote it's given one of those ultra professional and lifeless <UNK> by <UNK> wilson dubbing <UNK> dick contributes a chorus br br as for ann she was one of the few women in hollywood to become a major music director as well as composer and <UNK> writer yours for a song the women of tin pan alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who made it in the business including kay swift dorothy fields and dana <UNK> and for those who would like to hear what little of the <UNK> <UNK> score was recorded by the original broadway cast you might be able to track down the cd one touch of <UNK> 1943 original cast <UNK> song 1946 original cast the music is paired with <UNK> song another broadway show that starred martin
<START> this is as good as it gets br br this is six episodes <UNK> briefly what life may have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth done in the style of a nature documentary this show does away with talking heads instead just gives us the good stuff with the dinosaurs attempting to survive br br certainly this isn't a true documentary since none of what we see on screen can be <UNK> to with any <UNK> but its a best guess and an entertaining one at that here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people this is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs since it will <UNK> them with the oh wow factor to go out and find out more it will also entertain the hell out of them and you br br see this if you love animal shows or nature or science or disney true life adventures except no one really gets killed or just a really good trip to somewhere else run out and get yourself a copy your brain will thank you
<START> this <UNK> romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager but now find rather <UNK> in the case of may september <UNK> <UNK> what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust or an inability to face the reality of aging or both and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she or he lacked as a child these underlying <UNK> seem more pathetic than romantic to me now there is also something rather <UNK> about them br br dick powell looked a bit embarrassed as well he should at playing the elder lover in this silly story he was at fifty attempting the role of a thirty eight year old man <UNK> a teen <UNK> but young debbie reynolds was a <UNK> pretty and <UNK> and full of <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> year old presented as a kind of gift to the morally <UNK> and honest screenwriter as a subject for him to study her spirited performance <UNK> from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve anne francis was cast as <UNK> beautiful but <UNK> fiancée and handled her small role <UNK> br br some of the dialogue was quite amusing too so it's not a total <UNK> br br 5 10

<START> i think that it was just like <UNK> <UNK> except that it was a lot worse than the original the only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all of that geeky stuff everything else is the same she likes a guy that she is too nervous to ask out and later she finds a guy that does like her and she has no clue i think that people need to quit making that same kind of shows and another thing that is the same is that it is always <UNK> the friends are two girls and one guy don't people think that these things get old and tired and these ideas keep being used over and over and yet they keep using these ideas but i do know people who watch this show and i know that they like them
<START> proudly and <UNK> working class porter <UNK> mr b <UNK> is eventually won over by upper middle class family down on their luck father mr i <UNK> for <UNK> for which the penalty was death in those days <UNK> it be forgotten mother the very beautiful miss d sheridan brave and <UNK> loyal and loving and <UNK> older daughter miss j <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> of <UNK> hurt and confused about the fate of her father mr <UNK> like many working people of his time will have nothing to do with anything that he considers <UNK> of charity and it is a key moment in the movie when he finally accepts that birthday gifts he has been given by the children do not compromise his principles although the lovely miss <UNK> has received all the <UNK> it is mr <UNK> and miss sheridan whose performances dominate the <UNK> children they both know how <UNK> society works from opposite ends of the spectrum but there is an <UNK> mutual respect and understanding between them but this is basically a movie about family in an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and hold her to <UNK> and be considered as socially inept rather than <UNK> to live in decent society and when two human beings can beat and kick a baby to death without being charged with murder family may be seen as an old fashioned <UNK> racist even <UNK> concept but a century ago it was the <UNK> that held society together at all levels mr and miss <UNK> families are <UNK> for the age strong and loving sticking together against outside influences integral <UNK> with a moral <UNK> <UNK> in the 21st century what might seem to be a dull preachy political <UNK> is turned by mr lionel <UNK> into a delightful <UNK> to hope faith optimism and courage that all those attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of <UNK> and cynicism is a reflection on our society rather than miss no one with more than a passing concern for the human condition can fail to be considerably moved by this quite perfect movie
<START> this is such an exciting documentary it was by far one of the most fun films i've ever seen i highly recommend it to anyone it's such a fun look at different musical styles exciting people at the <UNK> between modern and traditional that is <UNK> and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in <UNK> and <UNK> watching the film made me want to book a flight for <UNK> right away br br great footage of a turkish <UNK> br br also his sister <UNK> she is awesome br br priceless performances by amazing turkish musicians br br the gorgeous voice of singing in <UNK> br br and amazing <UNK> and <UNK> of a <UNK> gypsy group from <UNK> br br last but not least <UNK> bands mixing turkish music and rock as well as <UNK> music <UNK> <UNK> expressions and others
<START> synopsis kid is not accepted into any <UNK> he creates a college where he and his friends can party by using their <UNK> <UNK> money br br wow a <UNK> to ignorance br br if you believe that we're all ok man then this movie is for you furthermore you must understand that br br 1 kids have it all inside them they just need to let it out br br 2 teaching really the <UNK> creativity that everyone is born with br br 3 someone else should pay for you to follow your passion br br 4 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you take away those <UNK> rules br br 5 <UNK> speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation br br 6 if the board of education allows you to open a <UNK> school with teaching techniques it's because they have your best interests at heart not that they are willing to let go of low <UNK> students who will end up working fast food anyways br br this movie is one in the college comedy genre i e animal house it follows the pattern pretty closely what's new here though is a complete attack on higher education not a parody of the bad elements it's missing the sympathetic <UNK> a professor who <UNK> the worthwhile part of university life br br this lack of balance will doom this film to the back <UNK> of blockbuster it is so one sided that i wondered if it was an ironic self <UNK> take on the whole genre for about one minute the movie has no deep meaning no layers no <UNK> it's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally and what is natural is what the name of the school is s br br never thought i'd say this go see something with will farrell instead his comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated
<START> my ex wife and i saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this film we waited for it to come out but when it did it didn't stay in theaters very long several years later i bought it on vhs and i am <UNK> it to dvd so i can <UNK> it br br i found it to be very moving it is about real events in a real country <UNK> got such a bad reputation for the political <UNK> it created that they changed their name br br i find women with little make up on to be very sexy patricia arquette is in this movie frances and <UNK> gray are in it only briefly br br after coming home to find her young son and husband brutally murdered laura arquette is afraid of blood a bad <UNK> for a doctor her sister talks her into going on a vacation to <UNK> while there she witnesses a peaceful <UNK> and has her <UNK> stolen in a bold or stupid move she asks a tourist guide to show her something off the tourist track her guide is injured by soldiers and she spends the rest of the movie trying to get him and herself to safety br br every time i watch this it reminds me that we in the united states forget that to a <UNK> living under military rule <UNK> where at least eating is virtually guaranteed looks pretty darn good
<START> i have watched thousands of movies in my life and i believe this movie is the most perfect movie that has ever been made by perfect i mean the storytelling the plot the acting the staging the camera work etc this is a lay opinion i have no background in film production a lot of movies have perfect scenes such as the bartender <UNK> a report with the police officer in the movie <UNK> indeed that scene could play well as a short in the dead every scene is done to perfection making the entire movie perfect perhaps john huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie hopefully daniel <UNK> has gotten him out of the contract
<START> easily one of my favourite dramatic tv films in many ways beautiful yet sad heart warming and thought provoking this is a superb <UNK> of a few years in the life of c s lewis and his relationship with joy i found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and <UNK> dialogue and situations it all seemed very <UNK> yet there were also moments that almost leave you breathless with delight <UNK> and bloom as the central characters were excellent as were the supporting cast it's one of those dramas that i find hard to <UNK> simply because for me there is nothing to be <UNK> it just works so well on so many levels br br very highly recommended
<START> i guess i have to write something here although i think my one summary says it all i'm not a huge ted <UNK> fan nothing against the man just hasn't done it for me this covers the sides of <UNK> novel that were never covered before you can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this
<START> in the 1940s <UNK> lake made a <UNK> rise to film stardom thanks to her <UNK> beauty and her highly exploited <UNK> she starred opposite big names like alan <UNK> and march <UNK> screen <UNK> in films like this gun for hire and i married a witch she held her own with female stars as well and she surprised even her <UNK> with her performance as a bitter navy nurse in so proudly we <UNK> but changing times and her own <UNK> caught up with her and by the end of the decade her <UNK> was over with two <UNK> <UNK> behind her and two more in her future <UNK> headed for new york city where she made occasional television and summer stock appearances before dropping completely out of sight it was briefly big news when she was found working as a <UNK> in a second rate hotel in the early sixties but by now her longtime alcoholism and years of hard living had robbed her of her looks without them public interest in her soon faded again she did return to the stage in <UNK> vehicles but her success was minimal eventually she <UNK> to miami florida where she lived in relative obscurity in 1966 she went to canada for a part in an obscure movie called footsteps in the snow which had no u s release the following year she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial feature they approached her to star in their film time is terror and convinced her to <UNK> in the project as one author put it if ever a movie queen suffered a <UNK> <UNK> this was it surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic production values she failed even to rise to a minimal level in this miami florida shot <UNK> looking utterly ordinary in long shots and <UNK> aged in close ups poor <UNK> didn't act so much as walk through her part as a deranged doctor who has hit upon a successful youth <UNK> formula using flesh eating <UNK> she looks both bored and confused her most unintentionally hilarious moment coming when she is forced to ad <UNK> while she struggles to don a pair of rubber <UNK> the supporting cast is no help at all merely <UNK> the plot by talking it to death director brad apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was pointed at them no need for anything resembling entertainment there is admittedly one unintentionally hilarious scene involving a private detective nurse and a corpse in a wheelchair that <UNK> at by almost 20 years according to <UNK> herself the film was <UNK> for three years because no master shots were filmed but in 1970 the production company <UNK> it together changed the title to flesh feast and released it to cash in on <UNK> just published biography and because former leading ladies such as bette davis joan crawford and olivia de <UNK> had unexpectedly <UNK> their careers in horror movies this travesty was promoted as <UNK> comeback film this seems a strange course of action for the filmmakers to pursue though because it's unlikely that the young audience for a horror film of this quality either knew or cared who <UNK> lake was as expected it did nothing for <UNK> career and she died in poverty three years later a previous reviewer <UNK> a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's laboratory <UNK> the <UNK> of bodies from a nearby <UNK> <UNK> the help of a multi talented <UNK> to cut up the body parts poor mrs <UNK> she <UNK> i hope she doesn't mind leaving her body to science try not to think about it <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> away i guess you are right hans concludes the detective nurse what is done is done what a sad end to the career of a still <UNK> remembered star
<START> dubbed beyond <UNK> the hbo version of is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film some scenes simply don't make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading add in the self censorship involving cia <UNK> frank <UNK> and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power here's hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point
<START> behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy get off a train he is arriving from <UNK> to meet his father a man he has not seen in a decade at the train station we meet the man he never smiles br br thus we begin our journey into four friends arthur <UNK> powerful and amazing film you may ask why i began my review that way well that is the way the video box describes the film you may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to get along with this <UNK> man and eventually he will <UNK> away at his cover and expose the kindness br br well if you bought that i've got a bridge i want to sell you you see modern hollywood would make that film penn has always been an <UNK> and has never <UNK> to typical cliched storytelling he always tells interesting stories about people his credits include bonnie and clyde the chase <UNK> restaurant and the underrated mickey one and four friends is no exception br br a typical hollywood film would focus on the boy who is named but steve script only focuses on that for about 4 minutes and then <UNK> him we meet the adult played by craig <UNK> whom you may recognize from body double and nightmare on elm street 3 and his friends tom david and the passionate georgia the movie takes us throughout the sixties now in a lesser film the events would receive the attention but in four friends these events happen but penn and is more concerned with character study than plot and i think the film is better that way we know the events we don't need to <UNK> on them again br br i know i haven't described much of the plot but i don't know if you can describe four friends it's not one of those high concept films that can be described in a single sentence it's a film of many <UNK> and <UNK> it's also a genuinely emotional experience the final twenty minutes of this film moved me to tears i'm not ashamed to admit it rarely does a film have such power that it can <UNK> me to tears the acting is first rate especially by craig <UNK> who seems to be one of the most underused actors working today this is such a difficult emotional performance and <UNK> pulls it off he should have received an oscar for this another great performance is by <UNK> who has an even more difficult role than <UNK> but she handles it extremely well and gives georgia a certain dignity most hollywood actresses wouldn't they'd be too scared to even try they'd be more concerned with image rather than giving a great performance that's not what acting is about she also deserved an oscar br br four friends didn't receive much of a push in 1981 maybe people just didn't have the emotional capacity to handle it and clueless executives couldn't push it as another american <UNK> it lacks the <UNK> of four friends so they let it die too bad for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home i ask you to give this film a chance br br out of 4 stars
<START> in a while <UNK> brings new shows to it's company for the past few years they brought pure gold like <UNK> right back at ya or <UNK> <UNK> power but <UNK> has been off <UNK> is one of the examples br br it's hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show but in truth is pure garbage it revolves around a group who with an over active brain the catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad it may sound good on paper but after watching it you'll realize how far from good this show is br br the pizza guy is an extremely dumb character he's very 1 dimensional there's really not much to him he's hyper active end of story though many feel all the character are a rip off of the south park i think just the contrary from high school is an interesting character and he's able to make me laugh fail to do either of the two br br the cast for the show isn't any better like mom they suffer from lack of character they only stick to one characteristic and thats it the only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to <UNK> whether it's that the scene may actually be funny or you may just <UNK> because how stupid it is br br is a very crappy show from disney <UNK> though it does seem to love some fans it should really be left to the kids
<START> i attended a screening of 'the at the toronto film festival this year while the other reviews i've read seem to be generally and <UNK> positive i must tell you without any kind of axe to <UNK> that this film is <UNK> <UNK> bad the very brave and <UNK> performances by william h macy and maria <UNK> have been horribly <UNK> on what is probably the least polished most clichéd script to have received the green light in years i don't know how bad the brown bunny was but i'm certain it couldn't have <UNK> the <UNK> style depths that this one did as courageous as their performances were perhaps the <UNK> thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay br br he must pitch pretty well in the <UNK> because he should never been <UNK> to be within a hundred <UNK> of a camera the dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that i actually found myself <UNK> during the screening i am <UNK> that the talents of macy have been totally <UNK> in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing br br watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through <UNK> appalling script and ham <UNK> direction was akin to watching a baby seal get <UNK> to death i felt <UNK> helpless and <UNK> all at the same time although i am always glad that there are <UNK> and industry people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises this picture was a total utter fiasco kramer couldn't have been <UNK> to these actors if he had himself taken a steel <UNK> to their knees i hope for their <UNK> they can all avoid similar <UNK> in the future macy wisely <UNK> out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening <UNK> it seems that the bad luck of main character has <UNK> off on the picture in the worst possible way anyone <UNK> to quality <UNK> will likely find it completely unbearable
<START> often when tv series are transferred to the big screen they lose their appeal not in this case the historical accuracy in costumes equipment and general art direction like the tv series is outstanding a good example of comedy and farce with excellent script and comedy actors in the right parts based on a classic tv series that stands alone in british tv comedy history
<START> this movie will not be considered for an academy award but if you enjoy a movie that doesn't take itself seriously and just wants the viewer to enjoy for ninety mins it is not a disappointment you'll enjoy a send up of darth vader for the villain the <UNK> a female batman for the heroine but much <UNK> with much less costume and a running joke that involves <UNK> and the police captain that's very funny not by any means a great cinematic achievement but if you enjoy campy fun it was worth a viewing god help me i liked it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> of kevin smith's silent bob keeps asking for it but writer director christian never <UNK> just can't say no to a joke no matter how cheap the best thing about this movie is its soundtrack of course joey burns of and the divine jonathan <UNK> understated old school <UNK> of there's something about mary fame would grace any small town <UNK> story in visual <UNK> <UNK> lukas looks cool enough riding his <UNK> six series <UNK> two door wearing <UNK> shades going nowhere true he accidentally sleeps with his wild eyed <UNK> kid sister marie but then who wouldn't thumbs up also to how he goes black and white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero zero but if you're looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what <UNK> can do to you i suggest you check out fear and loathing in las vegas
<START> this is the first <UNK> le <UNK> cartoon and in some ways it's very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not while the object of <UNK> affections is a cat oddly it appears to be a boy cat this whole <UNK> occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a <UNK> and tries to smell like a <UNK> so it can be left alone unfortunately this <UNK> our hero <UNK> most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected ending and this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series excellent animation though the style is different than later examples excellent writing and a good sense of humor make this one a keeper
<START> this is slightly less sickening than the first two films but otherwise it's business as usual a <UNK> sleazy and <UNK> slice of <UNK> cinema charles bronson is back <UNK> into action when his friend is killed by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> crime you see is up 11 in the south <UNK> area so what's to be done a stronger police presence <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sentences nope the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to out <UNK> revenge  or as the writers would have it justice this time he's the personal killing machine of police chief ed <UNK> br br the writers bend over backwards to make the hero sending the useless cops into the area only to a weapon from an elderly resident who keeps it for protection and <UNK> a scene in which has his camera stolen and shoots the thief right in the back to applause from the watching crowd capital punishment for <UNK> well okay the attitude of everyone in the film is that this is a solution and the <UNK> <UNK> of the characters into <UNK> who exist only to cheer on or back him up is appalling br br sure these villains are <UNK> but shouldn't the film leave the audience to make up its mind rather than the entire thing towards and his mindless answer <UNK> enough the <UNK> residents don't fear gang <UNK> or blame for any of the violence which is odd as one character is killed precisely because of involvement at the end of the film they all take guns from their <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> join in with the massacre never stopping to think things through or struggle with the thought of having to kill another human being br br the <UNK> shallow performances don't help  bronson has literally one facial expression throughout and can't even put <UNK> on the right words new heights of stupidity are reached here  a machine gun a rocket <UNK>  and new <UNK> of <UNK> the movie <UNK> to every female character in sight whether by rape explosion or throat <UNK> and it sets them up in <UNK> stupid fashion like one victim who <UNK> into the crime ridden gang controlled <UNK> to ask out a stranger or another who goes shopping alone at night this is dreck pure and simple mindless garbage put together without style or sense
<START> the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichés it is <UNK> <UNK> chinese gangsters a female vice president a <UNK> that happens to be big enough to fit a big <UNK> male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent <UNK> independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable <UNK> in a <UNK> the vice president in a nice well <UNK> room surrounded by <UNK> while the chinese <UNK> virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining <UNK> as <UNK> as the slimy gangsters a lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever <UNK> havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons etc etc etc br br the second best way is to count how many <UNK> you need to put after the <UNK> to accurately <UNK> the <UNK> of the film scenario i counted up to 45 a president <UNK> to a meeting on board a private <UNK> the <UNK> non command from the <UNK> box the part where the chinese decided to play shoot 'em up etc etc man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen br br i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil <UNK> gangsters kidnapped the president then the boredom kicked in suspension of disbelief <UNK> and i started thinking the fun i'd have torturing this film
<START> i thought this movie was perfect for little girls it was about a magical place where <UNK> and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most anytime they'd like most little girls would like this story even though there is the thought of death in it although no one dies the king almost does but little girls would not understand it so it adds up to make a perfect story all the events add up creating a great plot that can have a meaning if you dig deep enough this story is perfect for little girls and since it is a <UNK> movie the kids can have more fun with it especially if they have <UNK> of their own anyone can have fun with it though because it is so cute and understandable overall i think this movie is a good movie for everyone especially little girls and will give anyone a smile at least once during it

<START> black comedy isn't always an easy sell every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful like <UNK> for example but usually they don't often find big audiences people seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem there doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both throw <UNK> from the train was a fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age danny <UNK> just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987 br br <UNK> plays an odd <UNK> boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with the mother is played by anne <UNK> who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite a caricature she is loud ugly rude and overbearing though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother <UNK> he <UNK> about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesn't have the guts to actually do it himself that's where billy crystal comes in crystal plays larry <UNK> <UNK> creative writing teacher at a nearby community college larry is a paranoid would be intellectual novelist who claims his ex wife stole his novel and made millions off it he is currently trying to write a new one but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence the night was owen hears larry wish his ex wife were dead during an <UNK> at the school <UNK> and <UNK> the idea from strangers on a train owen decides to travel to <UNK> and murder <UNK> ex wife once it appears he has done so he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother the resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant it's certainly never dull and often full of surprises br br the acting is exceptional even if <UNK> was a bit over the top crystal is as good as he can be and <UNK> has always been <UNK> as a performer the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off beat tone is truly refreshing i have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic <UNK> and down right lazy film making throw <UNK> from the train takes chances both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot how many comedies <UNK> around a son having his mother murdered the film isn't too long and it is chock full of laughs writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone 9 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> i was quite impressed with this movie as a child of eight or nine the gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me and i could see why people would have been afraid of someone like dillinger seeing it as an adult it seemed almost comical <UNK> to the overdone narration and jarring details like thirties gangsters driving cars that looked like they were from the fifties there is a certain gritty <UNK> reality to the way the criminals are portrayed but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera the most memorable and most unintentionally funny bit that sticks with me is the scene where ma barker and her sons are shooting it out with the fbi and the sons are killed the narrator says something like perhaps in that moment for the only time in her life ma barker became a real mother this is meant to be a moment of great tragedy and pathos as ma finally realizes how she's destroyed her family out of her own greed but instead it <UNK> laughter a very odd film that is rarely shown anywhere these days gangster movie buffs might enjoy it but more as a curiosity than a real movie
<START> this is your typical junk comedy br br there are almost no laughs no genuine moments no memorable lines no scenes where you think to yourself that was clever nothing the plot is embarrassingly bad br br it's ugly to look at and boring as hell there is no substance here this movie has nothing it doesn't matter if was in this or not a crap movie is a crap movie no matter who's involved br br also david spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie tv show that he's in br br this movie was dead on arrival there is no life here no fun no intelligence there are plenty of other dumb comedies more enjoyable that this one this film is just pathetic br br 2 10

<START> this movie sucked wind i imagine that the other 300 people that gave this movie such high votes must be independent filmmakers i can't imagine that anyone else could possibly find it funny or even slightly entertaining i feel like 100 minutes of my life were just wasted
<START> this movie was a very good universal monster movie it once again stars <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> and glenn strange as <UNK> monster oh yeah that jerk john carradine is back again as dracula i like every actor in this movie i especially liked <UNK> stevens as dr it's spelled with 2 i thought it was a good idea to have the <UNK> doctor himself doomed like <UNK> was one scene that i think is very good is the scene when dr is in deep thought as he changes everything that is <UNK> him flashes before your eyes the good doctor is saying no while his evil side is saying yes that's the only reason why i didn't want the dracula character eliminated completely from this movie i thought dracula had no business in house of frankenstein if his character was taken out you wouldn't miss him in this film the doctor's blood is <UNK> with <UNK> giving him his <UNK> and hyde curse i hate john carradine and i don't think he should have ever played dracula i didn't mind other actors playing the frankenstein monster after the great karloff because they all did good jobs but when they get another actor to play dracula it stops right there john carradine thought he was so high and mighty they offered him the role of the frankenstein monster once and he turned it down because he thought he was too highly trained i could just picture carradine if he did play the monster arguing with the director on the set i don't have to take this from you i've done shakespeare john carradine wasn't dracula and he never will be sorry john bela lugosi is the one and only dracula thank god they got bela to come back as dracula for <UNK> and <UNK> meet frankenstein br br don't miss this movie it doesn't disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other this is a very good addition to the monster movies if you're a collector be sure not to leave this one out br br
<START> being a fan of marlene <UNK> films i was very anxious to see this documentary i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics that should have <UNK> me off br br the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated you don't even see <UNK> she is heard in the background discussing her movies and this video she does almost nothing but complain about everything what a drag br br the filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> constantly complains himself and <UNK> with her to be on camera all to no <UNK> she just keeps <UNK> to <UNK> after awhile this sort of thing gets really <UNK> with her attitude why would <UNK> continue with this project he should have just told the <UNK> donna to <UNK> it br br regardless of what you read do not waste your time with this
<START> first off let me say if you haven't enjoyed a van damme movie since <UNK> you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion it's worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff
<START> in order to describe what's seriously wrong with this movie it has to contain some spoilers so if you're going to see it and expect to be surprised don't read this br br i liked everything about this movie except the plot and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential it is well acted if a bit slow moving and the camera work and <UNK> scenes are exquisite for a low budget <UNK> picture the dialog is very good br br mason is seriously <UNK> youth who works at a company selling insurance his high school buddy berkeley is his <UNK> and looks after him like a brother despite the fact that mason is quite obviously mentally ill mason has nightmares which send him <UNK> and <UNK> for his <UNK> his visions and nightmares suggest that he has had serious problems with good looking women in his past and the movie seems to be suggesting that he may be a serial killer of women he meets a <UNK> pretty girl named <UNK> and he sketches her in his <UNK> she takes a liking to him and poses for him so he can paint her portrait he sees more of her and begins to <UNK> from his <UNK> state almost becoming halfway human then something goes wrong <UNK> finds with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder she becomes frightened and pulls away we are wondering if her sudden <UNK> is going to push him over the edge his behavior becomes more <UNK> br br this is the setup for the revelation in order to explain how this movie goes horribly wrong i have to explain what happens another spoiler warning in order for this plot to work we have believe that <UNK> a really <UNK> pretty young girl is going to go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who at least at the beginning of their friendship has a <UNK> stare and can only speak in <UNK> or doesn't speak at all he's way beyond nerdy he appears on the verge of total <UNK> yes i know girls can be attracted to all kinds of <UNK> but usually the charles <UNK> type or punk <UNK> guys with some kind of evil manic energy mason is practically a zombie he's hardly there at all any <UNK> young thing would cross the street to avoid him it is just not believable that this girl is attracted to him moreover there is no credible reason for berkeley to <UNK> the crazy mason that just isn't believable either br br but wait there's a revelation <UNK> fails to show up at <UNK> house for christmas dinner where mason is expecting her and berkeley his old buddy has to tell him that <UNK> and all his other former girlfriends the ones he drew in his many don't exist at all she and all the others are merely <UNK> of his twisted imagination he <UNK> them up br br well this explains why a normal cute <UNK> would go for mason she's just a <UNK> of his imagination this could have been the final revelation of the movie with the proper <UNK> and setup but alas it's not at this point mason runs back to his apartment and finds <UNK> there he's <UNK> he kills her but now we are given to understand that <UNK> was in fact real not <UNK> imaginary girlfriend br br in the end after being given proof that <UNK> actually exists and that mason killed her berkeley has to admit that he was wrong that he <UNK> mason this would work if mason had been halfway sane from the beginning but because we the audience always suspected him of being totally deranged and possibly a killer of women it is no surprise to us we suspected what he was all along and can't understand why berkeley couldn't see it but then we are once again left to wonder if she was real why <UNK> would be attracted to the <UNK> mason br br to make the ending worse we are never given to understand whether all the other of <UNK> girlfriends the ones in the were real or was <UNK> the first real one and if the others were real did he kill them too what did he do with the bodies br br the problem is that the filmmakers just didn't know what to do with the material perhaps there could have been a way to <UNK> it out and tell a credible suspense story but this movie is not that
<START> i gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with ingrid bergman lol i really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful even when they are awful because she is in them if it hadn't been her and <UNK> leigh as it had originally been desired i hear i would have given it a 9 0 simply because i love <UNK> but probably not as much as i love ingrid and any other actress would have made it maybe a 6 it's a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad reminds me a little of <UNK> except laced with a more <UNK> attitude gary cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times <UNK> than he probably should be
<START> when hollywood is trying to grasp what an intelligent person is like they fail so miserably finding it hard putting words in the mouth of the <UNK> genius br br right any genius walks around trying to rub in his <UNK> at every instance sure they hang out in bars and pick fights  it's not like they are <UNK> wildly <UNK> <UNK> who never have a <UNK> br br plus if you are a genius you know all about <UNK> and history and politics and of course you're constantly up to date with current events and a <UNK> analysis of them <UNK> these things like all go together n stuff <UNK> br br plus you walk around with a <UNK> all the time you are just a smug son of a you know what that's how it is <UNK> br br and of course you smoke like someone who never <UNK> before but you smoke <UNK> it's like cool n stuff <UNK> and you're different that is understood br br and of course you can fight  you're a bully a bully who finds time to study 10 000 books whenever he doesn't lift <UNK> and whenever he doesn't smoke or drink beer because he follows a strict health <UNK> br br and you date a 30 something college student  <UNK> driver well i won't even comment matt damon team america has hit the nail on the head already br br this movie is a <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> type student in other words 95 of them yeah that's what i would be like if i was a genius but stupid people and stupid authors in this case cannot imagine the lives of geniuses
<START> 1983 was the battle of the bonds that year both roger moore and sean connery starred in two separate james bond film the former <UNK> was produced by the official makers of the bond films while the later never say never again was produced <UNK> by a group led by kevin who held the film rights to <UNK> surprisingly enough is the <UNK> film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that never say never again is a remake of <UNK> br br never say never again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film it all starts with sean connery returning to the play bond for the first time since <UNK> are forever connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in <UNK> are forever the bond of never say never again is the <UNK> and dangerous shark of dr no or from russia with love just a few years older <UNK> delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was the one downside to <UNK> age is his believability especially when it comes to the ladies of the film let's face it even connery despite being in top physical shape looks as odd as moore when he is <UNK> women half his age yet despite this believability issue never say never again shows connery in one of his better bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier bond performances br br kim <UNK> plays domino in one of her early film roles <UNK> plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable <UNK> holds her own against her co stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well in fact she may well <UNK> her <UNK> counter part played by <UNK> br br then there's the villain <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> maria <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is everything a james bond film villain should be suave charming evil and above all believable none the less <UNK> makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other bond villains have fallen into by going over the top <UNK> plays <UNK> with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many <UNK> of <UNK> br br the excellent cast <UNK> into the supporting cast as well barbara <UNK> makes a fine <UNK> in <UNK> and the screen lights up when she appears max von <UNK> a nice appearance as though his appearance is more akin to a cameo <UNK> <UNK> makes an appearance as <UNK> bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film with all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the <UNK> staff from edward <UNK> m who makes for a great contrast to bernard lee pamela <UNK> who make s <UNK> and the <UNK> on the cake with alec wonderful q the supporting cast has a couple of <UNK> though in the form of <UNK> <UNK> as felix and <UNK> <UNK> as jack who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a bond film br br on top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients from the opening central america sequence to the fight at to the underwater sequences and <UNK> chase this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part the film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models explosions and all the things we expect from a bond film <UNK> <UNK> then fresh off doing the empire strikes back brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the <UNK> of nuclear <UNK> and the subsequent <UNK> of the cruise <UNK> br br yet this film is far from perfect never say never again is easily one of the most dated of the bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games while technology dates any film after a time this film's heavy <UNK> on it especially in the <UNK> of the cruise <UNK> and the <UNK> sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release the script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of <UNK> br br yet for its predictability the script for never say never again is pretty good the script sports good dialogue scenes not a single cringe worthy one liner how many of the roger moore era scripts can you say that about some humorous situations and yet is watchable and tense for the most part once you look past he fact that it's a remake there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film br br music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film due to the <UNK> status of the film the james bond theme could not be used that said this could have shown with the right composer that a bond score without it could work unfortunately michael score is far from adequate score is totally out of place in a bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works to make matters worse the film is also <UNK> with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a james bond film br br despite being heavily dated somewhat <UNK> and having a bad score never say never again is still a good bond film with one of the best casts of any bond film good action sequences good special effects good direction and some terrific dialogue this film proves that <UNK> isn't a bad thing in fact it is is better then <UNK> and the winner of the battle of the bonds
<START> <UNK> totally rules in my opinion it's very close to <UNK> five although there are only 7 main characters in the series spaceship included the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship br br what i really love and appreciate in is that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do it's <UNK> they use those lovable crappy rubber <UNK> puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars br br <UNK> is something you definitely want to look into if you already haven't
<START> i remember my dad hiring these episodes on video my whole family loved them and now that i have moved away from home and have my own life i am trying to share these fabulous jim <UNK> creations with my husband and <UNK> but as i am starting to find out not everyone is a <UNK> fan which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series but even though they don't find these interesting i would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the <UNK> you will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were ever confronted with these situations
<START> wow i just don't even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful maybe i should start by just saying that during a <UNK> confrontation between the antagonist and protagonist i had to leave the theater because i was laughing so hard yeah the acting really was that bad the acting was not even the worst part though the plot was almost entirely shown in the previews the characters are all grossly underdeveloped the dialogue and dramatic moments are ridiculous the bad guy is a caricature of an out of control power drunk <UNK> br br but hey the actors are pretty so guess that was supposed to make it all better
<START> wow what a horrible hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now it's just plain silly not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip off of the exorcist to the point where it was re released at one point under the title the sex the only real difference is that the producers have the <UNK> to further <UNK> themselves by <UNK> on the claim that the events in the film are real who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie to make matters even worse there was a video release in <UNK> with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the rocky horror picture show by throwing a pair of lips on the cover how low could one possibly sink do not be fooled by the false claims blatant lies or title rip off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do
<START> i am a gigantic fan of both <UNK> and <UNK> but this movie is just not good the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film i really really wish i had left after that instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film maybe my expectations were too high but i felt let down br br the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh it was good enough though that i'll still probably check out the soundtrack br br but just keep this in mind if you see this film if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it go ahead and split you won't miss a thing because it won't get any better br br i'll even give the executive summary here warning spoilers lots of shots of <UNK> that look almost good enough for a <UNK> commercial shots of smiling people inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax <UNK> wtf were they thinking here some <UNK> babies some <UNK> effects some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water information money and people i think and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence and then a bunch of stock space footage br br i could remake this movie in 10 seconds here's my pitch br br 2 seconds of a happy daddy with a <UNK> head and <UNK> <UNK> shorts playing with a <UNK> playing with a <UNK> playing with string 5 seconds of that scene in network where the guy talks about messing with the <UNK> forces of nature and how money flows in money flows out 1 second of <UNK> <UNK> getting <UNK> with a brick and then 3 seconds of alan bean <UNK> around on the moon br br there you go that's <UNK> minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved of course i'd get a copy of after effects and apply a <UNK> or two so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is if steven <UNK> reading this hey i won't even need much money for this project br br if you insist upon watching a movie about life as war i suggest <UNK> for <UNK> instead it may not have the pseudo intellectual <UNK> so <UNK> among the black crowd but at least it's funny
<START> second nature will not go down as one of the worst tv movies of 2003 but perhaps the worst of all time formulaic derivative and every performance <UNK> in from far far away everyone associated with this project should have a hard time looking in the mirror
<START> it has been a tradition since my first vhs <UNK> for me to collect several of the <UNK> of the old <UNK> by charles dickens and i taped this one and christmas this year fortunately when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the <UNK> hour of 3 am i was <UNK> having to edit commercials from it this was however it's only saving grace br br the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like beverly hills <UNK> in this one a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scrooge like tv talk show <UNK> it wasted <UNK> who just plays bitch <UNK> to the other bitch <UNK> <UNK> spelling who by the way had more <UNK> of paint on her face than some colonial houses and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation br br some of the best opportunities are wasted like the <UNK> of the ghosts aunt entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer but this christmas turkey didn't have one evidently br br <UNK> spelling may be a lovely person but she has all the acting skill of a <UNK> and that makes for a bad show all by itself br br yes it was good to see gary coleman work again but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and <UNK> truly lame dialogue br br and what is most <UNK> was that the transformation from to <UNK> sweet and light is as convincing as a passionate conservative now if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl <UNK> we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol <UNK> br br i suppose if you're a fan of ms spelling and or <UNK> this might be your cup of christmas cheer i'd prefer a stiff shot of <UNK> and a cold beer to wash it down myself this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time br br god save us everyone

<START> five minutes in i started to feel how <UNK> this was looking you've got a completely hero and his overweight fool of a friend seen it all before yeah right i was getting ready to be bored out of my mind for a good few hours this is something i have become quite used to haven't we all then after a few minutes of <UNK> <UNK> insults and such the truck appeared okay the filming techniques used to make it look fast were clumsy but who cares that truck is amazing soon however that is taken away again and we're back to the geek and his overweight friend but now i'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible i then proceed to be amazed again and again by the <UNK> of the film there are so many jokes at their expense it's like everyone in the world is in on this except the two of them the mind behind the makeup and effects was a genius i swear it believe me if you are a man you miss so many of the jokes in this film there is so much here that only a girl can understand br br brother bob is by far the best <UNK> killer that can be found anywhere the fact that he's <UNK> together just adds to the effect there are of course some really dud science facts in here but isn't that always the case when our <UNK> is having a nose bleed and using the blood to lead brother bob to his death now that is rubbish there is no way a nose bleed can be that bad and not mean a severed <UNK> or something i'm all with the use of too much blood but that is taking it a little too far the incest jokes are a little predictable but funny nonetheless and the way brother bob meets his end is more than classic overall this movie rules it really breaks out of the <UNK> melodramatic strain of horror that we got so much of in 2003 2005 the end of this move simply could not have been better br br this is a definite must watch for anyone who likes their horror with several side orders of gore and attitude
<START> with wwii over movie studios quickly rushed to focus on vets returning home the best years of our lives was probably the best example it portrays various people returning home and how they have to <UNK> not only to their pre war lives but to the overall changing world probably the most interesting cast member is non actor harold russell having lost his hands in the war he plays a man with <UNK> where his hands used to be and reminds people that he wants to be treated just like everyone else he went on to win best supporting actor and a special oscar for the role making him the only person ever to win two oscars for the same role there will probably always be debate over whether this deserved best picture more than it's a wonderful life but i certainly think that they did a good job with it very well done
<START> as is frequently the case when manga is translated into live action there is quite a bit lost in the translation however this remains a highly entertaining film the premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet understated style so prevalent in japanese films ha the special effects are a little 70s camp but it adds to the comic book feel of the film i wouldn't recommend this film to everyone but if you are familiar with and enjoyed other japanese horror films like evil <UNK> trap this film will appeal to you
<START> why isn't this movie on the bottom 100 <UNK> is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life i have never before witnessed such a <UNK> mess as this absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done br br nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines like in or out you're worse than a cat and your lady friend isn't a very good poker player she's just revealed her hand br br the <UNK> are a joke even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done it is an insult to the actual <UNK> or any dinosaur for that matter not only that but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to <UNK> and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look <UNK> besides the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away br br i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs maybe the filmmakers didn't <UNK> anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night like i did if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film i would have to quote dr alan grant from the first jurassic park br br just try to show a little respect
<START> there have been many excellent comments about this movie and i want to add my voice to the praise <UNK> <UNK> has never been more <UNK> attractive his major was riveting your eyes just cannot leave the screen when he's on it this is his movie this is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also <UNK> especially deborah kerr and anne jackson as they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances for example i have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time i noticed the reaction of the german girl when she came face to face with a russian soldier even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in germany after wwii and was most likely gang raped by the red army the possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again please put it on dvd
<START> i loved this movie mark <UNK> was perfect for this role more classic sci <UNK> horror films should be remade to this comedy level which is at the very top of the line in my opinion a no drink movie you laugh so hard you will <UNK> it all over yourself can we expect more let's hope so i would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake mel made some remakes of classic films he made some very strong <UNK> a picture of <UNK> gray would be a good suggestion i hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens we are needing a good of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before a good comedy fix
<START> i was disappointed in this documentary i thought it would be about the second chess match between <UNK> <UNK> and deep blue the <UNK> designed by <UNK> computer experts to beat any human chess player <UNK> was and still is considered the greatest chess player ever the movie takes us back to 1997 where had agreed to have a <UNK> with deep blue after <UNK> it 1 year earlier but instead of focusing on the game it focuses more on what happens before and after there are snippets of the game but not very many much of the film centers around paranoid obsession that the match was <UNK> as part of some conspiracy theory and that he lost the match unfairly the movie also includes interviews with people who are not interesting in any way they even chat with the manager of the building where the match took place who cares i also found it very dry and slow ultimately this movie was unsatisfying this is just my opinion of course if you like conspiracy theories this movie might interest you for people not into chess or conspiracy theories this movie would probably have no value i am a chess fan and i only stuck it out because of that i give game over <UNK> and the machine 4 10
<START> br br this film is a summary of <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> death aesthetic search homosexuality all <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> slow paced just to make you to contemplate all its beauty which is in the music and the images as well as in the story this is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy anymore brave deeply personal and intelligent the genuine fruit of a genius like visconti
<START> this is an excellent suspenseful murder mystery movie not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan <UNK> for a couple hours what's not to love also sandra <UNK> is good in this movie i've always been a fan of hers i just wish she hadn't decided to be in the lake house which was horrible but that's another story altogether obviously since there are thousands of other murder horror movies out there there are bound to be similarities between them no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least a few that have already been made anyway this is a great movie for those of you that actually enjoy scary movies it's a little dark and twisted but overall a great movie
<START> if you haven't read <UNK> masterpiece prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever if you have however after having read the books several times over many years i have come to love the characters and story and feel i know it <UNK> i have my own personal vision of the <UNK> <UNK> and the character gallery thus for me the movie was a disappointment why it <UNK> the appearance of the characters <UNK> it changes events it <UNK> important storyline it <UNK> not so important storyline great <UNK> of what makes the lord of the rings what it is is simply ignored even 2001 special effects can't do <UNK> and your own imagination justice peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible and i don't think anyone else could have done it better but the fact remains i regret seeing the movie the next time i read the lord of the rings peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward not my own
<START> what's the point hasn't this been done before better and again why is <UNK> <UNK> wasting his good talents and time with junk like this shouldn't he be shooting a movie somewhere i mean a real movie br br it all felt fake from the beginning <UNK> <UNK> would never have sought to make a film about the <UNK> <UNK> myth at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers so the plot was not believable from the beginning the actors who are supposed to act like they're not acting were obviously acting the story was not interesting the everyday people requisite in every <UNK> were invisible the personalities were stale the jokes were not funny the effects were unconvincing and the ending was nowhere to be seen br br i just don't see the point it's a fake movie about a fake movie <UNK> <UNK> perhaps if those who thought up such a movie sought to make one that <UNK> people who really were out to find a real now that could have had some potential but <UNK> is not a believer and never claimed to be a <UNK> about the crowd would have had so much more fuel br br it was a miss
<START> <UNK> or creatures from the <UNK> as i'm positive it's more <UNK> known as filmed under as the title creatures from the <UNK> appears over a moving image in the same <UNK> type as the rest of the credits starts with five 20 something kids mike clay rogers his girlfriend margaret sharon sisters julie ann wolf dorothy loren an annoying idiot named bobby michael bon whom decide to all fit into a small rubber boat head out to sea don't ask why as i don't know oh the complete idiot bobby left the <UNK> behind never thought to tell anyone so it comes as no great surprise that they end up stranded out at sea without any <UNK> for the <UNK> to make matters worse they become trapped in a thunder storm discover a dead body floating in the water shortly after their luck seems to change when they come across a <UNK> potential safety in a flash everyone boards the <UNK> begin to explore first of all they find a scientific lab with various fish <UNK> computer equipment then down below they find fully <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they find a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who appears mad can't talk they eat fish from the <UNK> which makes dorothy <UNK> up green vomit <UNK> slugs they learn that these fish are living <UNK> of years old have been <UNK> by toxic waste dumped in the sea that they fly <UNK> bite are generally unpleasant to be around i really can't be bothered to go on with this plot outline so i won't here's what i think br br this italian production was produced directed by under the <UNK> al i'd hide under a different name if i made a film this bad too i think <UNK> is quite simply one of the worst films ever there are so many things wrong with this film it's difficult to know where to start first the script by richard is total crap it makes no sense whatsoever is so slow dull it was torture for me to sit through why would five people just simply set <UNK> for the middle of the ocean on a rubber <UNK> barely big enough to fit them all in what were they planning on doing exactly why do we often get point of view shots from these fish creatures but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters as they are never shown on screen even though they are right next to a character how do these fish get around the boat as there is no water for them to swim in people's actions reactions to things are all wrong they constantly split up they make bizarre decisions that simply don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves in some of the dialogue is as awful as anything i've heard i could go on all day about all the plot holes ridiculous goings on but i'll run out of space if i do the fish creatures themselves look awful a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets some really bad stop motion animation at the end the scenes where they interact with the human cast also look terrible with some bad super <UNK> i have heard a lot of comments saying that <UNK> is gory don't make me laugh forget it there is virtually no blood or gore in <UNK> whatsoever there are a couple of slimy scenes when bobby transforms into a fish monster while having sex with julie but it's pretty brief he doesn't kill her he just sort of <UNK> <UNK> on her grows a couple of <UNK> a fish head comes out of his mouth later on <UNK> <UNK> starts to <UNK> some dark <UNK> but that's it we never get to actually see what happens to her or what the <UNK> is dorothy has a fish creature come out of her back off screen control her but again we never get to see what happens to her while margaret commits suicide a very brief shot of a plastic <UNK> stuck to her <UNK> easily the <UNK> scene is when dorothy <UNK> up that green stuff with what looks like <UNK> slugs in it that's it only one person actually dies on screen for the most part <UNK> is quite tame as exciting as watching paint dry i nearly fell asleep it's so boring i can't see how anybody can like this total crap i just can't the acting is awful the dubbing is awful the characters are awful i hated all of them <UNK> is predictably crap as well with an <UNK> budget of only 250 000 all i can say is where did the money go the sets are monotonous dull with one lab a few <UNK> the special are bottom of the barrel stuff including the most fake looking exploding boat ever the cinematography is bland the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension as a whole <UNK> like it's name sake is as low in the food chain as it could possibly be i hate <UNK> it's awful in every single aspect of it's overlong <UNK> minute duration do yourself a favour avoid this one at all costs unless your either a <UNK> or <UNK>
<START> what's there not to like br br i caught this again tonight and <UNK> as to hugh capturing of the essence of philip <UNK> without <UNK> to <UNK> and caricature br br there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life his <UNK> mother his <UNK> issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman br br his poetry is <UNK> throughout and some scenes are caught in his <UNK> of them to the wife of a friend whom he later <UNK> but quite casually almost <UNK> it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him and knew about each other to boot and continued to see him br br cerebral fun loving jazz <UNK> loyal friend it is always more than looks women moved beyond his <UNK> <UNK> and short <UNK> and a beautifully nuanced performance by <UNK> <UNK> as his mum is an added bonus br br 9 out of 10
<START> this is possibly the hands down worst movie every made that actually took itself seriously and not as a result of the acting because being an actor i have to say that <UNK> and <UNK> had to be at their best just to escape needing <UNK> <UNK> therapy after the principle photography wrapped being one of the <UNK> people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release i have to say i have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended credits rolled the house lights went on and no one moved from their seats about five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their <UNK> to look around and i think most of us thought okay we get it that was a joke right they are going to show the real movie now eventually after the handed out <UNK> and we <UNK> an <UNK> of <UNK> to never admit we were there we felt that it was safe to leave praying that we would not be seen leaving the <UNK> i have seen some pretty bad movies in my day i have <UNK> for goodness <UNK> but i am still bitter that i will never ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that i lost watching closet land
<START> did you ever see the film marathon man the part with the dentist i would rather have that happen to me than to sit through random hearts again it wasn't simply uninteresting or <UNK> it was horribly painfully and <UNK> boring at one point i <UNK> lost <UNK> to the average <UNK> i may have appeared to be sleeping but the other movie <UNK> <UNK> realized i actually <UNK> out from the i thought i was going to die when the film finally ended i think it was twelve hours long but i'm not sure i let out an thank you jesus it's over to which all other movie goers <UNK> if i had to listen to harrison ford <UNK> on one more second in that <UNK> <UNK> i would have been forced to search for something sharp to jam in my eye to <UNK> my attention this is <UNK> minutes of my life i will never get back
<START> hello all for what it's worth i'm in a <UNK> program on <UNK> politics and returned this <UNK> after about a year's most of it in <UNK> br br i'm a big movie fan generally so i went out as often as i could and bought tons of local while i was there this one i saw in the theater since it opened while i was there and thankfully closed soon after br br who was the intended audience for this film the spoiled wives and daughters of the <UNK> super elite whose antics are <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the vast majority of <UNK> who could never afford even a single dish let alone a full meal in the film's central restaurant location or gay <UNK> males whose dilemma in the country's muslim dominated society is reduced to <UNK> simplistic how to respect yourself preaching br br if all this wasn't bad enough the soundtrack was either recorded or mixed so <UNK> that even native speaking <UNK> couldn't hear many of the lines br br in brief if you're looking for a cutting edge gay themed film from a region of the world that seems among the least likely to produce such an animal forget it from the early '80s or my beautiful <UNK> from the same era succeed far better in putting a happier face on dealing with <UNK> and do so by showing not telling through <UNK> <UNK> scenes br br overall an unfortunate waste of money in a country that still can't <UNK> all of its children nor keep them healthy
<START> this is really good original ideas in the film and a great terrorist action film only second to die hard and die hard with a vengeance this film has suspense and a good plot i would recommend it to anyone with a taste in films like mine action terrorism and gangster mafia
<START> i first saw this movie when i was very little i was born in 1985 so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big my mother taped it one day thinking i might like it i had never even heard of the <UNK> bright tv show before i was introduced to the movie when i saw it on one of those old <UNK> tapes i loved it i became addicted to it there are people who say it's badly written and all that but it's a kid's movie and things like that don't matter much to children i loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters of course i <UNK> to be them and in the scene where <UNK> first met and they were <UNK> they had to work with the opposite sex i could totally relate the story was the basic good vs evil that children enjoy and there were enough happy moments to balance out the scary ones the world is a fantastic place that would <UNK> the imagination of any young child i am very glad i had an opportunity to see this movie when i was little it made a big impact and watching it now brings back happy memories of childhood i would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie it will trigger their imagination and provide plenty of entertainment you're only a child once so don't let them miss out on this one
<START> the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should br br <UNK> <UNK> 0 10 no stars f
<START> seeing other people is a daring romantic comedy about a couple named ed and alice jay <UNK> and <UNK> nicholson who are engaged and plan to be <UNK> soon they live together but are both having doubts about their relationship alice realizes she's had so few sexual relationships in the past she might just be marrying ed because she's never felt anything else so they agree to begin <UNK> around with other people for a while to test their own relationship br br the movie <UNK> a <UNK> question by focusing too much on the what if aspects of life can it in fact do the opposite and only make you feel more <UNK> when ed begins having sex with a college girl he begins to become addicted and almost forget about alice when he realizes this it scares him br br i hadn't heard anything about this film in advance but i enjoyed it it's not extremely well made and definitely has that <UNK> low budget indie feel to it but it's a lot better than most romantic comedies out there in the mainstream today br br check it out if you get a chance
<START> i don't recall a film which so <UNK> shows the emotional destruction of war as <UNK> in one single marital relationship the focus of the film is the union between <UNK> and von <UNK> the two are in every scene through the course of the film they experience a role <UNK> one has the strength of survival and the other is reduced to emotional <UNK> through dreams both will lose a measure of humanity but one to a greater degree than the other the characters and the viewer go through periods of <UNK> in regards to <UNK> the camera pulls out and away sound disappears words are lost only for the camera to return to <UNK> closeups of its <UNK> <UNK> stars the confusion and <UNK> may make this film hard for some viewers but this is all <UNK> under the master hand of bergman i think the use of a fake war makes the film timeless as relevant today as ever before and by focusing on the human relationship through war makes the film relevant to everyone the pair could be anyone the film is not grounded in place or time but rather in emotion a unique and effective war film unlike any other <UNK> films are <UNK> in presenting human relationships that he would bring this to a war film is masterful
<START> <UNK> jo frost in each episode gives a family the benefit of her hard earned experience but when she's gone will they succeed in sticking to her tough rules or do they face a life dominated by <UNK> children br br following in the vein of british documentaries wife <UNK> and how clean is your house <UNK> gives an in depth look into the private family lives of average people but with the added benefit of practical advice on ways to raise your children br br jo <UNK> a tough love style of child care and the now infamous <UNK> <UNK> has come into the popular <UNK> in many british homes br br in just three short weeks the families featured were turned from a <UNK> house of sibling rivalry screaming kicking biting kids and fighting parents to a <UNK> calm <UNK> of family love br br the series when aired gathered huge ratings and critical acclaim and is currently in talks to be for america
<START> son you must stop the experiments i have started too bad nobody said this too whoever green <UNK> this project i was almost literally dragged to this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high school now a midnight movie in high school on a friday night you are not expecting much but c'mon and upon seeing it again years later i <UNK> stand by my original opinion of it great special effects but so what quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made unless you enjoy blood and guts and seeing some hollywood vets <UNK> hunter make fools of themselves for a buck <UNK>
<START> one of the movies i just didn't want to see i got it in the sneak preview but damn the acting was very bad at the end of the movie i still am surprised i watched the whole movie i wondered why i watched the movie br br also here in the <UNK> the writer of this movie it's filmed from a book of thought it was very bad and was disappointed that his movie came out like this next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast
<START> i just wanted to inform anyone who may be interested that the the movie new jersey drive was my personal favorite off <UNK> i admire the work nick <UNK> and spike lee put into this masterpiece of a movie this movie made quite an impression on me because of its <UNK> and its appreciation of detail of life in urban new jersey it struck a <UNK> with me personally because i grew up with friends like those depicted in the movie it further made an impression with me because i used to spend time in several years ago so some of the characters were kept real at times this movie seemed like a documentary because you didn't know whether or not these were real events taking place although movies like boys in the hood and menace ii society grab more attention i personally feel these movies were somewhat enhanced to appeal to a <UNK> audience new jersey drive was an <UNK> piece of in your face reality lee and <UNK> covered every detail in this urban drama from the music clothing <UNK> and location unlike some of the movies i mentioned earlier the actors performed as if they weren't actors nothing was <UNK> in order to make good theater the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it i look forward to more works of art from nick and spike in the hopefully near future
<START> a huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track i can't say it was riveting entertainment nor a cure for insomnia nevertheless i enjoyed the film it provided the escape i was after one afternoon a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life albeit a fantasy expect some corny moments few thrills and an occasional laugh
<START> undoubtedly the least among the spaghetti westerns i've been watching lately basically a low brow rip off of <UNK> the good the bad and the ugly 1966 with three <UNK> characters one another and occasionally <UNK> shaky <UNK> in their search for hidden gold leonard <UNK> rated it a bomb while it's harmless enough it's also totally routine and <UNK> the three main roles are stereotypes that is to say uninteresting eddie <UNK> is a bank employee with ideas regarding his being transported by train gilbert <UNK> is the legendary but <UNK> mexican <UNK> his frequent <UNK> into spanish when excited are quite corny who apparently is still irresistible to women george hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to <UNK> clint eastwood's man with no name figure director <UNK> whom i saw at the italian b movie <UNK> held during the 2004 <UNK> film festival where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present shows little genuine feeling for the western on the strength of two above average franco <UNK> efforts in the genre i ordered his collaboration with <UNK> <UNK> 1976 i'm keeping my fingers crossed now and the film's tongue in cheek approach is equally <UNK>
<START> although it is more of a kids movie it still holds its own especially when compared to the more recent <UNK> line animated films being made the music is fantastic i don't care how old you are you will still find yourself to girls of rock and roll and diamond dolls <UNK> a must for animation lovers
<START> reading some of the other comments i must agree that some of the very few shortcomings found in this brilliant documentary about one of the 20th <UNK> <UNK> up there with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> smith edith <UNK> judy garland and <UNK> de <UNK> are justified because initially this was a 6 hours plus tv documentary about her career <UNK> de <UNK> v 1995 1999 far more <UNK> and with greater insight into inner world as for the <UNK> her songs i'm all for it though the music the voice and the performance may be are universal there is so much poetry in the words just begging to be translated i think this was a conscious choice by the producers they were aiming at the 200 million portuguese <UNK> in brazil <UNK> <UNK> france east cape <UNK> guinea <UNK> canada the us south africa st <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> germany and the rest of the portuguese speaking <UNK> worldwide as for the lady herself she did not live to see this particular <UNK> dvd version of the documentary but she was given a preview of <UNK> de <UNK> and it seems to have been to her liking very much so
<START> having grown up with <UNK> i <UNK> both the scarlett sequel book and the mini series until now when i recently viewed the video for the first time i was amazed how much i enjoyed watching timothy <UNK> depiction of <UNK> butler and <UNK> <UNK> as scarlet i feel scarlet should be judged on its own merits rather than attempting any comparison with the <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> while the scarlet story line and some of the dialogue suffered from lack of inspired writing overall i thought this was a worthwhile <UNK> of what might have been between scarlett and <UNK>
<START> i watched this film with a sort of dangerous fascination like a <UNK> trapped in the <UNK> there is no doubt that even if you enjoyed it it's a bad movie but the important question is why it has a good cast it's lively it's prepared to tackle sex head on with some of the characters actually getting some of it here and there which is unusual for a british comedy it also has johnny vegas and <UNK> crook <UNK> performers agreed but they've have had their moments in the past br br what it's <UNK> lacking is charm the characters are <UNK> idiotic unbelievable and <UNK> so that instead of a film of men behaving badly the producers have made game on any mediocre writer wanting to make a film about the sexual attitudes of sexist british men would have got hold of a few copies of loaded <UNK> or even <UNK> to read sid the sexist and the thing would have written itself instead the producers clearly tried to make up some moronic difficult to care about characters character comedy as opposed to slapstick etc only works if the audience can <UNK> some human truth to the situation but watching this film is like being told an annoying joke that you know is not going to end up funny but you can't stop it br br sadly the film is also poorly made the plot structure is weak there's little character <UNK> or development and many of the scenes aren't funny time after time the same lame <UNK> <UNK> in to <UNK> scenes <UNK> and <UNK> there's a lot of needless <UNK> when you've done one joke about parking outside a sex party you don't need to do it again one wonders what the uk film <UNK> saw in the script br br this is a world where most men are <UNK> and most women are continually up for it the apartment and <UNK> much the same world view but the producers of this film accept it without criticism thus they've ended up with a kind of inferior update of <UNK> of a window <UNK> somebody british needs to have another go at this kind of thing and do it properly  a good next project for simon pegg and edgar wright i think
<START> normally i love finding old and some not so old westerns i haven't seen to be the entertainment for the evening it's such a great way to sit back relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours but this was not to be the case with this version of the magnificent seven the casting and storyline of this series closely follow the hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment good old get your mind right <UNK> history where the <UNK> <UNK> must all be white male <UNK> in this case and preferably christian if it can somehow be worked into the script it's sad really the best movies out there are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen not about <UNK> someone's political ideology
<START> i watched the pilot episode for this one with high expectations having just <UNK> college and moved on to real life i was not in a <UNK> but a lot of my best buddies were and i got to <UNK> in a lot of the <UNK> that they did in their house so i know what goes on to some extent br br this show is obviously a <UNK> not a documentary in any way of greek life or college life for that matter although it does hold a lot of truth albeit exaggerated for the most part if you watch the show for the value it contains as a tv show and nothing more it is very entertaining much like movies such as old school <UNK> animal house etc if you watch it expecting it to <UNK> all of your experiences in your own college life you will probably either be left wanting more or mad that they over <UNK> a lot of events
<START> i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful like what dreams may come or the truman show or something well they were selling it off for <UNK> 99 in my local <UNK> and it had <UNK> <UNK> on the cover you know you cant help but love him and so my friends <UNK> me to buy it and i was sure it was going to be trash maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie because my standards were never that high
<START> bob <UNK> 'the <UNK> <UNK> is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour looney tune previously looney tunes were all black and white while <UNK> <UNK> were in colour the tale of a singing dancing <UNK> attempts to woo a lady cat and a <UNK> attempts to catch the cat 'the <UNK> <UNK> lacks the trademark energy and pace of most <UNK> shorts to be fair <UNK> doesn't have a great deal to work with warren <UNK> script is embarrassingly thin and while he has <UNK> straw into gold with other cartoons <UNK> doesn't manage it with 'the <UNK> <UNK> it's often said of <UNK> that you can't mistake his cartoons for anyone else's and it's generally true but 'the <UNK> <UNK> is an exception there's flashes of <UNK> genius such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog hey are you following me when the dog <UNK> that he is the cat simply says oh and the chase immediately <UNK> unfortunately there's very little of such brilliance on show here knowing who directed it 'the <UNK> <UNK> is a bitter disappointment we all have off days and this was clearly one of <UNK>
<START> first when does this storyline take place it has to take place after the first movie because knows and has her third child but it can't take place after the second movie because doesn't get a girlfriend or wife or something you never see her in the show br br also why is going to school the whole plot of the show is that is going to school so that he can be emperor but wasn't he emperor before this and who's emperor while he learning to be emperor shouldn't that be or was fired in this time line already and if that true why is waiting for him to fail to become plus you know in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private <UNK> so he should kinda know what he's doing br br why is a student he's around 25 they stated that in the first movie he's an adult going to high school does everyone think he's a moron i really like but i think because of his age and because everyone know that he is working for he should have been a teacher being a home <UNK> teacher would be right up his alley br br is very unlikable she suppose to be love interest moral <UNK> but a lot of time she comes off <UNK> and know it all she <UNK> says thinks i like i should be proud because i am pretty and smart br br she has <UNK> when it comes to and knows whenever he's in trouble when he's cheating or even when he sings the hot hot <UNK> song in his head even though she does cheer leading school newspaper and keeps straight a in all of her classes br br she seems more interested in using her <UNK> to get to do the right thing and do well in school then dating him in fact she seems more <UNK> to then a love interest br br as i bought up before is trying to get to fail so she become not sure how that's suppose to work with being fired and all seems to be <UNK> the first movie in every episode in almost every show that she appears in she turns into an animal in hopes of having him fail a class there are only 3 times that i can think of that that didn't happen the jokes about being old aren't as clever in the show as they were the movie and classic jokes about are used to death in the show like the pull the level roller coaster and the lab br br also some other points that don't make sense in this series the fact that whenever is assigned something everyone acts like this assignment will make him pass or fail the class but he seems to pass every assignment given to him so why does one assignment matter so much br br seriously who is <UNK> the kingdom while this is going on do they have a <UNK> or a <UNK> you never see anyone <UNK> the kingdom unless has his powers back or is br br why is going to a normal <UNK> school shouldn't he learning about how to lead a country what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future i could see taking some normal classes on like <UNK> so he would know how to prepare the country for a <UNK> or something like that but <UNK> <UNK> how is that helpful br br now i know that someone is going to say but it not suppose to make sense it's suppose to be funny then they should have more funny things in there all the funny things about the show have been done already in the movie also if they notice some of these huge plot holes why don't they poke fun at them like in the movie for example when and get to the secret lab before and and and can't explain how they got their first br br there are some good points it is nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like and monkey with the bug and his family are still very good characters with a good down earth feel i feel that this series would be amusing for younger children br br in conclusion the series is not as good as the movie that it based on but it may good for younger children
<START> this film <UNK> with mike comic book mini series red rocket seven and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for which ties into the book of revelations and the this is only part of a bigger story if the movie <UNK> you read too you can easily tell that is used to telling stories with pictures the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a 500 budget unfortunately mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act also mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books 4 out of 10
<START> i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was the initial <UNK> was promising but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful let's run through the main points plot good initial idea but truly terrible development there were many points when i thought no nobody would do something that stupid the ending was amazingly <UNK> characterisation all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures i keep trying to think of one that wasn't possibly the mother but that's it music <UNK> inappropriate and generally terrible direction totally amateurish cinematography doubt they've heard of it camera angles <UNK> zoom levels often really bad i am totally <UNK> at how this film has scored so highly it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years if not ever
<START> graphics is far from the best part of the game this is the number one best <UNK> game in the series next to underground it deserves strong love it is an insane game there are massive levels massive characters it's just a massive game waste your money on this game this is the kind of money that is wasted properly and even though graphics suck thats doesn't make a game good actually the graphics were good at the time today the graphics are crap who cares as they say in canada this is the fun game <UNK> you get to go to canada in well i don't know if they say that but they might who knows well canadian people do wait a minute i'm getting off topic this game rocks buy it play it enjoy it love it it's pure brilliance
<START> i haven't seen this in years but when i was about 6 i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least 10 times now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some <UNK> terrorists taking a <UNK> school hostage with demands for the head terrorist the <UNK> father to be released from prison now i could just check the plot here on imdb but i'm pretty sure thats right any way a group of boys at the school decide that they're not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back this film has always been stuck in my mind there are so many images that i haven't forgotten like <UNK> i think death scene or billy spitting in the terrorists <UNK> or the one kids no idea of his name fake <UNK> attack just a great film it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic guys getting <UNK> down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a <UNK> not sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the end and the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting <UNK> in the head in gory detail great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience i've got to watch this again after all these years
<START> i only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so i'd know what not to pick up not only do i get the original title but i come to find terror hospital is one of seven more <UNK> this one is a real <UNK> movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly <UNK> consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement this has none of that instead the viewer is witness to <UNK> unnecessary and way too convenient for the situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters <UNK> moving from room to room and all this is half of the film forget trying to figure out where anybody is or who they are during <UNK> or <UNK> scenes too you probably won't care anyway there is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old <UNK> ed movies i er i mean sat through and watched way back in high school really we're talking about <UNK> possession and a killer on the loose here not a bad recipe for trash cinema unfortunately there's nothing here to make it even good trash when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not so special effects are just that bad acting and not so special effects this one's just trash pure and simple leave it on the rack at the <UNK> shop or in that box at the yard sale there's a reason its there
<START> this movie and i say this lightly is nothing but pure trash i feel sorry for those people that actually wasted their money to go see this in theaters i saw a <UNK> of the movie from a friend and i've <UNK> it ever since br br as a black woman i am extremely embarrassed to have seen this more so i am extremely horrified that people of other races may have seen this as well and might believe it to be behavior of black people in general it's full of stereotypes against all <UNK> and <UNK> horribly vulgar coarse jokes and lame one liners out by somewhat well known african american comedians who should have known better after reading this script i must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers <UNK> that <UNK> the movie like it was an overlong music video they had absolutely no place in the movie i guess they were the <UNK> singing <UNK> horrible br br the writers producers and whoever had the stupidity to <UNK> this movie should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this crap <UNK> for the rest of their lives do not watch this movie it's time wasted out of your life that you can never get back
<START> charles bronson is back in his most famous role in my opinion this is by far the best film of the series and my favorite movie ever this movie doesn't take itself seriously because the filmmakers knew that all the social commentary that was necessary was put across in the first film <UNK> and <UNK> made this film for bronson fans not for the critics and it works has been unfairly criticized as trash and a weary entry in a worn out series these statements would be true if the film was made to be taken seriously or to spread a statement but it wasn't if you take it as what it is is just a fun action packed romp with charlie doing to street <UNK> what we all wish we could do the action is non stop the atmosphere is great and the movie is just out and out the best bronson flick ever made you can tell that the penny <UNK> cannon group spent a lot of money on this one it is believed that bronson thought this film was too violent and that was the reason why winner didn't direct any of the following entries i can understand his concern but as is always the case of sequels you have to push the <UNK> even further to pass a previous entry in any case this movie was no more violent than any other movie made during this time what makes the best of the series and my favorite film ever not the best just my favorite is the action charlie's presence memorable villains and it's ability to get the viewers to jump on the <UNK> the first film may be the most technically well made but this one is the most fun for once charlie actually has some clever lines although he doesn't say much and a halfway interesting story photography action and direction to back him up charlie has never been more intense or super cool than in this one yes it's <UNK> maybe it does promote stereotypes and maybe it is the same story as before but <UNK> films always have and always will stand for defending the common man and giving his audience what they want to see many argue that the <UNK> series <UNK> its' audience my <UNK> is that the movies don't manipulate us the fans are the ones in charge we demand that bronson blow away deserving <UNK> and in turn winner and co deliver the goods and for those of you who still want to put it down remember a few things was the 1 movie in america when it came out and was among the viewing favorites of millions of people on video and television because they realize that not all films have to be epics they just have to be fun 10 you can't get any better john <UNK>
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 palm springs international film festival i went in with the <UNK> that if it stars and <UNK> <UNK> it had to be at least decent well after a kind of a slow start i was far from disappointed in fact i was quite pleased with the final product br br i must admit the and <UNK> english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing waking ned <UNK> <UNK> or any other film with heavy <UNK> actors i <UNK> after about 15 minutes and i was trying to figure out why <UNK> <UNK> was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a <UNK> to them br br i know it's a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a <UNK> of a truth and <UNK> trial i'd heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didn't really know how it worked br br the final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived this was overall a very strong film the closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders
<START> what a tribute to his father he set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of and by the end of the journey i believe <UNK> <UNK> is content with what he learned and personally felt the film is 5 years in the making and a quarter of a century after his death louis i <UNK> total commitment in his work consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son <UNK> in the documentary my architect a son's journey br br the film is by no means an anthology of <UNK> work there are plenty of books and <UNK> <UNK> that have records of louis <UNK> projects and buildings this documentary works like a mystery writer director and co producer <UNK> <UNK> was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father br br the film is in chapters in heading west we're at the <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> studies at la california it's a sight worth <UNK> <UNK> integral concept of building and environment light for the scientists at work is amazing from a former colleague who worked with 35 years ago we hear about his <UNK> attention to detail also how he could be certainly didn't <UNK> words in his criticism a memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see <UNK> <UNK> around at the <UNK> area of the <UNK> <UNK> a tiny figure like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands br br the immigrant segment brought us to meet anne the architect who worked with and also bore him a daughter alex now at 80 return with film crew to the bath house project at <UNK> new jersey was nostalgic in go to sea we get to see the <UNK> for american wind <UNK> orchestra all made of steel and meeting robert who was surprised by <UNK> when he finally told him he's son was touched he said he had seen <UNK> when he was six with his mom harriet and he was not to tell anyone that lou had a son it was a emotional moment of reunion br br like his father the <UNK> <UNK> traveled to <UNK> and learned about the <UNK> project that his father began but not realized he visited the <UNK> wall and seeing his kept falling off being <UNK> his head gave me a sense that he need not be jewish to be his father's son we continue with sitting down with his two half sisters at the family matters segment we also hear him <UNK> with his mom at <UNK> and from talking to previous office <UNK> at his father's office we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there sleeping on a carpet on the office floor <UNK> and all br br the end of the journey brought us to india to the indian <UNK> of management building talking with architect b v was a revelation in the end <UNK> found a very much alive louis <UNK> his father his spirits live within him this documentary is very much a tear <UNK> for me i was <UNK> eyed most of the time it was very touching and am in awe of the man the architect and his son and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings louis i <UNK> wanted to give his love to the world ' <UNK> work and three families you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going as <UNK> the architect at the capital of <UNK> complex completed 9 years after death so <UNK> noted louis <UNK> has given the people of <UNK> a lot spending time at <UNK> understanding the culture of the place and people as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved and for such a dedicated man usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing it seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices br br this film reminds me of king <UNK> the <UNK> 1949 good dramatic story in b w with music by max <UNK> based on <UNK> novel with gary cooper as the <UNK> architect who stands by his own ideals and patricia <UNK> as the parallel supportive woman in his life br br
<START> it must be remembered that the <UNK> movies like many of the first series <UNK> films were in fact aimed <UNK> at kids little kenny and his <UNK> are living out the <UNK> of the kids in the audience they get to run around and play with top secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it they get to <UNK> with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real danger br br perhaps the first <UNK> film is an <UNK> because the child does get <UNK> and is put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish <UNK> br br as one critic said these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies
<START> this dvd will be treated with indifference by of classic rock music <UNK> across the world because rush just aren't cool it is a shame that rush have had to overcome <UNK> disdain from the majority of north american and british music <UNK> over their thirty odd year history as this has <UNK> many people the chance to get into a real band each of the last four decades are well represented here and what a <UNK> of songs it is we have the <UNK> the magical the trees and the lyrical tom <UNK> interspersed with the high energy genre challenging pieces from their latest album <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is almost flawless the stage show is spectacular and the brazilian fans are just plain crazy at one point they sing along to an <UNK> each band member plays at a level that defies belief real <UNK> performing art if you doubt this try out the la villa or the rhythm method for size and yes the latter is a drum solo which has to be seen to be believed br br sound and vision production values are very high as <UNK> the rush experience and you also get a documentary and multi <UNK> set pieces to boot br br this is an astonishing performance and tribute to the canadian <UNK> and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy
<START> the beginning of this movie had me <UNK> that it would be little more than a typical b sci fi flick but as it progressed i began to get interested and i saw the whole thing through the premise is interesting original and has the <UNK> of making a classic alas it instead ended up a mediocre movie done in by the usual factors which turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie bad acting low budget etc i'm interested to see how this would turn out if it were remade with good actors and a big hollywood budget
<START> sorry folks this is without a doubt the worst film i have ever seen sometimes when a movie is really bad you can joke about it and have a good laugh like plan 9 from outer space this movie is so bad you <UNK> even enjoy it on an ironic level
<START> i caught 2 <UNK> at the <UNK> fest in los angeles it's a very well shot first film though the <UNK> format begins to show itself in outside scenes and i'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school in other words every side of high school but the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the promise there are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be there's no depth to these caricatures beyond the <UNK> of i am troubled teen x i have y problem the perceived roles of men and women in this story are <UNK> <UNK> br br let's start with the men you have the <UNK> kid who's gay the jock who's also gay the boy who rapes his sister and mr as the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually <UNK> and violent toward women and themselves naturally or <UNK> as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women and themselves i'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow <UNK> them yet neither took place and that's all there is to these characters' stories br br next the ladies one young woman wants to be a <UNK> housewife another is the pregnant of the sister <UNK> brother and there's the girl who kills herself i'll get to that later again i don't think there's a <UNK> of political correctness for filmmakers i'd be out of a job were that the case but i do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story if that <UNK> were being used to reveal something about character other than i'm a teenager and life sucks i'd be happy as a <UNK> but nothing new is revealed nothing is <UNK> or changed or <UNK> br br finally the girl who kills herself this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling we're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film we've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story it's cheap exploitative and sloppy despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to earn something like that you can't simply purchase it on credit so this suicide happens we get wrap ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends what have i learned i already knew high school sucked been there done that i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women i already knew that kids with <UNK> are <UNK> br br what else is there then smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves oh and the <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> i've seen in a while
<START> how is it in this day and era people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart such as 'the war at <UNK> it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it there are no jokes only half jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile the acting is your typical <UNK> idiotic standard sitcom <UNK> limbs type acting and why oh why did this crap replace arrested development well you gotta hand it to fox they know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers you see the reason arrested development wasn't <UNK> popular was because it was so smart it was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb and of course if a dumb person encounters a smart person the dumb person will hate the smart person most of the time anyway either that or try and off of the smart person if you like this show and are one of the dumb people i truly cannot <UNK> what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds i cannot <UNK> what it must be like to be mindless laughing <UNK> influenced by every little thing basically people who laugh with a laugh track are <UNK> trained <UNK> mindless <UNK> maybe i shouldn't insult <UNK> by comparing them to you you know who you are if i seem like a in this review it's because i'm so annoyed at ad being canceled
<START> if you were ever a fan of mtv s the state then these three guys will be familiar to you but even if you only stumbled upon them via the internet like i did you will soon come to appreciate their unique brand of comedy br br born out of their stand up comedy trio michael ian black michael and david <UNK> produced these brilliant vignettes of surreal comedy to display at their shows and now after being available only to <UNK> from two <UNK> they appear in <UNK> glory on one dvd br br think comedy sketch show sans censorship and you'd be halfway there no stone of decency is left <UNK> but for those who like their comedy rude self indulgent and <UNK> on <UNK> and i mean that in the most <UNK> way this is the dvd for you br br i think it's worth the money for the commentary from the two michaels and david alone you can't help but take a liking to them as they explain their actions cringe at their own antics with sex toys and by turn pat each other on the back and <UNK> abuse br br fantastic br br it must say something for the appeal of stella that the likes of julie <UNK> and paul rudd are willing to throw themselves into the action so <UNK> and you should follow their fine example throw <UNK> to the wind and prepare to laugh yourself sick
<START> i saw this movie in its brief run in art house cinema in <UNK> i found it so funny that i literally spent part of the movie on the floor having laughed so hard i fell out of my seat in retrospect years later i thought it had been done by <UNK> van <UNK> when i mentioned it to a friend he said that a friend of his downey sr filled virtually every non acting role in the flick director writer producer etc he was right of course and my memory was wrong except that this was one of the movies ever made the part of the arab was particularly priceless
<START> an orphan boy named tom tommy who works for a pair of shady <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> accused of stealing from the mansion where he is working at by mr james mason the real thief and goes on the run <UNK> only <UNK> is the niece of the <UNK> owners samantha gates a <UNK> blue eyed blonde with long <UNK> hair who i'm sure was the primary reason why i repeatedly watched this as a boy he and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into water breathing cartoon characters while underwater he befriends and <UNK> a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark br br a very interesting and always fascinating fable set in <UNK> that should appeal to all children the animation <UNK> minutes of the 85 minute hbo vhs print is just average but it's <UNK> to most modern day animation even computer animation my only real <UNK> is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene at <UNK> <UNK> after the first <UNK> of high the film cuts to a scene with swimming followed by tom and encounter with <UNK> this leads to a scene in which the killer shark voiced by mason leads our heroes into a trap the shark then <UNK> tom with young tom so nice to see your ugly <UNK> again but this is the first time in <UNK> print that tom meets the shark most reference books list the running time as <UNK> or <UNK> minutes and it was previously available from <UNK> entertainment and nelson so it's very likely that <UNK> print is edited and or time <UNK> adding insult to injury mgm released a <UNK> <UNK> minute print on dvd in 2002 let's hope a restored version appears in the near future br br the film is <UNK> films 1978 is the water baby voiced by samantha gates bernard <UNK> who plays <UNK> partner in crime also voices the electric <UNK> a k a slip slide adventures
<START> not to be mistaken as the highly <UNK> samuel l jackson vehicle snakes on a plane snakes on a train is low budget features no actors to speak of but some pretty decent visual effects an attractive young woman julia <UNK> does not want to marry choice for her husband so she is put under a powerful <UNK> curse that has snakes <UNK> inside her body slowly <UNK> from the inside out her only hope for survival is a <UNK> who lives across the border in texas time is running out for her and she is put on a train from el <UNK> to los angeles before long the snakes are leaving her pain <UNK> body and rapidly growing in size the passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be <UNK> for the snakes the finale sequence is no doubt the best of this <UNK> minute flick also receiving acting credit are castro al and <UNK>
<START> i'm a fan of the horror movie regardless of which <UNK> it comes from i know what to expect from the west the east and most horrors in the middle so i received the dvd of in the post and looked forward to a slow build of ever increasing tension and scary children with odd disjointed movements hiding under br br the major selling point for this film was that it has a far more linear story line than many of this <UNK> you get who the characters are where they are from and what they do you get the <UNK> information nice couple can't have children and realise that the premise is just too normal for something freaky not to happen br br and then comes the bad the number one complaint is that the story is obvious i got it pretty much the moment the kid <UNK> the tree i knew where the film was going and was even able to predict the order of death and for what reason br br the editing is shocking and unfortunately not to the benefit of the film even were i still <UNK> the events tension isn't allowed to build because the director seems to have gotten a new editing <UNK> for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible br br and my final <UNK> is this the tree was unnecessary this would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror with just the couple breaking down over the death of the child the titular tree bought nothing new or exciting to the film so i'll finish where i started my overall impression was <UNK> '
<START> if this is not my favorite movie of all time it definitely is in the top five i love this everything about this is perfect the clothes the set the lines yes they're not how normal people talk but right down to the small scenes especially at the beginning of the office girls changing their shoes picking a <UNK> <UNK> the office <UNK> plant putting lunch in the <UNK> identical to what us office girls do today in the year 2005 i think all the minor characters are wonderful if someone like joan crawford is over the top it's all part of the package if you pick out many things in the movie it is very evident that this was the beginning of the sixties as women were starting to not take it lying down at least not if they didn't want to as far as characters being <UNK> for instance <UNK> <UNK> character acting like she's all for <UNK> but then getting too attached to louis character isn't that what many people are like <UNK> they mix in real stuff with scenes like diane <UNK> character finding the love of her life after her <UNK> baby in an accident lying in the hospital with a big old <UNK> around her head this is part of the package too it's charm glossy <UNK> i like the mix of real stories <UNK> today the stereotypical career woman who only has affairs with married men therefore doesn't have a family when she is older with ones that make you wish ah if only i could fall in love with a doctor and he'll love me even though he knows my <UNK> past and saw me all messed up after the <UNK> accident also i just got the dvd widescreen it's yet even more beautiful than full screen <UNK>
<START> one of the worst films i have ever seen but extremely funny not on purpose though every scene that contains anything to do with aircraft romance script or acting is badly messed up br br i recommend this film for all pilots it´s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film also see airport <UNK> the <UNK> for the same reason br br anyone else avoid this film like the plague except for fans of b movies of course br br enjoy
<START> the plot is predictable it has been done many times in other movies you have competing summer camps in this one the rich kids vs the <UNK> competing for <UNK> rights in the typical camp <UNK> while the kids and pursue pranks sex and a good time are you ready for the summer <UNK> is the first and best summer camp movie for feel good comedy as others have posted it's no citizen kane but this type of movie isn't meant to be the film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one liners of bill murray his scenes with a <UNK> where he tries to raise the kid's self <UNK> are very good <UNK> one liners throughout the film are very funny br br i also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other teens at camp movies today there is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two <UNK> words in the entire film but <UNK> is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd it's rated pg br br this is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes when bill murray is on the screen or making one of his classic <UNK> <UNK> you are drawn to the film bill seems to carry the movie all by himself but he does it so well that when you see <UNK> you will realize that this is the film that made him a star a side note to this review is to avoid all of the <UNK> movie sequels they are horribly bad
<START> it's taken years for cult icon bruce campbell to get this project off the ground but he finally has it's here and what a great piece of schlock entertainment it is looking at the plot it sounds like two things a great base for a very silly b movie and a shameless excuse for bruce campbell to what he does best evil dead ii style slapstick humour and this film delivers on both counts the man with the screaming brain is comic book nonsense all the way through but there's some really great scenes and it's almost impossible to be bored with this movie bruce campbell wrote directs produces and stars in this film and while it's not quite citizen kane it has to be said that this is an achievement for the man most famous for battling off his own hand in a <UNK> cabin the plot follows american businessman william cole on a business trip to <UNK> with his girlfriend the trip goes awry however when he his girlfriend and his taxi driver end up dead thanks to the same woman mad scientist <UNK> <UNK> is on hand to <UNK> cole and the taxi <UNK> brains into one and we've got a cult flick on our hands br br the first half hour or so is entertaining and features a few laughs but once the main plot point has been executed the movie really picks up bruce makes best use of the scenario in all kinds of silly situations from changing his clothes in a waste bin to deciding with the taxi driver in his brain what to eat in a restaurant the humour is mostly of the slapstick variety and anyone who enjoyed evil dead ii which should be anyone who's seen it will no doubt enjoy this too it does feel like campbell is playing to his strengths a little bit too much with this whole project but if you tuned in and didn't see bruce doing what he does best disappointment would ensue besides that no <UNK> to the man but he's never been the actor with the greatest range despite being lots of fun the movie isn't great as it gets a little bit too silly at times and there's a whole sub plot with a robot that i didn't like but overall the man with the screaming brain is a film that we sadly don't see too much of nowadays the film is an all out no holds <UNK> b movie and it deserves respect for that if nothing else
<START> i wasn't expecting much from this film but was eager to try something which i initially thought would primarily be an early 80s teen horror although three teens are somewhat critical plot it is by no means a teen horror film br br 'the <UNK> is about a little aztec idol that <UNK> many hands as its <UNK> who must be adult and thus becomes the <UNK> for <UNK> all of the <UNK> evil and often with deadly <UNK> for not only the victims of the <UNK> but of the <UNK> himself after making several <UNK> in <UNK> over control of this thing three teenagers wind up finding it and can't figure out what it is except that since they found it strange and dangerous things are <UNK> they offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual <UNK> although it is her producer who wants to investigate further especially if it means he can get control of the idol i presume the teens are even not yet <UNK> enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol it is a story told a thousand times particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare br br this one was at least for me able to sustain some interest though low budget it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the low budget come and go horror fare of the earlier decades had nowadays they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets we are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth despite a story of clichés and though not terribly gory the special effects were done nicely br br again it is routine horror tale especially with the ending which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly <UNK> but one that is not so embarrassingly bad it might be worth checking out even if just for laughs
<START> living in romania i was almost stunned by the very realistic setting for the scenes and the great care paid to local details by the director the performance of anthony queen is absolutely great and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting him the movie does take a little knowledge of the east european context in order to be fully enjoyed but it remains otherwise a great performance with some memorable lines the ending is maybe a bit too melodramatic but that's actually the way people are in this part of the world i believe the screenplay is great because it presents the horrors of the 2nd <UNK> in a most original manner no blood no <UNK> still lives are <UNK> and the smiles you get every now and then throughout the movie are quickly killed by the war realities touching the characters
<START> i'm a big fan of patricia <UNK> and <UNK> so i watched this show when it came on a e some years ago the show was strange to say the least but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses this has got to be one of the worst shows i've ever seen i wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid the <UNK> pun intended comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and sci fi movies if this version is true to the book then i won't be checking the book out from my local library the american version came out some years after i'd seen this original to my surprise the americans got it right this time as their version with meryl streep and <UNK> is played for laughs and is rather funny when played for laughs the storyline works
<START> i watched this movie the night it premiered on mtv usually to me mtv movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good summer phoenix is an amazing actress and i thought that nick <UNK> was good too if mtv started showing more movies like this i would probably enjoy the channel a lot more
<START> this is just the same old crap that is <UNK> from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie gee maybe that's why it is a straight to video wanna be movie br br i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it one of the worst decisions i have ever made what a waste i usually like b movies some of them are actually quite good but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny br br the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film these so called movie makers have absolutely no talent br br stupid plot horrible acting especially the drag queens what <UNK> would actually find that sexy lame writing if there even was a script seems like the kinda bull someone just made up on the spot br br what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well done at all br br how much attention to detail would it take to <UNK> that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally and it is <UNK> that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results br br anyway avoid this stink bomb at all costs
<START> one true thing is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired greatly greatly inspired performances i am not necessarily stating that the film is uplifting because it isn't in fact the movie is down right depressing i am trying to say that it takes a lot for a movie to generate emotional tears from an attending crowd br br i cried in one true thing enough to conclude that this is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of 1998 the characters were perfectly casted the performances are all guaranteed oscar <UNK> especially meryl streep who <UNK> the dying kate extremely well her acting alone was enough to make the movie <UNK> to the point of recommendation and gives you a new point of view at her i also thought that <UNK> <UNK> portrayed a realistic single free <UNK> woman who has to take care of their own mother the other cast members including william hurt tom everett scott were also superb the script of this movie was really fantastic it is kind of funny how the movie's concept has to do with the controversial happenings in my local area you see i live near <UNK> <UNK> and right now a big issue here is assistant suicide doctor jack excuse my miss spelling if so ways have just been <UNK> the public will vote on this according to their beliefs in november after watching one true thing it really changed my perspective at this topic although i have always believed in it without revealing the ending of the film i will simply say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and i think it fits in accurately with the gorgeous story overall this movie does indeed have more emotional impact than titanic saving private ryan or any other <UNK> released in the last few years i think that is because the main idea of this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day so it relates better to an audience and indeed that this could happening to you
<START> i really appreciate what <UNK> won had done before his death everything i want to say that his choice for love is <UNK> if he chose da <UNK> that will be good for him but da <UNK> will need more time to recover from his death obviously he does not want to let it happen as he did in the film he chose giving up so it was just temporary agony for da <UNK> br br as comparison my life without me is very different their behavior shows big difference between eastern culture and western culture i cannot say which is better every one can has right to choose that is totally up to you life is equal for everybody we can live only once any choice is acceptable if only you think it is fit for you br br in truth the slow pace of the film cannot be the excuse for <UNK> the movie just calm down you will get more from the movie br br one of the best korean movies i ever watched 9 10
<START> this swedish splatter movie tries to parody imitate american horror films such as the evil dead <UNK> and others writer director actor cinematographer <UNK> and writer producer actor makeup effects <UNK> did i miss something were obviously inspired by sam <UNK> but the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in the evil dead and elsewhere some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this film but i didn't br br the film rather disturbed than entertained me it tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product just left me with a feeling of <UNK> although it wasn't scary or shocking at all the combination of different genre elements made this film very strange i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny br br the story is quite inventive except for the showdown at the hospital but i didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above the gore make up effects are considerably good and at least the loose limbs sequences were quite entertaining because in these scenes the film makers didn't try to mix scares and jokes br br all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love rest in pieces evil ed br br my rating 3 10 made me stick to american productions
<START> this film played in <UNK> <UNK> for 7 days i saw it on the last day of its run <UNK> that i could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience the <UNK> shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded <UNK> is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters <UNK> on deck almost a ballet and <UNK> in its <UNK> than so many more explicit films these days i just cringe to think that more people won't have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater the dvd experience will not be the same here's an idea if you live in a college town see if you can <UNK> for it to show up in a campus film festival
<START> and unfortunately so did i any movie that relies on a bad pun as its <UNK> or its title should be <UNK> to the 2 00 bin but we decided to try a second <UNK> bad movie for movie night we had a winner in house of the dead go with that one if you want a laughable flick br br some witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by mr <UNK> some guy took a dump in the woods and that same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one i don't remember much else the last third of the movie was utterly insipid and we were all waiting in agony until the end
<START> there have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope but the war at home is worth seeing portraying vietnam vet jeremy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> having trouble connecting with his texas family much of the movie is very likely to tense you up but nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealed br br part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both texas and of the generation gap <UNK> parents bob martin sheen and kathy bates clearly have a problem with their son's attitude both about the war and his <UNK> of <UNK> his sister karen <UNK> williams is uncertain with whom to side but after the dinner there can be no <UNK> br br so we as americans may never be able to fully get over the vietnam war but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people <UNK> <UNK> certainly did a good job directing also starring <UNK> <UNK> and carla
<START> formula movie about the <UNK> son of a rich who stands to <UNK> a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like a tv movie not really exciting the only reason i bothered to see it was because <UNK> vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking landscapes on display but malcolm <UNK> part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie michael <UNK> plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare
<START> <UNK> 1985 was a cannon <UNK> film directed by tobe hooper it's a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to earth during the latest space <UNK> mission steve <UNK> stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy but really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of <UNK> may she's one smoking hot number the director was a huge fan of female vampire a k a miss may <UNK> <UNK> title role the film is beautifully photographed and directed there's plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happy br br i have to give this film a very high rating tobe hooper was the man he made three interesting films for cannon during this time period texas chainsaw massacre ii and <UNK> from mars as well if you like science fiction horror films tobe hooper films or <UNK> may this film's just up your alley br br highest recommendation br br did i mention <UNK> may is smoking hot
<START> some sort of <UNK> must be given to <UNK> it's actually out full full moon it bears all the marks of say your demonic <UNK> or puppet series without their dopey uh charm full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly these <UNK> things man do they ever take themselves seriously this increasingly stupid franchise though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it once made up for its low budgets by being stylish now it's just ish
<START> at last a film to rival <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in terms of sheer and utter <UNK> this is actually the first film i've ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb and with good reason br br for one the cast is nothing special that's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l <UNK> <UNK> secondly the production values a <UNK> television sci fi such as <UNK> has more convincing sets and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the <UNK> teams are filmed on dry sets with that aren't very convincing this film is literally the worst part though is that this film is boring for the first 45 minutes i felt as if we were going round and round in circles it's a <UNK> shark <UNK> t no really <UNK> t i'm not making this up <UNK> t there it is now i didn't see anything let me guess <UNK> <UNK> t after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so then we're back to the dialog run around dialog is not a bad thing but that's all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isn't very good at it the dialog is often contrived and clichéd and is not very interesting to listen to i don't see any point <UNK> the special effects this film has worse qualities br br the sets are small and unrealistic the acting is sub par the script oh lord the script is worse than a garbage of sci fi television has to <UNK> up it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was br br yet another awful awful addition to the there's about four series of films bring on steve please
<START> golden boy is <UNK> humor <UNK> on <UNK> in the <UNK> of educational moments the main character <UNK> wanders around getting himself into the <UNK> situations involving women it's just that he's shy on the surface but <UNK> everything until he can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time
<START> wow at first i thought who writes these things how hard is that choice between a man who offers you and your children wealth <UNK> and security as opposed to a husband who offers you only <UNK> abuse <UNK> and poverty however our choices are not always as clear cut cut as one would think indeed the wealthy gentleman was all a woman could <UNK> to and yet the pull of her husband her sexual desire for him was almost overwhelming what to do what to do as a viewer you became as confused and <UNK> as she was anyway what i really came on this site to <UNK> about was my admiration of the voice of the i thought although it is actually the voice of an irish singer in the film looking him up i find he is <UNK> whom i had never heard of before that day what a find i am so grateful wow what a voice what a day thank you <UNK>
<START> with the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film i don't think that shakespeare is in any great danger this is the story of an ancient aztec mummy who has been <UNK> his stuff has been taken and this really <UNK> him off he seems to know who's doing this even though he's a <UNK> raving <UNK> i loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature there are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard full of cheap crosses and other junk there's a <UNK> where the mummy is kept i can't begin to <UNK> the idiocy of this including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown there is a door next to it so he can crawl out to the robot a mass of metal <UNK> with a guy inside the dialogue is awful there are long pauses between speeches as if someone <UNK> is feeding them their lines i love the scene where the two little kids <UNK> their mother of going out at night she goes into this zombie state or something nonetheless if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously watch this have a couple beers first like a direct line from the <UNK> tomb watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink what more can i say
<START> some films are so badly made they are watchable purely for the cringe factor <UNK> made me cringe so much it was uncomfortable i watched it all <UNK> what i was watching wasn't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming mix the most <UNK> performances from the most wooden actors an abysmal script were every comment from all of the <UNK> sounded like it came from the same character and the most <UNK> editing that tried and failed <UNK> to give the film a forced pace all these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return avoid at every cost
<START> this movie is not at all like city of god you might get the same feeling but it isn't there's no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes you get the idea if you ask me i think this film was a waste of time there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than wooden camera yes i might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion it's one of those films where i can get the feeling that i'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and i all gave mutual looks and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was so to conclude this matter i advise not to watch it br br personal note making <UNK> talk english was a big mistake in city of god they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality
<START> complete entertainment although there are many strange things in the movie that the fairy tale itself doesn't have them including the <UNK> characters mother and daughter the general concept rocks
<START> being a fan of the series i thought how bad can the movie be well i got my answer some movies should never be made why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters the pete character in the series wasn't a <UNK> little baby as portrayed in the movie the only good thing in this movie besides the music and that <UNK> danes is pretty was that it was short what's with that dance scene the only reason i didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny maybe that was the plan it's really bad when a cheap 60's tv show is better then a 90's 20 million dollar film el <UNK> cost only and is a much better film don't even waste your money when it comes out on tape it's not even worth renting
<START> <UNK> <UNK> mega epic stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great arthur can be slow and static in the early <UNK> manner but this classic <UNK> train journey across america to the <UNK> is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen on t v the lack of close ups and distant sound <UNK> may prove <UNK> young john wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can't command amazingly the film <UNK> and wayne spent most of the following decade in grade b western fodder
<START> it should be noted that this movie was not improvised as you're probably thinking of it despite what the title at the end suggests the movie was heavily scripted and <UNK> cassavetes didn't have enough money to support the inevitably high production costs of an <UNK> sort of movie even if he had wanted to produce such a thing the <UNK> of the movie is contained in the actors' performances and the emotions that they draw out of the lines br br that said allow me to say that this is a stunning work that i'm sure i'll come back to again and again the depths of emotion that cassavetes is able to draw out of the smallest gestures and interactions is incredible i have no idea how he was able to direct such amazing performances out of the actors especially under the conditions he worked this is truly a magnificent landmark of film that i would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the hollywood mold
<START> this movie was so bad if anyone out their who starred in the movie are reading this including the director i hate you lol that blonde woman who was running away screaming through the forest at least cry rather than scream and keep doing the dodgy heavy breathing and oh dear god if it was the director who <UNK> out the cameras on this one then go back to a normal job no one wants to be watching some scared woman's <UNK> throughout it damn don't even think about renting buying or even having a copy of this within 100 <UNK> of your house since it can be <UNK> to people who like good movies when i got home i thought id rented a movie by the acting and style of the camera
<START> negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been <UNK> dozens of times everyone in this movie should attend anonymous you would think an original story could <UNK> from the general concept young men at a <UNK> school are <UNK> to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing it does raise interesting questions but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke the typical characters were present including the <UNK> jock and nerd glasses included i could not have been more <UNK> in the wooden dialog and cliché characters upon the <UNK> of the movie i had to throw the dvd in the trash stay far away from this dud you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back
<START> in the history of cinema every great film maker had to create a first film many times when viewed after they have become a success a light <UNK> goes on in our heads the connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started so it is with horses on mars it is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straight forward narrative that tells a great story but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time in the imagery i found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film br br a young film maker always has <UNK> to be made but if mr anderson continues on this path i think we will someday look back on this film as the beginning a great career br br you should definitely view this film nothing beats the <UNK> of the big screen
<START> truly a wonderful movie bruce willis gives his always outstanding comedic romantic acting power to this message movie and the movie brings hope to the losers many of us know we are a gift to everyone of middle age whose spent time seems both full and yet empty there is more around the next bend and it can be great <UNK> and romantic leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past and then take off on a favorite flight to your better future if we could re live our youthful experiences if we could really remember the events that shaped us wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom see the movie open the gift
<START> i had high hopes for this production being one of my favourite works br br indeed a lot of it is reasonable helen is not a bad lady <UNK> but lacks the <UNK> which the original character is <UNK> with many of the minor characters do well and the scottish settings are superb br br the big disappointment to me is jason connery in the title role he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses surely for the first time as well he can do so much better any production when compared to the sublime ian <UNK> <UNK> 1979 who to my mind gave the gold standard performance is going to struggle to be appreciated but i actually fell asleep and had to <UNK> this one before i could get through it hardly a great sign br br honestly one to avoid
<START> i am so disappointed in this movie i can't express it i was so excited when i started watching this film to see mickey rourke all leather faced and that kid from third rock from the sun acting like i psycho i thought wow this is going to be a winner <UNK> natural born killers style and it got better the production value was great the directing was great the acting was great the cinematography was great and the plot was well the plot well what what plot about half way through this film i was pulling my hair out yelling what the hell is going on and i mean that quite literally nothing makes any sense whatsoever nothing nothing nothing
<START> this really is a great film full of love and humor it <UNK> the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey michael managed to <UNK> a great cast of top players a minor miracle for a first film no doubt they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story david carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty natasha is unpredictable <UNK> and yet totally lovable as grace also a great turn by karen black great to see her on the screen again as <UNK> crazed but sympathetic mother there is cutting wit throughout allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with life's pain the acting is impeccable the editing tight the direction inspired and the music creates a fitting backdrop of mood given the present day hollywood blockbuster <UNK> full of big budgets big names car crashes and special effects <UNK> <UNK> is a refreshing departure give yourself a treat and see this movie
<START> is a b movie at best and at worst is more of a disaster that what it's supposed to be depicting to be fair you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept asks you to suspend disbelief in science human interaction and common sense br br tommy lee jones gets to be the <UNK> yet 1990s sensitive head <UNK> of the office of <UNK> management and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides however anne <UNK> gives a <UNK> bad performance as a smart ass <UNK> who becomes love interest while the city is burning down <UNK> <UNK> hoffman goes from field of dreams and american president to a turn as a <UNK> <UNK> and victim for life daughter of jones don cheadle gets to sit in a really office and take <UNK> phone calls doing the job that in reality would and should be doing br br anyway the movie really starts going downhill when <UNK> partner gets sucked into a <UNK> <UNK> while they're breaking into the subway lines it picks up speed when jones starts suggesting that they use <UNK> to <UNK> the flow of the <UNK> flowing down the street <UNK> who loves to lecture everyone about the science of <UNK> being apparently oblivious to the fact that <UNK> is hot and it <UNK> metal and rock and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect it really starts to suck when the film introduces rodney king like racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can't understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing <UNK> but hey in the end the three of them will be working together to build a k <UNK> <UNK> to stop the <UNK> from eating up his neighborhood even though the <UNK> is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldn't stop <UNK> anyway besides k <UNK> are hardly <UNK> but i guess <UNK> wouldn't think to poke its head through the gaps not when tommy lee jones is glaring at it don't even get me started on the stranded subway car subplot where a of hot <UNK> is coming down but oddly enough it's not too hot to attempt a rescue it's not too <UNK> to see and there aren't any <UNK> <UNK> so everyone can breathe this must be la <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> you know it eats cars but is <UNK> friendly br br there are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy for instance the two security guards <UNK> up <UNK> paintings have a completely meaningless and <UNK> conversation about weight and at the end no sooner does the little boy jones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash than a <UNK> breaks out and <UNK> everyone up and then the sun comes out and <UNK> says something along the lines of <UNK> <UNK> br br almost achieves battlefield earth status but except for <UNK> no one approaches travolta like badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well if you are from the la area as i am it's kind of funny to think of a <UNK> flow <UNK> out <UNK> i gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this
<START> i bought this film from my local blockbuster for <UNK> an it's been sitting in my video <UNK> for at least a year now then tonight i decided to see it the film was quite different to what i had expected and i didn't find any humour in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual <UNK> and i didn't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film i felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job i was following her emotions and what happened around her some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but i could really put myself in her place loving someone but them <UNK> you at every turn no matter how hard you try i thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different <UNK> well i was expecting something like bound <UNK> a love story but this is a very different film not for <UNK>
<START> to sum this story up in a few sentences a teenage girl amy uses her hot body and supposed virginity to <UNK> a young troubled guy matt with a potential football <UNK> to provide her a full ride out of town come to find out she has quite the reputation has slept with many football players in the past hoping they would offer her the same deal both of these kids have come from troubled dysfunctional homes <UNK> mothers a alcoholic who repeatedly <UNK> him in front of his friends <UNK> mother had a bad reputation herself got pregnant with amy at a a young age matt falls in love with amy tries to <UNK> out his life for her very predictable ending the actress that plays amy is actually 33 years old trying to play a teenager
<START> might end up being the biggest disappointment that i will see in 2009 i seem to be the rare person who disliked <UNK> <UNK> but i think that his lady vengeance and sympathy for mr vengeance are among the best films i've seen in the <UNK> decade therefore i really was looking forward to see this especially as it got such positive reviews instead i found the film clichéd and broke little if any new ground to the vampire genre and while i can appreciate a bit of <UNK> humor in movies like this i felt park did this at very <UNK> times br br others have compared <UNK> this to let the right one in and i have to say that let the right one in was far superior to this one and was a fresh take on the vampire genre sadly <UNK> take was a tired one
<START> this is unfortunately <UNK> last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over 30 years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking this recording is also a bit different from most of his other <UNK> that it is a bit than most of his other <UNK> br br throughout his long prolific and influential career <UNK> has moved from the more <UNK> humor and fart jokes towards a more viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and <UNK> <UNK> throughout the years and <UNK> in this performance though i would argue that his audio book when will jesus bring the <UNK> chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language <UNK> and the breakdown of our values it's bad for ya is quite <UNK> of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer br br if you are offended by foul language or the <UNK> of the church you will probably not like any of <UNK> stand up material however if you enjoy being mentally <UNK> and can tolerate the language and <UNK> you would probably greatly enjoy this concert
<START> intended as light entertainment this film is indeed successful as such during its first half but then <UNK> to a rapidly <UNK> script that drops it down harry judd nelson a <UNK> <UNK> and daphne gina <UNK> an aspiring actress are employed as live window <UNK> at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within <UNK> they witness from their less than protective glass observation point an apparent homicide occurring on the street the <UNK> murderer miles raymond nick <UNK> a local <UNK> returns the following day to observe the <UNK> since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior <UNK> violent event and when one of the posing pair <UNK> the fun begins daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry's criminal background he becomes cynical there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed and this one manages to <UNK> most of them including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion a low budget affair shot in <UNK> even police <UNK> aspects are displayed by <UNK> the always capable <UNK> tries to make something of her role but <UNK> is incredibly <UNK> <UNK> so as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose <UNK> although the film <UNK> into nonsense cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> prefers to not follow suit as he sets up with camera and lighting some <UNK> realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue a well crafted score appropriately based upon the action is contributed by hal <UNK> the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a <UNK> manner by nelson and <UNK> but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic predictability takes over the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view and post production flaws set the work back <UNK> than should be expected for a basic thriller
<START> i've read approximately 10 reviews of this film but haven't taken any of them to heart harrison ford is being criticized for everything from his <UNK> to his <UNK> and i really don't see what any of these things have to do with the film as i recall he had bad hair plus bad reviews in blade runner but it's still a favorite among us it is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the it has received br br i would gladly pay 7 50 just to watch a bald harrison ford <UNK> his lawn
<START> this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie it was on the usa channel gilbert up all night i will never forget at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues some sexual you know 12 is a very rough and weird age it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl and being a young lady this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me i now have a daughter that is 12 have been searching for a couple years for this movie if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age
<START> <UNK> vs deep blue is no doubt a fascinating story but i don't think you'd know it by watching this movie i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that <UNK> cheated and what does this theory <UNK> upon the idea that at one point the computer made a move that looked human i am not a chess <UNK> or a computer scientist and while i don't doubt that the move looked human to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess playing computer ever created could make a surprising move or that such a machine could beat even a genius like <UNK> the movie gets way too much <UNK> out of this theory and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved that could have made it a much more interesting story the direction also relies way too much on the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> narration and the imagery of an 18th century chess playing machine that looks like one of those <UNK> gypsy you see at the carnival also the story was <UNK> down by many empty shots of <UNK> <UNK> the scene of the crime i don't doubt that <UNK> and the chess community found behavior <UNK> but i don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation at the end of the movie you are left with the feeling that <UNK> is a huge <UNK> and the deep blue <UNK> are either victims or <UNK> i think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory which he almost certainly did he should have presented a lot more evidence in fact more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place the whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth
<START> the folks at <UNK> have done a cool cute and wild adaptation of their short films of wallace and <UNK> to feature length as the man and his dog <UNK> who seem to have more of the intelligence or <UNK> for the latter in this case they've invented a machine that can capture all of the <UNK> that are eating up the <UNK> all over a quiet english village in particular for mrs or for those who are much to the <UNK> of victor <UNK> who just wants to kill all the <UNK> with his trust rifle wallace and <UNK> seem to have success with their machine but wallace has a mix up a machine he's made to make more food suddenly <UNK> crosses himself with a rabbit the curse is on br br a lot of this is about as much light hearted fun that a kid's movie could ask for but it also <UNK> its hat to the oldest tradition in classic cartoon slapstick looney tunes which in turn is <UNK> to much silent comedy and vaudeville granted the <UNK> guys nick park and steve box have a bunch more gimmicks and tricks and <UNK> with their material it's never less than amazing to see how they put the stop motion to use even when a joke or a gag might be a little on the funny ho ho not funny ha ha side a tired criticism but i'll say it curse of the were rabbit works so well on all <UNK> for the audience in its <UNK> story and sudden <UNK> into exposition the golden bullet story is a <UNK> park and box and company never lose sight of glee in the material br br it's fuzzy and warm hearted and completely off the wall for the kids even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange <UNK> such as the truck wallace and <UNK> drive around in and for adults there's little <UNK> of funky <UNK> tones in the midst of a classic english farce only and i'm probably a minority opinion here when compared to chicken run it's almost a little slight a work there's less any plot than there is a series of running gags and of course lots of <UNK> involving <UNK> and monsters and <UNK> and cheese and horrible men with <UNK> in their guns like the <UNK> voiced <UNK> but when it strikes best it's one of the most entertaining films of 2005 it gives me a big goofy smile anytime it's on tv
<START> i saw this film some years ago and promptly bought the soundtrack because it was simply excellent music is endearing and should be given the recognition it richly deserves the cinematography is awesome critics hated it but they hated home alone too i haven't found it on video but welcome anyone who can find a copy
<START> i didn't really care for this had they gotten rid of the comedy slapstick and focused on the dramatic philosophical aspects of the script this might have been worthwhile br br the more the film went on the less i liked the protagonist <UNK> he does have interesting things to say but he's also a <UNK> insecure jerk br br 3 10
<START> i saw this performance on tv and taped it my daughter played it over and over again i <UNK> out at work and everyone just loved it it is just brilliant physical comedy bill made an appearance here in california he was working and living in new york and performed the regard of flight on stage i was able to take my daughter and her girlfriend to see this brilliant performance br br bill was awarded a federal <UNK> and my daughter wrote him a letter of <UNK> and bill was so kind to write her a note back and a photograph br br people ask me and i can't decide if he is a comedian and actor or a clown actually he is all three i really wish this was on dvd my tape is lost
<START> i watched this series on <UNK> back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so very atmospheric and creepy sometimes this is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted you are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people the villains are almost laughably evil especially the sheriff of <UNK> man i would love to beat the s t out of that <UNK> little bastard nicholas grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the sheriff his <UNK> boy sir guy is equally but is also pathetic lots of murder and mayhem in this series along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that nature i noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising if i had kids i would not let them watch this outstanding use of locations in this show also it is now on dvd so go out and buy it
<START> and again columbia pictures decides to merely make <UNK> using the original version with curly and without any of the gags or jokes to boot toward the end of this pitiful flick when joe gets stuck riding the bull the studio didn't even make much of an effort to re record the sound for if you listen carefully you can still here curly going woo woo woo woo also when moe and larry throw the <UNK> in order to slow the bull down so he can get off that's lifted right from the original because you can actually see moe and larry magically appear 15 years younger why oh why did moe allow all this to happen it's a burning question that probably can never be answered because as far as i know in real life he was quite sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather high standards for his work as also did larry curly and <UNK> don't waste your time on this one
<START> how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me the test that <UNK> workers take is so difficult there is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie how they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling i didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid then he tries to start the car without his keys lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all it's just a sad stupid mess i liked the <UNK> dress though br br send it back to <UNK> as soon as possible
<START> yes non can't see what's the big deal about this film some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly <UNK> are the ones who would actually <UNK> it but i <UNK> with you <UNK> look at the other crap that's been <UNK> out from <UNK> and compare it to this film it's like comparing a <UNK> to a little diamond this film is the first to truly show some the seedy <UNK> something the forces that be pretend does not exist and there's a part in the film where a gangster ah <UNK> in our unique <UNK> <UNK> in 4 languages namely <UNK> english <UNK> and well the truth is most of us can and do do that all the time the sad thing is that viewers from foreign will have an easier time getting their <UNK> little <UNK> on this gem in its country of origin it was banned initially only to be given and r rating and that too with about 20 cuts to it it's nice to know you that one of the best creative edgy and original films ever created would be easier for you to obtain <UNK> <UNK> halfway across the world than in your own nation
<START> like another poster mentioned <UNK> <UNK> a local boston tv station showed this multiple times over the years on saturday <UNK> they paired it with the first sequel return of the <UNK> br br now i haven't seen it since then but it never left me aside from the atrocious dubbing and faded color this was a pretty good fantasy technically it isn't horror until the statue comes to life at the end it's just about a village ruled over by an evil man there's a giant stone statue there that the villagers keep praying to to help them to no <UNK> but things go too far the <UNK> comes to life and destroys the bad guys but then it starts going after the good guys too well done with some cool special effects at the end loved how he got rid of the main bad guy also there was an enchanted forest worked in which was kind of interesting too br br no masterpiece but an unusual <UNK> fantasy horror film worth catching but not if it's the dubbed print
<START> here we've got an intelligent mixture of typical and intelligent filmmaking not that the script has not its big holes and a few are a bit but the cinematography is a <UNK> treat and the soundtrack is first rate the blend of fast and colorful slow sometimes nearly poetic parts has no comparison in its kind of movie so a <UNK> is rather hard the closest genre is a disaster or with deeper human and political notes than usual well worth to be seen worldwide in cinemas but i am hoping this for so many other mostly asian movies before and nobody seems to believe me unfortunately
<START> i would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls the offbeat <UNK> griffith jeff daniels comedy something wild in which a rather eccentric free spirit <UNK> up with a conservative and very <UNK> young man and the two pose as a couple and basically her personality gradually has an effect on him he <UNK> up and learns to enjoy their short lived <UNK> that is exactly what happens here except insert convenient store robbing eccentric alex <UNK> arquette in <UNK> <UNK> role and super <UNK> teen lincoln the name is no coincidence played by <UNK> in jeff <UNK> part this movie even shares the same twist and abrupt genre change where the creepy violent boyfriend suddenly shows up in the end and things end up quite badly only here instead of it being ray liotta playing a <UNK> to 1950s film <UNK> it's peter greene br br the story is about a teenage kid who is in his own little world he has some sort of fascination with death following his brother's suicide and his parents have <UNK> too behaving quite strangely the mother is convinced christmas will be arriving shortly despite it being august then on a night out with the guys one of whom is played by jason of the wonder years trying to buy them beer he runs into alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car with his <UNK> of course and they take off for mini adventure across the <UNK> of the west coast robbing convenient stores in robin hood sort of fashion and of course <UNK> in the routine self discovery as each asks more about the other's life but alex has left behind a partner in her trade of <UNK> and he isn't going away easily although we're not consistently reminded of him or anything as in repetitive flashback or cutting over to his point of view at least this much was done cleverly br br <UNK> me a aka <UNK> <UNK> is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal <UNK> and self discovery that <UNK> quite a bit for the first half of the film but delivers the goods a little to late once alex and lincoln arrive at her home out in the middle of nowhere by the time the filmmakers give you enough <UNK> the film is unfortunately almost over i would recommend that if this is the sort of story you're in the mood for and despite <UNK> arquette always giving a good performance even in a poorly written film i would still recommend catching this in its best form something wild
<START> i did not think <UNK> was the funniest movie of all time i like and <UNK> la <UNK> a lot more i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes <UNK> la <UNK> or jack ass should see it i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out i think that <UNK> <UNK> should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from <UNK> and probably could have made this movie <UNK> more funnier i think ryan <UNK> was probably the best actor and it should have had <UNK> <UNK> more
<START> first of all i've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks how bad was chris as <UNK> on the sopranos chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief and then throw in bobby as one of his vegas <UNK> it's just too much to take in a dramatic movie neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tony paulie or uncle junior and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster i want that person to be my make up person over the next 25 years so i'll never age a day either so that's all i'll write on this movie since it's not worth wasting too much more of my time br br yes i do know that michael <UNK> and steve are their real names
<START> you are alone is a beautiful almost delicate film smart directed <UNK> written with two complex and riveting performances and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you br br the story about a <UNK> girl who <UNK> her depression and <UNK> by working a few hours a week as a 500 an hour <UNK> <UNK> and the depressed next door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown new <UNK> hotel features breathtaking performances from both jessica as the girl and richard <UNK> as her neighbor br br as daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with maggie <UNK> in secretary she so captures a <UNK> angst of growing into her own skin and when she talks about always being in control you start to realize she's not in control at all but in danger of going over the deep end which i guess in a way she does br br <UNK> as buddy is depressed angry <UNK> a shell of a man but it isn't until the film's startling conclusion that you grasp a full <UNK> of his pain br br after a very brief opening segment which will hook most independent film lovers and have the religious right running towards the <UNK> we are brought into the hotel room at first you're not sure about these people or the film making style shaky annoying like the characters until you realize their back story told in short flashbacks they're <UNK> at first for a reason and so is the camera but as they open up as the story <UNK> down likewise so does the camera and i don't know 20 minutes in give or take you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screen br br having just seen the world premiere screening at the brooklyn film fest where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes  i almost wish the film were already on video so i could watch it again because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film particularly a very <UNK> dialog regarding fantasy and climax i really thought things were going in a very different direction but i realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what i imagined i need to see it again but as dark and sexual as much of the talk is blunt to say the least i found myself laughing more than i might have expected at some of its <UNK> which definitely falls into the things we think but lack the nerve to say out loud category it's very blunt especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning some of it will make you uncomfortable especially if you're watching you are alone with a partner you'll definitely have something to talk about  perhaps argue about  afterwards perhaps it should come with a warning you should be alone when watching the music is amazing i would have come home and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if i could have the film looks as good as anything shot on film after the screening director was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good his answer none they couldn't afford it br br i have to give credit i am a big fan of his two shorts the pretty girl and objects in the mirror but even they could not have prepared me for the <UNK> and surprises of this film br br to everyone involved bravo
<START> tony <UNK> pro <UNK> isn't much different at all from the previous games <UNK> tony <UNK> 3 the only thing new that is featured in tony <UNK> pro <UNK> is the new selection of levels and <UNK> out graphics tony <UNK> pro <UNK> offers a new career mode and that is the career the career is basically tony <UNK> 1 career because there is only about five challenges per level if you missed tony <UNK> 1 and 2 i suggest that you buy tony <UNK> pro <UNK> but if you have played the first two games you should still try this one overall there really isn't anything new but it is still very fun to go through the game hopefully this review benefits your needs br br graphics 7 out of 10 overall the clean visuals isn't really one of tony <UNK> pro <UNK> main characteristics the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony <UNK> 1 and 2 and the character models look a little bit improved when you look back to tony <UNK> pro <UNK> 1 and 2 on the old <UNK> the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head in tony <UNK> pro <UNK> the graphics are rendered a lot better the character models are no longer filled with the <UNK> are more smooth but not to the <UNK> extent tony <UNK> pro <UNK> visuals do not compare to tony <UNK> <UNK> graphics but <UNK> probably didn't want to make tony <UNK> pro <UNK> have extraordinary graphics overall the graphics deserve an average score of 7 because they did not put the full power of the <UNK> to use in here graphics are nice and clean that's all i have to say br br sound 8 out of 10 the sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination but the <UNK> popping off of the ground sound great the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating was because you are not <UNK> to listen to the below average tony <UNK> soundtrack because there is a <UNK> soundtrack feature the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony <UNK> 1 and 2 mainly because it is more <UNK> and just the fact that everything sounds great one of the main reasons why i bought this game is because of the <UNK> soundtrack the <UNK> sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did just a little <UNK> out one of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is over it will not proceed to the next track the song that you have just listened to will just play over again i don't like the in game soundtrack but like i said you are not <UNK> to listen to it br br controls 10 out of 10 the controls are the best part of tony <UNK> pro <UNK> the control set up is <UNK> comfortable and easy to get used to back in the <UNK> days people thought that the controls were the best ever but it looks like has done a better job with the <UNK> control surprisingly it is very easy to use the control stick to <UNK> tricks <UNK> has done great work with tony <UNK> pro <UNK> controls they have made the <UNK> <UNK> the best for tony <UNK> games you will not be disappointed with the control style and that is a guarantee br br game play 10 out of 10 <UNK> the fact that tony <UNK> pro <UNK> is basically tony <UNK> 1 and 2 put together the game play is still unbelievably fun the game play factor has been changed around a bit this time you get a lot more air than in the first two games and it is a lot easier to perform tricks in tony <UNK> pro <UNK> each character has three career <UNK> <UNK> of tony <UNK> 1 career tony <UNK> 2 career and the career tony <UNK> 1 career is rather easy because in the first game you get nothing for air the tony <UNK> 2 career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the <UNK> version did the only amount of difficulty that applies to the career is finding out where all items are but after you've done that career is no hard at all in the career there is a total of 3 levels and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes collecting s k a t e and doing whatever else is required for that particular level the third level out of the three is the competition level where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold in the first two levels the secret tapes and collecting the letters s k a t e are featured in both of them overall tony <UNK> pro <UNK> still maintains the old tony <UNK> pro <UNK> vibe br br story br br fun factor 10 out of 10 tony <UNK> pro <UNK> is by far the most <UNK> game on <UNK> today i have played tony <UNK> pro <UNK> 1 and 2 and back then i didn't like them but for some reason tony <UNK> pro <UNK> is really fun there really isn't much to say except that tony <UNK> pro <UNK> is by far the best game on <UNK> today one problem is that if you've already gone through the game once you will play it a couple more times but it will be repetitive br br replay value 10 out of 10 tony <UNK> pro <UNK> delivers a high amount of replay value there is a lot of <UNK> to <UNK> and a lot of character videos overall tony <UNK> pro <UNK> has lots of replay value mainly because it is so fun br br best feature you are not <UNK> to listen to the crappy in game soundtrack worst feature the <UNK> soundtrack is a bit messed up br br final statement lots of people have complained in the past that they didn't like tony <UNK> pro <UNK> because there is nothing new but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for 50 00 br br graphics 7 out of 10 sound 8 out of 10 control 10 out

<START> oh my gosh this was one of the best sci fi movies i have ever seen and quite frankly i can't stand sci fi films br br <UNK> <UNK> and his co workers made this movie really enjoyable br br i also must say that <UNK> <UNK> is by far the most <UNK> and most talented male actors i have seen keep it up <UNK> your doing great as for everyone else good job i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued again great job everyone and i <UNK> rooting for you <UNK> br br sincerely yours br br alexandra
<START> think of an extremely low rent version of <UNK> and you've got <UNK> squad that sums up the flick in a nutshell i must give credit where <UNK> due though the film has a nice visual appeal to it i liked the cinematography i liked the wild color schemes i liked the costume designs but without good acting a film has no redeeming value i'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal with good actors and sharp dialogue i e the brothers or any edward burns film the actors either <UNK> their dialogue in or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera this is why i don't <UNK> most mainstream actors let's face it most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason if they're not great actors they're at least competent people <UNK> leo <UNK> but when was the last time you saw a movie where he <UNK> the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page it's a shame because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to <UNK> en scene <UNK> at the same time i can't totally praise steve the director he did write the screenplay which contains some horrible dialogue he might be slightly racist too since there's a black principal in the movie who <UNK> a <UNK> of african american stereotypes
<START> i'm seeing a pattern here if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000 chances are if you go to imdb com there will be <UNK> of lovers of the film yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was <UNK> bad i'm sorry but i read a lot about x m as being some landmark sci fi film that <UNK> realism well if that is the case i could write for several <UNK> about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed gravity might be the first obvious observation or as mst3k did as a skit <UNK> gravity also what about when they are <UNK> to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window um <UNK> the ship being upside down effect that scene i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type just compare this to when worlds <UNK> which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks there's no comparison the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own its not even funny to watch on its own it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of just bad bad bad oh did i mention it's bad
<START> i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun but this movie got <UNK> <UNK> as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2 i gave it an extra star just because david <UNK> gun was cool
<START> the <UNK> describes it exactly this <UNK> of a film was nothing more than the typical <UNK> of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting killing them off 20 years <UNK> crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades the only twist is instead of an angry ex <UNK> or lovable psycho loser it was a nun nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentally <UNK> <UNK> the nun blah blah nun <UNK> the girls people die movie ends the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat <UNK> arms but even they couldn't make this a great movie brian <UNK> should hang his head for <UNK> himself to this refuse i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it or i'd be furious beyond belief if you want a <UNK> flick to please the senses go watch or something stay away from this garbage
<START> like a lot of movies involving little kids this starts off real cute and likable and then after about a half hour or so becomes the reverse br br that's certainly the case here in this time travel story which i usually love where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight great premise and a great lead actor in bruce willis but br br the kid rusty is a smart <UNK> and whiny brat and willis rusty grown up now as russell gets <UNK> with his constant yelling that is entertainment no thanks br br young <UNK> has gone on to become a very good child actor being involved in a number of films including the cat in the hat opposite a more famous child actor <UNK> fanning br br overall a disappointing film especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released
<START> twenty years after watching this i still find myself <UNK> things from this movie like look between the two giant <UNK> or i'll start to sing the <UNK> blue <UNK> theme on the other hand 20 years later i can now make sense of the meat machine as there's still a lot of the stereotypes like this out there that they used for this movie those are signs of a good movie to me i could say this movie stands the test of time which i can't really say for a lot of 80's movies i continue that this movie is still on a list of a lot of people's favorite movie as a kid growing up in the 80's if you like games and have dreams of becoming a game master or find yourself out over these 80's movies to <UNK> your childhood you need to watch this also it's sometimes sarcastic and funny but one <UNK> for certain about this movie if someone ever invites you to a great all <UNK> they don't mean an x or acid trip party they mean get ready for some midnight madness oh you'll see everyone will be dying to play
<START> what exactly is the point of pretending to con people out of things like <UNK> passes and pizza i fail to see a point i'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless br br <UNK> stone doesn't seem to be a very down to earth or even a nice guy he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show br br the worse thing about this piece of crap is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are so not only are they apparently <UNK> the poor people on the other end of the phone but they are also <UNK> the audience who don't have enough time to read the that <UNK> across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show br br not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life what an lie no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched but it's also one of the most <UNK> blatant pieces of bull hit i've ever heard this guy is an br br what makes them think that going to all the trouble of for example write and record a song get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates get dance lessons and actually travel to a <UNK> resort is actually worth only getting free <UNK> passes and some food for free what is the point of that it's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few <UNK> passes and a bit of snow br br as far as comedy goes this is bottom of the barrel stuff
<START> harmony hate him or hate him on this evidence <UNK> might be a better word not him of course just everything he does but it could've been so different because the first ten minutes of this film promises so much including a fantastic idea of a michael jackson <UNK> falling in love with a marilyn monroe <UNK> fantastic and set in paris this could be great but unfortunately may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer the story fails on every level and the audience i witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film making out there apparently the walk out rate at its premiere in last years cannes festival was quite shocking instead of focusing on the two protagonists he switches the story <UNK> to the confines of a <UNK> to introduce a bunch of other <UNK> making the whole experience tedious and <UNK> <UNK> when will the independent cinema stop funding this <UNK>
<START> i have to agree that the movie is not the best i've ever seen but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy <UNK> were the actual <UNK> brothers as actors they were wonderful musicians the movie based on their famous split would have been better had professional actors played the parts many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands most often the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade most of the movie going audience didn't go to see tommy or jimmy <UNK> playing themselves they went for the plot and the music i've never been much of a <UNK> fan but the music is good even today br br i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop <UNK> and that their accents would be considered extreme by a <UNK> audience arthur <UNK> and sara were actually irish actors both born in <UNK> you might remember mr <UNK> as the <UNK> mr in the quiet man and ms as mrs <UNK> in cheaper by the dozen
<START> this was not a good film poorly scripted and acted the concept was not new the effects poor and not a showcase for arnold <UNK> who really is a half decent actor i watched this under some protest and only remembered having seen it before towards the very end it's that forgettable the acting seemed to consist of a number of <UNK> looks devoid of any sincerity i kept expecting this to actually get going and before long i was just hoping it would finish as for the medical bits well i wasn't expecting a true version of er events but this was just comical i am a dr so know what i am taking about and the <UNK> bits were just plain silly br br do not waste your valuable time unless you have absolutely nothing else to do go out ring up a long lost friend watch paint dry sort out your <UNK> draw do some household task avoid at your peril
<START> i say flick because this doesn't deserve the <UNK> movie and certainly not film i regret paying for the rental and although i've never walked out on a movie before this would have been it had i seen it in a theatre a society living underground in the future <UNK> that's original lots of burning barrel drums unexplained <UNK> light shining through windows an <UNK> woman and her shock muted son the list goes on and on c thomas <UNK> affects the <UNK> voice of the stereotypical loner you know like eastwood's been done to death he needs special <UNK> to remember his wife and child yet in the flashbacks he's the same age talk about a poor memory i <UNK> <UNK> when the little boy <UNK> randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens no tension <UNK> religious what religion under overtones saddest of all i expected better from <UNK> <UNK> br br quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life
<START> i suppose it's quite an achievement to be able to present to an audience a true tail about a <UNK> man a tail in which the protagonist will spend the majority of the film on his back in a bed and totally unable to move and yet the achievement is in the film's <UNK> as a dramatic piece as a <UNK> of a true story and i guess as an argument as to why people should have the right to die if they so wish to but the film isn't a political statement and perhaps thankfully it <UNK> away from too many scenes of debate although it does include one for the sake of argument anyway more so this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a <UNK> whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway br br so rather than be an out and out argument the film is more a sweet yet <UNK> dramatic piece about another person wanting something or in search of something the only difference is that by <UNK> this <UNK> it would mean the <UNK> of a someone's life and it would be achieved by not physically going anywhere <UNK> <UNK> plays real life <UNK> an individual who at a much earlier age <UNK> into a <UNK> of water that was too shallow for such activity this rendered him <UNK> for the rest of his life and his wish to die is the focus of <UNK> director <UNK> film we've seen so many films in our lives in which characters have certain or targets one must meet before the film is over to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience but the change of pace in the sea inside is gentle it does not involve young energetic attractive heroes going off to do battle in far off places but a real person after something that means so much to them br br even if you do have a strong policy either pro or anti <UNK> you may find yourself hoping <UNK> gets what he wants at the end of it all anyway the film sets its tone very early on with <UNK> giving a speech on why he wants to die to watching family members immediately introducing the situation and subject to the watching audience who may not know what the film is about interestingly some of the family members are <UNK> what he wishes which might place any audience member that feels strongly about the subject in their respective shoes but the purpose of this set up is to tell the audience <UNK> this isn't one man after something who incidentally has the whole of his family backing him to the <UNK> quite easily the film could've gone down a route in which it is the family vs everybody else but some are anti idea some are too young to acknowledge what's really going on and others are seemingly too <UNK> to even have an opinion other than they just want <UNK> to stick around a bit longer they love him after all br br the sea inside is a following of a story revolving around a victim of sorts <UNK> is a and it is his perspective we see things from this is something that may viewers or have the film come across as quite odd given we are being presented with a film from the point of view of a victim rather than an <UNK> or a lead character in a film that is always inducing the cause in the cause and effect drive but this is no criticism and it's a credit to the director for delivering such an approach in the effective manner in which it is the film asks questions it offers a scenario to its audience if you were in position what would you do or think about or dream of or talk about consequently dreams about lawyer are not so much shot for the audience's pleasure as much as they are an ever so slight window into one man's <UNK> fantasies from his <UNK> br br the study of julia <UNK> somewhat later on when a she begins to share certain similarities with <UNK> and that is when she begins to have <UNK> that are a result of a disease of her own this <UNK> seems <UNK> in the progression of their relationship and adds a further <UNK> of connection on top of an already engaging friendship this is because julia feels the physical pain and <UNK> not in a sense that she isn't able to get up and walk but i think she realises the value of life given how emotionally bad she felt beforehand while the film is based on a true story and covers the subject of <UNK> it feels like more of a down to earth drama about a man in a situation in which he is prepared to fight for what he wants but must do so <UNK> it's refreshing to see films like the sea inside as it not only references history and gives us an insight into that but as a stand alone film delivers on an emotional and engaging level
<START> don't hate heather graham because she's beautiful hate her because she's fun to watch in this movie like the hip clothing and funky surroundings the actors in this flick work well together <UNK> affleck is hysterical and heather graham literally lights up the screen the minor characters <UNK> <UNK> sigh and patricia <UNK> are as talented as they are gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> director lisa krueger
<START> this was on the saturday before halloween this year today at the time of this writing and it has to be the best horror anthology out there i am normally not a fan of horror movies largely due to the volume of crap that's been recently released however the director of <UNK> tales has the hitchcock esquire gift of suspense unlike other contemporary films it doesn't take every opportunity to scare you silly instead using <UNK> and <UNK> incidents that seem like the instant that the climax will occur in the instant before but turn out not to be br br i didn't catch 'the or the first main segment but from what i have read here they were the two you could afford to miss br br <UNK> can <UNK> <UNK> was full of suspense this short keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she wanders about her yard and house looking for her soccer ball and later her dog she encounters so many near misses that the suspense reaches heart stopping proportions before the climax of the short when the girl gives up and goes to bed thinking her dog is underneath it she reaches her hand down to let him <UNK> it and she feels the touch of a tongue on her hand before <UNK> that on her mirror written in blood is <UNK> can <UNK> <UNK> i'll leave the last few seconds for you to find out my reader for at this point the short could have taken any number of turns br br 'the however was the masterpiece of this film it begins with a man on a motorcycle simply driving towards what he does not know but he can feel himself getting closer as he's driving along a storm breaks out and he's forced to find shelter in the house of a mute girl the two quickly <UNK> up to each other but before they can do anything besides kiss the girl reveals through writing that ghosts inhabit her house they quickly begin <UNK> up to leave but they are caught in the middle of a <UNK> of a scene decades past a father coming home to his daughter and her boyfriend preparing to <UNK> murders the both of them and then commits suicide i'll have to leave you to discover the ending here as well i couldn't hope to do the story justice in any case and what i've said so far is just a brief summary of the story i couldn't hope to convey the nuances and <UNK> details that add to it br br 'the being the connecting thread between all of the stories is a fairly interesting rehash of the car accident theme and the girls are very much attractive in fact most of the girls in this film are good looking anyway despite the fact that it's chopped up the story is given justice and the ending is difficult to predict if you're <UNK> with the other stories however if you pay enough attention to the segments of the <UNK> spread through the film it's certainly possible to predict the ending especially if you've seen movies based on the same premise mst3k fans remember same premise but without the god awful writing of vivian <UNK> and the bulk of the movie if you've seen the first 30 minutes of that you should be able to predict the ending all in all the best horror movie i've seen in a long time and the only horror anthology worthy of a buy
<START> this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself br br the movie starts of slow the storyline makes no sense at all people fighting doesn't make any sense i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie in most cases i didn't even bother it does nothing to keep you watching the movie the only plus point would be the cinematography new zealand looks awesome everything else just plain sucks br br the actors try their best to keep us awake but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead br br do us all a favor even if this gets on on demand don't watch it
<START> i felt i had to add a comment after seeing the breathless <UNK> of the other comment i was taken to see this film as a child by my <UNK> parents expecting a normal norman wisdom jolly romp comedy instead what you get is this insipid british sex comedy of the worst kind where norman norman plays a <UNK> aiming to get off with as many as possible absolutely typical of the genre poorly filmed and acted no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double <UNK> and very vague hints of and all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960's 1970's british low budget films about the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune which still pops up in my brain after 30 odd years br br finally in the last scene you also get to see norman naked running across the sand and looking frozen i think so anyway at that point my mother <UNK> me out of the cinema i saw it again many years later and guess what it was still dire br br if you're any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career you'll apply the <UNK> foot rule to this believe me you do not need to see norman <UNK>
<START> occasionally on talk shows a good <UNK> debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience unfortunately there is always some desperately sad person seeking acceptance who will end any interesting debate instantly by getting up and saying the proverbial everyone should get along and love each other as they know they are guaranteed to get applause and <UNK> as no one would dare disagree br br well they are the same people who marked this film as good why did they do that <UNK> anyway that's all i'll say on that matter br br the film it starts of reasonably interestingly so you hope it will build and if like me you've settled in with a nice couple of glasses of wine and some cheese then you will give it even more of a chance simply because you can't be bothered to move br br but then you <UNK> you wander your mind <UNK> of onto other things why because the director did too he took his foot off the gas and then he realized so to compensate he hard but then he <UNK> again and again so do you the story slows the plot <UNK> and almost disappears you even wonder to yourself <UNK> what happened again ' as you <UNK> your screen will show nick nolte running around with some supposed purpose but you will have long since cared as to what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen <UNK> in the background to your day dreaming br br michael <UNK> who plays john <UNK> has an amazing ability to speak without moving his lips or indeed his face somewhat like a <UNK> he must have gone to the nicolas cage school of <UNK> facial acting or he was attacked by the phantom <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> was to play <UNK> <UNK> but instead she played <UNK> <UNK> to perfection br br in all there are hundreds of thousands of films to see so leave this one to one of the last you see i've just wasted an evening watching it when i could have watched or done something else learn by my mistake nights off relaxing are precious so don't waste one watching this boring tale do anything else dust off that old game of practice <UNK> for the evening or have an argument with a loved one <UNK> your nose hair get rid of <UNK> files on our <UNK> it will be time better spent what ever you should choose
<START> unlike one of the reviewers below i don't think that a great and <UNK> career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of <UNK> <UNK> whereas it is good to see a british director attempting to break out of the confines of convention only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen at first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device but its only real contribution to the film is to test your <UNK> and patience seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2 dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex if you can forget the triple screen which granted is very hard to do you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script the audience is beaten into <UNK> by <UNK> upon <UNK> about the british class system the film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and <UNK> to sum up the <UNK> new clothes and a rather poor outfit too
<START> this movie was so stupid i couldn't believe what i was seeing as i was watching it it was like a huge train wreck i couldn't look away because it was just so horribly awful i can honestly say i've never seen anything this bad in my whole entire life it was so cheesy and the acting was just so <UNK> that i just kept thinking this just has to be some kind of a joke right nobody would actually make a movie this crappy on purpose right i really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't actually expect people to watch this with a straight face and i really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible acting on purpose and don't actually believe that they are good actors the drag queens are pretty funny to watch though and so are the cheesy special effects straight out of a bad 80's sci fi movie br br only watch this if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there is nothing left to watch at all i would give this a 0 if it were possible
<START> in the end credits of shadows after we read by john <UNK> some white letters on the screen can be seen the film you have just seen is improvised they say i am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because basically there's no film without a screenplay and many other reasons br br cassavetes pursued the same goal and he believed in the freedom of words shadows is the perfect example it's a film with no real main characters with no real main plot lines it's mostly people in different situations talking yes some of the situations are connected but cassavetes apparently always in a rush to get to the talking uses a fast forward technique when the characters are going somewhere or escaping from someone and are not speaking br br appearances are everything in this movie for example there's a brilliant score full of jazz influences and a lot of fantastic <UNK> and there's one character that says he's a jazz musician and plays the <UNK> ben all the characters' names are the same names the actors' however we never see him play the <UNK> or jam with a band he doesn't even talk about music and just wanders with his friends around the city they do talk a lot and about anything that's in their minds going from how intelligent each of them are to the hilarious analysis of a <UNK> br br shadows is funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above because these friends are not <UNK> the only important female character in the film <UNK> though wants to be an intellectual but again she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party about a book she's trying to write and about how to confront reality but nothing to do with being intellectual at that same party a woman is actually making an intellectual statement full of complexity and asks a guy beside her do you agree yes he says but you can tell he doesn't know what she's talking about br br another character a singer hugh talks about his glory days in occasions and we see him perform only once but no references to the musical industry there the focus of cassavetes is the <UNK> relationship with his manager rupert which most of the time involves <UNK> about trivial stuff and not real <UNK> talks so the <UNK> <UNK> important deal in shadows is the time he spends with his friends the intellectual wannabe girl's is her way of handling romantic relationships one of the movie's strong points and the <UNK> is the bond with his br br the reason why performances are not important in this movie is simple cassavetes needed people who could master <UNK> without <UNK> if they were actually good i believe some of them aren't but they surely know how to <UNK> in a scene and you can notice how well they do it shadows is not about performers it's about a way of making cinema based on the magic of conversation and there you could say that performances mean something br br that's why in every conversation the camera is like a stalker constantly on the eyes of every character constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech there's a scene where the <UNK> player and his friends are trying to pick up some girls they are three so each of them sits beside one girl the girls are three two in three different tables they all talk at the same time and the camera shoots through the table and sometimes the friends look at each other while they say whatever they are natural
<START> there are a few aspects to <UNK> movies and in particular wallace <UNK> that i would say make them so great the first is subtlety and observation the <UNK> of which is the character of <UNK> he doesn't speak he doesn't make any noise all he has are his eyes brow and body <UNK> and with these he <UNK> the film park manages to give us everything we need from this silent character through his expression the comedy and the emotion is conveyed through the of movements and it works superbly well br br watching the movie you have to be aware of the entire screen normally you'll be guided to things in the movies the screen won't be <UNK> too much there won't be many things to take your eyes away from the main clue or action park seems to need to look the other way with his movies he throws extra content at his audience there's action in the background to the side of the screen even off screen and there's just about always something in the <UNK> to catch your eye his movies are about multiple viewing and discovery they're layered with jokes and <UNK> action br br throughout this film there are layers of things happening on screen jokes in the <UNK> maybe on a jar label and background shadows that give away action you can imagine that for park the movies has always been an event and the movies he loves are ones which he wants to watch again and again this is what shows in his movies and in through his most beloved characters br br then there are the bizarre and wacky <UNK> which wallace make something which is reflected in the storyline and the twists and turns of the plot everything is bizarre and off the wall yet it seems so perfectly normal in this world you can imagine that inside park is the mind of wallace br br there's also one more thing that make these movies so unique and that's the <UNK> and precise hand animation i must admit i was concerned when i knew <UNK> was involved in the making of this movie and i thought that they would bring their computer animation experience to the <UNK> what i was scared of was wallace <UNK> becoming cgi <UNK> or at the smallest cgi being used to clean up the feel that the <UNK> brought to the movie br br not so you can still see and on the characters and far from distracting from the movie this just adds so much real feeling to it and a feeling of physical depth to the characters and the scene on screen br br so what of the movie well i must say that the plot twist was something i had thought about well before the film was in the cinema and it came as no surprise but that did not affect my enjoyment one little bit actually watching the twist unfold and the comic timing of the discovery and reactions was everything and it had me just as sucked in as if it was a thriller yet all the time i was laughing br br watching the movie was fascinating in various ways to see the animation completed how wild the <UNK> are how wallace is going to get into trouble and <UNK> get him out where all the cross references are in the movie and where all the jokes are i must admit afterwards talking with my friends i couldn't believe how much i had missed br br there's something different in this movie than with the others there's a new level of adult humour in here and i don't mean rude jokes although there are a couple that are just so british you can't help laughing i mean jokes that simply fly over kids heads but slap adults in the face the kind you are used to seeing come out of somewhere like pixar this just adds even more appeal to the movie br br okay though let me try and be a bit negative here i didn't notice the voices in this movie you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can <UNK> them well i was just too wrapped up in the movie to care or to notice who they were okay that's not negative let me try again the main plot wasn't as strong and gripping as i'd expected and i found myself being caught up in the side stories and the characters themselves again that's not a bad thing the film was just so much rich entertainment br br i honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this movie probably the worst thing i could say is that the title sequence at the end is quite repetitive until the final title really that's the worst i can say br br the story is a lot of fun well set up well written well executed there's <UNK> of fantastic characters in here not just wallace <UNK> there's so much happening on screen so many references and jokes check out the dresses of lady cheese jokes everywhere jokes for all the family the characters are superbly absorbing and you'll find that you've taken to them before you realise there's just so much in this movie for everyone br br there's so much i could say and write about but i know it will quickly turn into a <UNK> exercise for park and <UNK> it would also just turn into a series of this bit was really funny and there's a bit when and what i would rather do is tell you that this is a superb movie to go see it and to experience the whole thing for yourselves i will say though that the <UNK> are excellent
<START> just read through the other comments here and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot br br richard <UNK> and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand up comedy show great actors they are not enough about that br br as for the plot oh man every time the movie tries to fool you into believing the good guys are going to lose you know those scenes what the good guys loses oh i see it was just a trick it's done so terribly bad you can spot it a mile away br br it had 2 or 3 funny moments but not enough to save the day br br it's a little silly that these comments has to be 10 lines now a lot of people will fill it up with crap for it to be <UNK> being brief is an art
<START> as someone who has read all of <UNK> books and seen most of the movies based on them i must say that the 1980's version with anthony andrews and jane seymour was better than this it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot this new adaptation is less light hearted yet does not have as much depth either although there is some good acting the actors did not have much to work with nice costumes though
<START> this film is likely to be a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made the were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them they are sort of force <UNK> into the roles ironically it might have been funnier if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed upon them instead it has been forever <UNK> as part of a <UNK> to which it really doesn't deserve to belong
<START> what can i say about <UNK> twelve who thought that it would ever come to this a gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't <UNK> i found myself amazed at how bad this really was really i have never seen the ending properly because this film is just <UNK> i'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel br br what was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back the movie is just boring and so drag along that i can't ever sit through this it really is bad just stay as far repeat far away as possible from this movie it's worthless
<START> when i think about tv movies i always think of this film i have watched it a few times on sky movies it was terrible br br its been a long time since i have seen this film was just <UNK> and came across it on here s br br a linda <UNK> goes on holiday with her son william <UNK> at this holiday resort kinda place they meet up with paul johnson taxi driver owns a bar and kathy johnson br br its like a weird romantic thing william starts to fall for kathy and paul falls for linda br br some guy passes out in a street he has some mark on his arm joseph joseph was a deep sea diver who on some dive saw a light or something and converted to religion says he will take care of this person there is a gap in my memory then there is a wide out break of the virus i think linda offers her help to come up with a cure kathy gets infected william notices a mark on <UNK> arm with the virus also does joseph br br paul says some lines to joseph then joseph stumbles away the next time you see joseph he is <UNK> some how that information is used to cure the infected then there is a beach party the end
<START> just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather <UNK> this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's it did not really have any villains from the comics but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics powers were a bit different here too he had his <UNK> sense and he could climb walls but he was not nearly as strong as the spider man of the comics he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door <UNK> off he just was not the car <UNK> that the one from the comic book can be the show was set in los <UNK> so there were not as man buildings to swing from but they did okay with the web it is nice that this show actually has the web <UNK> and not <UNK> <UNK> of the movie i love the movies but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more <UNK> pants <UNK> that has the mechanical web <UNK> this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider man it is nice to see a <UNK> who does not basically live in the <UNK> like he does in the movies neither this show nor the movie though has a spider man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic still this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show
<START> this movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i waste my time on this i watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me i wonder how <UNK> could make such a movie it doesn't have any it feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing <UNK> music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many <UNK> songs looks fake and i wonder what role does <UNK> has in the movie bobby <UNK> is good at least he can act <UNK> needs to take some acting lessons rather than taking off his shirts in almost all the scenes the end was the most pathetic br br i watched boom boom after watching 300 the movie you guys can really imagine what i felt about this bollywood movie br br i really respect bollywood but please directors and producers get real not everything is fantasy
<START> <UNK> 101 is basically about a girl named <UNK> who <UNK> into an all boys <UNK> school during the first year that they <UNK> girls into it that raw plot line is i'll admit a pretty good idea although this show was meant for children a five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws first <UNK> is a cliché character her being super popular super attractive super smart and there s nothing wrong with her no girl is like that it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie <UNK> spears and increase her fame dana who appeared at the beginning of the first season is just plain mean however in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that dana is never nice nicole is too <UNK> and acts like a complete <UNK> but mysteriously gets straight <UNK> lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy deserving acting skills quinn is supposed to be super smart and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things she is also made out to be weird and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart while <UNK> lola and nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality chase and michael are very similar and i even sometimes get them confused logan is <UNK> rich and hands out millions like they're dollars <UNK> that rich i've also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that <UNK> girl who does nothing but act nice to them that's not funny that's mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people finally the school itself adds the <UNK> to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5 star <UNK> such as a <UNK> location <UNK> bar hot <UNK> <UNK> with free <UNK> machines pool <UNK> movie theater and the <UNK> for boys and girls to <UNK> go into the other <UNK> rooms at most <UNK> schools if a boy were to go into a girl's <UNK> or vice versa they would be <UNK> br br in conclusion <UNK> 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years in the <UNK> process
<START> this movie was fabulous it is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film the directing and camera shots are nearly flawless aside from the dog scene when he <UNK> the guys hand clearly in slow motion the plot is well written and realistic it was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that br br i would rate bruno as <UNK> second most interesting character of course bates is first robert walker plays a very believable maniac he didnt <UNK> the part which made it believable much the same how <UNK> didnt <UNK> his part overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans br br br br
<START> this is the question that <UNK> roy <UNK> and ian <UNK> ask themselves when they discover a parallel world of earth always hidden on the far side of the sun in this 1969 cult science fiction melodrama released here in america as journey to the far side of the sun the plot of the film was <UNK> by british writers <UNK> and sylvia anderson the creators of such tv shows as <UNK> the thunderbirds and space 1999 it is exceedingly weird at times <UNK> the influence of the twilight zone and even stanley kubrick's classic 2001 a space odyssey the visual effects work of derek <UNK> who would also later work on superman the movie holds up surprisingly well under the last three decades of special effects <UNK> and while they are not really on the same <UNK> level of the kubrick film they are very superb if you don't <UNK> a star wars type of a film and can overcome the occasionally trite dialogue <UNK> is a good film it was good enough for me to rank it a and consider it an <UNK> sci fi gem
<START> oh wow the character shares my name first name nick this movie as bad as the first one if not worse well at least there's an actual <UNK> in this movie an actual <UNK> that makes a better appearance in this film by better i mean longer the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through just to let you know when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back not only that but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide <UNK> how horrible life is after watching this film really it shows how desperate horror movies are today more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately this film should have been the final straw so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema that could make some actually good modern horror films this movie bites
<START> what a waste of talent although it appears that <UNK> in real life is a lot more like the vapid self absorbed character less character he portrays in this disappointing movie br br in art sometimes the empty spaces reveal more than the painted or created content what this movie reveals is the <UNK> and the <UNK> competing <UNK> <UNK> consciousness of the film's director writer it unintentionally shows the lack of awareness that a truly evolved deeply aware character should have and be tormented about in order to deserve audience empathy or sympathy or the lack of which is used to serve as a <UNK> tale to the audience but this film fails on either level in that regard br br the fact that cal the main character very much an antagonist not a protagonist in the true sense of the word has no empathy for anyone especially those most deserving of it which does not include him and that he has such overblown entitled self <UNK> <UNK> sympathy only for himself combined with the hallmark lack of <UNK> and no sense of guilt or awareness of his impact on others all <UNK> in this film to make him the epitome of the self involved arrested <UNK> <UNK> somehow this is now the gold standard for males on film and in the world at this point and time br br one of his <UNK> james <UNK> states with a laser true flash i bet you haven't done one good thing in life and i bet you won't it captures the absolute essence of the cal character something the other characters he over in the film seem to realize fairly quickly despite the director having <UNK> the deck to manipulate sympathy for cal that is a testament to the supporting <UNK> talent and skills br br <UNK> eventual has nothing to do with character development transformation or evolution of consciousness it has only to do with the ultimate <UNK> that until something better comes along he may as well be back in his <UNK> <UNK> status <UNK> of entitled where the living is easy and no one will demand that he grow up something of which he is <UNK> incapable and <UNK> in doing br br the film could have been pointed and intentional about showing the traps and <UNK> the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience consciousness but it excuses and <UNK> it instead in fact it <UNK> in self pity right along with the arrogant selfish emotionally <UNK> main character br br and it sure sent chills up my spine when thinking of the recent revelations about convicted murderer scott peterson br br if you want to see <UNK> at his most nuanced and full of an exciting potential that has never been truly realized in my opinion see the underrated the
<START> i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded it talks of violence and what there doing i still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists we have similar people in the united states and other countries <UNK> the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right think of the <UNK> and the christian <UNK> against the <UNK> people during the medieval times lots of blood and death far <UNK> the violence of today the western world has had a negative impact on the religion i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some but still do remember the majority of the <UNK> people are peaceful people of any nation feel some sort of <UNK> but to start a war on the fact that i'm right and your wrong needs to be <UNK> again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them
<START> i cannot comprehend how this picture was allowed to be made it is mostly if not completely inaccurate so much so that the main character does not even resemble how history has him look physically this movie made me go on the internet and go through my books to make sure i remember <UNK> personality correctly for god's sake i have a book that lists <UNK> as one of the most evil person's of the world and the movie made me feel bad for him i must say character seemed close to my understanding of her both physically and psychologically although the actors all did a good job the movie was terrible and i'm sure i will not watch any others made by this sorry team
<START> michael writes and directs this <UNK> story based on the arrest of edward <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> was responsible for a <UNK> of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's his evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his <UNK> <UNK> mother ed was given the <UNK> the butcher of he would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who <UNK> his mother and he would have sex with them before them like a in his garage severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark after his arrest there would be many <UNK> made from human skin found in his home in this movie a young deputy bobby mason shawn hoffman makes the search for <UNK> kane <UNK> a personal one when his <UNK> mother <UNK> barnes goes missing the acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning <UNK> also in the cast <UNK> timothy john burke michael <UNK> and amy <UNK>
<START> enchanting the best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad it's all just so cute all even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end also the achievement the two young actors of <UNK> and <UNK> gave it's music is also very nice the two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once he'll see the snow queen is not so bad she only tries to surround herself with love in the wrong way the evening this movie was on here first part i only watched it because i was bored but i loved it a lot more after and was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the funeral yeah that was terribly sad for me but when they said it will be on next week i was so happy that i recorded it and now i'm glad to have done so
<START> having recently seen <UNK> i was <UNK> in video usa looking for some movies that might have played in real <UNK> theatres in downtown areas during the '70s the hong kong action flick five fingers of death seemed just such a picture the cartoon like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while i was so involved in the story and the characters i didn't care parts of the music score sounded like the <UNK> tv theme song that was subsequently used in quentin <UNK> kill bill movies some scenes involving the hero's fiancé seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didn't ruin the film the most exciting parts involve the <UNK> and some revenge segments after that well worth seeing for kung fu fans
<START> people have often been uncomfortable with the <UNK> of <UNK> due to its anti <UNK> subject matter fortunately this movie avoids that <UNK> instead to show how anti <UNK> <UNK> supreme in <UNK> century europe the story of course is that antonio jeremy <UNK> needs money so that he can help joseph <UNK> ask for <UNK> collins hand in marriage he gets the money from jewish <UNK> <UNK> al pacino who demands a pound of <UNK> flesh if the latter doesn't pay back the <UNK> when antonio can't pay back the <UNK> <UNK> is determined to get what is <UNK> him br br we would expect this cast to do a good job and they don't disappoint it is yet another testament to what a great actor al pacino is
<START> let's see what annoyed me most the extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people <UNK> around so much i got <UNK> without even showing where the music was coming from all part of a college <UNK> that had nothing to do with the rest of the film or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to what a drag this film is and the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second <UNK> these people are bad these people are good whenever a movie has its agenda heart on its <UNK> i am beside myself there's a scene in a <UNK> that seems totally out of place long drawn out love scenes with the main character and a russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy <UNK> john <UNK> character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and <UNK> with the overdone villains his death scene could very well be the stupidest in history and i hear everyone even the <UNK> of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is i think it looks washed out watch days of heaven if you want to see gorgeous this movie is even worse than the anti hype it's pointless the <UNK> showing the main character in a <UNK> was almost as dumb as the prologue the battle scenes are tedious and <UNK> this movie is really bad avoid it unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them
<START> i bought this movie sight unseen at a sci fi convention and i got what i deserved for doing something so silly simply put this movie is implausible boring and unwatchable br br i was so bored and disgusted with the lack of plot development that i turned it off to watch a repeat of i understand that this was a very low budget move or least it looked like a very low budget move but that does not excuse the horrible acting terrible plot and even worse camera work it looks like something a group of college students did in between classes and getting drunk br br maybe if the villain wasn't so laughable and the plot was something that actually could happen in real life with respect to law <UNK> it might become so bad it's funny this movie isn't funny it's just bad
<START> the films use of blue black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work in fact its quite irritating as it <UNK> the demon characters and <UNK> them to one dimensional beings br br at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set pieces were quite stunning black gore is hardly frightening nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to <UNK> and <UNK> at the screen in her best camp lugosi style br br the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine <UNK> directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william <UNK> <UNK> otherwise give this film a wide <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fans once again are <UNK> disappointed
<START> a must see documentary this movie had so many things to consider while watching it it was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named butler he accused of killing a white tourist in florida it shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife the husband seemed to want to change some things to <UNK> with what the police said the young man was wearing the police little to investigate the crime lawyer patrick is <UNK> in getting information to help his client he tells the viewers what he thinks and the <UNK> he will use on the police to show their <UNK> investigation and <UNK> against his young client to get him to confess the camera goes with to where was <UNK> also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is <UNK> he questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard say to one of the <UNK> and he challenges their own words <UNK> with ann each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not the movie shows the <UNK> as a loving christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that god will set free they visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him there are scenes of group <UNK> for the lawyers the judge and everyone involved in this case i am a white and i was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks it was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man police have a hard job and i believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie i think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the <UNK> system including judges police and lawyers and even potential <UNK> to watch this movie and learn from it
<START> i absolutely hated this movie i was 9 when i saw it it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater my mom dad and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life everything about it was ridiculous the entire premise was too <UNK> being 9 i was always easily entertained this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained
<START> i remember coming home from school to watch up and coming this was the story of a black family that moves out of the into a up class community the family was name wilson frank wilson man with his own construction business his wife <UNK> was a bank manager they had 3 teenage kids kevin valerie and marcus this was a very good show it was educational with out being the show was well written this show gave us a look at a successful african american before the <UNK> show a lot a black actor appeared on this show from <UNK> role to david to <UNK> jackson to name a few if you are able to find this show on dvd you should get it for your whole family
<START> life is crazy you're crazy i'm crazy we're all crazy we're all a little bit <UNK> and a little bit <UNK> sometimes it does seem best to be sensible but then what might you be missing out on br br you gotta be you you don't have to park cars and semi randomly yell at people but you can't hide yourself behind a <UNK> or dark <UNK> and pretend and act like everything is okay and sometimes you really do have to throw caution to the wind because why else are you alive br br i'm not going to this love compared to <UNK> other movies because they are all absolutely 100 unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives in that sense they are all great and comparisons are <UNK> for sure this movie has that one crazy sometimes <UNK> but ultimately wonderful and <UNK> quality that all his movies have you never know what's going to happen next and you never know what the characters are going to think do or feel next neither do the characters themselves and do we really want to live our lives any other way unlike <UNK> you can have a great job and <UNK> away money into your ira but still live the life of an <UNK> inside in your feelings your spirit and your very experience of life yeah we can have it both ways that's what cassavetes shows us thank god somebody did
<START> what in the world this piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the lifetime network michael is a good actor but i think his portrayal as <UNK> fell short the montages were unbearable and too many the supporting cast where are you whoever did the casting should be partially at fault the cinematography was useless a gambling story with an after school feel to it stories of this sort should be left for the oliver <UNK> of the world it would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch it was an attempt that lost it's <UNK> before the race ever begun mario <UNK> in the 1982 <UNK> 500 came to mind
<START> i've lost count of the times i have seen this movie but i love it and find it very funny each time i see it the facial expressions slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes makes it great the characters especially <UNK> <UNK> and are hilarious i thought <UNK> <UNK> rip torn and bruce dern did a great job in fact i think this movie was perfectly cast i think it does need to be released in dvd before i wear my vhs version out
<START> by randolph scott standards of the 1950s this is a disappointing and heavy handed star western two or three of the characters could be <UNK> with while two or three other characters could be given more <UNK> the humour needs to be completely <UNK> de <UNK> handles the action well as always but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak
<START> i know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won't do as a film about vietnam <UNK> <UNK> was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out br br this film stars gene hackman who is korean war vet assigned to train a group of <UNK> tag <UNK> <UNK> vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of american <UNK> held at a camp there these men include a former tunnel rat a crazy acid dropping sailor a blond <UNK> <UNK> from california and some inexperienced kid patrick <UNK> who just so happens had a dad that was killed in <UNK> they train first at some camp in texas and once in <UNK> they are found out and lose all their weapons they are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men most of the men are found and saved but the <UNK> tag group is mostly wiped out br br this movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush and who was going to die and who was going to live <UNK> <UNK> i'm guessing was not like a video game
<START> i didn't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed carrie looked ugly mr big had his <UNK> colored with <UNK> and samantha didn't say f br br <UNK> kid was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes the title could easily have been parents' night out camera angles just weren't that good especially regarding <UNK> face br br there was a token black woman thrown in whose character doesn't have a proper exit and too few appearances by the gay men friends who seemed thrown in with no purpose anyway <UNK> going back and forth from la <UNK> the story flow especially when she comes in for fashion week and nothing happens br br the movie seems to have been made in rush because it could have been good but scenes were just thrown in to show different outfits or to offer viewers a chance to jump back in the show without adding much to the story of the movie
<START> i'm not much for cop movies but this one is supposedly a classic when i found it cheap i bought it and stuck it on a shelf only to finally get around to watching it yesterday and i liked it now you can have new york city but as a setting for a film like this in the winter months it's perfect roy <UNK> is a member of an elite police task group called the seven ups which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover in an opening scene they recover a <UNK> full of money from an <UNK> store by distracting the crooks with a bull in a china shop routine but that's only the beginning seems that there are two guys posing as cops that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for <UNK> richard lynch happens to be one of these sleaze <UNK> and he's as creepy as ever when one of the seven ups who is posing as a <UNK> driver at a funeral gets his cover blown he's beaten and stuffed into the <UNK> of a car which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases i've seen amazing though how light traffic in nyc is for chase scenes but still this is rather amazing as <UNK> follows the two <UNK> through what i'm guessing is the <UNK> and then onto a and then eventually <UNK> car comes to a <UNK> halt in one of the most heart stopping <UNK> to a chase scene that i've ever witnessed anyway since the cop ends up dying <UNK> and his men are under suspicion because the police <UNK> knows so little about their activities he wonders if they're on the make by kidnapping <UNK> so of course this kind of thinking needs to be <UNK> in the bud <UNK> is relentless getting to the bottom of things overall a decent cop action drama not really my thing but i liked this one look for joe <UNK> maniac in a small role 7 out of 10
<START> i totally agree this is pitch black underground and a well worn plot the best scenes i thought were the <UNK> exploring the <UNK> going through impossible <UNK> <UNK> some of them were heart <UNK> the scenery was great had they <UNK> with the <UNK> alien <UNK> cgi entirely the movie would have been much better all they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering and follow jack's descent into madness and this might have been a top rate hitchcock style thriller maybe award material the acting isn't bad but those rubber bats just <UNK> it to standard fare
<START> jealous husband holds car <UNK> hostage while williams <UNK> the viewer with his worn out <UNK> <UNK> at every turn yawn br br pay channel <UNK> an <UNK> bad script coupled with a less than convincing robin williams as a slick talking <UNK> queens car salesman caught up in a hostage <UNK> crisis the laughs aren't there the message s or morals are just all wrong and the film cant ever decide on whether its a comedy or drama pretty good cast all acting pretty badly when a movie ages so badly so quickly you got yourself a stinker not much else to be said other than maybe avoid at all costs <UNK> mediocre movies like this are actually more tedious and less enjoyable than the over the top bombs
<START> the best thing i can say about <UNK> is that it's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewing br br but that doesn't mean it's good br br this weird sci fi thriller is not quite like any other movie i've ever seen which i guess at least gives it the <UNK> of novelty but it's a borderline disaster of a movie and one of the worst robert altman ever made on the dvd special feature about the making of <UNK> it's clear that even altman didn't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be br br it's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age the film was shot at the abandoned site of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an <UNK> over shopping mall paul newman looking <UNK> out and absolutely <UNK> in anything going on around him and <UNK> <UNK> play <UNK> who wander into this futuristic city looking for <UNK> brother soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of <UNK> which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you're playing with and remain the only person alive this gives these <UNK> inhabitants their only thrill because as one of them says at one point in a <UNK> only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive br br the movie is slow ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its <UNK> it's almost as if altman was <UNK> setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through there aren't characters oh sure actors walk around speaking lines but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a <UNK> only <UNK> gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this but nevertheless it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly <UNK> himself to death would be fascinating br br altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films <UNK> followed close on the heels of the atrocious a wedding and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable a perfect couple the by all accounts terrible health which i've never seen because it's not available anywhere to see and the disastrous <UNK> thank god he <UNK> br br grade d
<START> this movie was lacking in a lot of areas it's about this elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these <UNK> from <UNK> angels one of them is named <UNK> and they beat up college kids for fun they want the elvis guy to be their driver at times i wanted the folks from to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good sure there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines such as what kind of beer do you want a cold one that was cheesy the dude who plays <UNK> is a great boxer and i was glad to see him do a few fight scenes also the biker named <UNK> had a nazi <UNK> on his jacket that was pretty bold if i must say so myself
<START> jennifer grey seems the of romantic leads and that's probably the reason why this beloved film is such a sure fire hit it's all very well doing a version of and <UNK> with like dancing and <UNK> jewish society family <UNK> thrown in but there usually has to be an x factor br br <UNK> probably makes this film safe with his rugged post travolta moves and <UNK> but its being won over by this curly <UNK> penelope teen that brings the dream in reach of the <UNK> market the super dated perhaps soundtrack helps and of course the cunning <UNK> of setting the film in a resort away from day to day life altogether the fantasy 7 10
<START> film starts off great in with a violent bloody fight between dracula christopher lee and van <UNK> peter cushing dracula is <UNK> and <UNK> to dust van <UNK> also dies somebody <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> them in the grounds of a church cut to 1972 here's where the film falls apart br br we are instantly hit over the head with loud bad 70s music horrible fashions and silly dialogue when this was made hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get a hit putting dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea the fashions music and dialogue date the movie horribly we're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their <UNK> who decide to have a black mass for a giggle naturally they have it at the church now abandoned and naturally revive dracula it's a good thing a <UNK> of van <UNK> is around but dracula goes after his niece stephanie <UNK> in revenge br br lee and cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they're on screen the movie gets a much needed shot of energy the opening and ending battles are the highlights of the film although the ending is spoiled a lot by playing lousy 70s music also the main <UNK> of the kids is named johnny <UNK> christopher a truly stupid name that dates back to the 1940s the film also has scream queen caroline <UNK> looking absolutely great the film is well directed and pretty well acted but the plot is stupid the constant <UNK> of 70s fashion dialogue and music gets annoying real quick and i was basically bored silly br br most hammer fans agree this was one of the worst dracula movies it's <UNK> <UNK> of dracula was the worst and the last hammer dracula film this gets a 2 just for cushing and lee
<START> i saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic and i must admit that it <UNK> my <UNK> <UNK> seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise but what a <UNK> <UNK> corny is not the word for the script and the characterizations are often ludicrous the stupid daughter is just beyond belief she is supposed to be 13 not 4 but then the scientists <UNK> and <UNK> characters don't offer any more this movie ranks just in front of cruise ii and <UNK> but only because those 2 films are completely appalling this does have some reasonable effects but overall its a 1 out of 10 don't waste your time
<START> i'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity the shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film erika <UNK> never anything you'd call a <UNK> anyway seems to have <UNK> into anna nicole smith in her big period daniel <UNK> i almost shed a tear he's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts <UNK> as seen in the <UNK> series also b movies but if you like martial arts <UNK> watchable here he is a shell of his former self sure he's older but doing the <UNK> thing and not even looking interested i just don't get it don't these people <UNK> william forsythe is another heavy that i've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call <UNK> it in i'm not going to even mention mr reynolds his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more the only winner is andrew <UNK> as usual a creepy evil villain with a <UNK> voice that can milk the best kind this is a movie you watch for laughs there's nothing else to it
<START> a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly <UNK> or over indulgent nine out of ten for a truly lovely film
<START> let me be clear i hate these kinds of movies i do not like anything where the protagonists are all <UNK> english i find this kind of literature and film awfully pretentious you will never get me to read a jane austen book willingly that said the only reason i read w <UNK> <UNK> book and watched the subsequent film was for a class br br mary <UNK> scott thomas is a beautiful english woman living in a borrowed villa in <UNK> before world war ii one night after <UNK> with some of her rich <UNK> related friends she willingly picks up an <UNK> <UNK> has sex with him and <UNK> and then he kills himself as the movie gets further and further you really want to dislike mary br br what a load of crap this movie was first of all there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that weren't even in the book i doubt very much the late mr <UNK> would've appreciated them the characters though wealthy were some of the most superficial and self centered people i have ever seen br br the only reason i didn't give it anything less than three stars was because the acting was the only thing <UNK> the always talented <UNK> scott thomas is perfect for the role of mary in fact i couldn't picture anybody else filling her shoes sean penn and anne <UNK> also had supporting roles that were just as good as the lead br br save yourself the pain of watching this movie
<START> this film is excellent fear of watching documentary movies <UNK> your shrink and watch little story you won't believe how captivating this fine piece of film making is until you have experienced it i'm eager to say that it even out goes almost any vietnam war movie including apocalypse now it's a real story it's a personal story a story about the love for flying the dream of being a pilot and the nightmare of being shot down above <UNK> territory all is shot in a return to style at location <UNK> asking the questions <UNK> answering them in a memorable german english accent and with fine <UNK> pointing out what happened where about 25 years before there is this part that i told friends over and over again <UNK> out from his us navy plane <UNK> becomes a <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> for the greater part of the days he is being dragged through the <UNK> asian jungle for miles and miles on bare feet tortured insulted <UNK> and covered with wounds they arrive in a small friendly village to spend the night the next morning after walking for several hours <UNK> discovers someone stole his wedding ring from his finger that is it he can take no more he starts to cry as a result of complete <UNK> the <UNK> men react surprised <UNK> manages to explain what happened immediately the group returns to the village and starts searching for the person that stole the ring they find the man immediately chop of his finger and return the ring to <UNK> the movie is full of these mind <UNK> and surprising situations the immense cultural differences the clash of east and west the fear of the unknown i e all that stands for america on the one hand the asian jungle and his secrets on the other can be <UNK> the entire movie back problems that's because you sat at the edge of your seat for two hours and didn't notice
<START> glenn ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and <UNK> stable owner <UNK> to stage a fake robbery while the <UNK> hides the real <UNK> with ford a no show the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice leaving ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit br br columbia <UNK> first color feature the <UNK> looks fantastic with sets and costumes <UNK> to take full advantage of the technicolor process <UNK> tons of well staged western spectacle br br this has the irresistible <UNK> of a young glenn ford third billed but essentially the star and a prime randolph scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles including scene <UNK> <UNK> as a good natured but mildly villainous <UNK> who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines br br a fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences melodrama and comedy well directed by charles <UNK> this is one of the great westerns of the <UNK> forties and highly recommended
<START> awesome movie great combination of talents i'm a huge fan of david duchovny and he is outstanding in this movie i would love to see him in more movies of this nature his talents are definitely under used and has so much more to offer besides agent <UNK> although i'm a huge fan of that series too anyway i want to see more of him he is easily the cary grant of our generation if you haven't seen this movie you must great love story that shows love never dies it's with you forever <UNK> driver is great and how can you go wrong with a cast containing mr <UNK> and mr <UNK> and mr belushi this movie didn't get any type of awards nod but deserved one great job bonnie hunt by the way the soundtrack is great too
<START> this definitely the most tension filled x files episode of the first season this episode is what i think of when i hear x files the plot is simple but <UNK> our main cast plus a few scientist go to investigate an <UNK> in which it's research team appears to have killed each other it turns out a small <UNK> that got <UNK> up from the ice had infected the research team the <UNK> <UNK> itself to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity soon none can tell who they can trust or who's infected or not br br this episode was a direct tribute to john <UNK> great horror film the thing the thing is set in <UNK> and a team of scientist find a destroyed <UNK> in which it's <UNK> have been killed or killed themselves an alien that had been buried in the ice for a years had been out it has the abilities to imitate any life form therefore the main characters can no longer distinct friends from <UNK> br br believe me the thing is one of the most <UNK> and tension filled horror movies you'll ever see if you liked the episode ice i advice you to see it or if you have only seen the thing i advice you to see ice br br ice is the best direct tribute homage to john carpenter's the thing i have ever seen and it lives up to it's inspiration as one of the best x files episodes i give it a 10 10
<START> i really enjoy this movie the first time it was on turner classic movies all the actors did very well but <UNK> steals the show again like always he is so sexy this is one of the movie that you do see emotions actually this movie this is the first i ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong larger than life and serious roles in other movies in this movie you see both a <UNK> tough and sensitive side of <UNK> <UNK> seems to be a in this movie that is amazing how <UNK> eats the glass cup and speaks in his russian tongue it drives me crazy in love i don't understand when both <UNK> and kerr they both have very good chemistry stars in a movie together and then <UNK> always die at the end it kind of reminds you the king and i in a way
<START> hollywood movies since the 1930s have treated gays as <UNK> in <UNK> homosexuality the film industry has reflected only what the <UNK> society of its day <UNK> as an ideology for example in the <UNK> otto preminger melodrama advise and <UNK> straight actor don murray was cast as a <UNK> <UNK> who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle gay movie characters have covered a lot of ground since advise and <UNK> in the 1997 movie in out 1 2 out of <UNK> actor kevin kline is cast as a homosexual teacher who comes out of the closet on his wedding day while the conservative hollywood of <UNK> that the <UNK> <UNK> in advise and <UNK> had to commit suicide the liberal hollywood of today <UNK> that the gay english teacher should be <UNK> rather than br br basically in out <UNK> good <UNK> in the <UNK> of a politically correct comedy director frank oz and <UNK> scott <UNK> honesty as the best policy because honesty always <UNK> happiness high school teacher howard <UNK> kevin kline of the big chill will be happy only after he comes out of the closet just as his once fat but now thin fiancée emily joan cusack will only feel happy when she can <UNK> her <UNK> ultimately the movie <UNK> that straight society will accept gays when <UNK> can act with greater honesty and <UNK> about themselves the happily gay <UNK> reporter played by straight actor tom <UNK> here effectively <UNK> this open minded commentary br br lightweight script <UNK> the true life incident that occurred at the oscars when tom hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher in in out cameron drake matt dillon a blond brad pitt style bimbo type actor wins the oscar for <UNK> a <UNK> foot soldier drake <UNK> his mentor howard <UNK> during his acceptance speech not <UNK> to stop there the <UNK> cameron reveals to a live television audience that howard is gay suspicion paranoia and horror set in as the media <UNK> upon the sleepy town of green <UNK> indiana when would a no name high school english <UNK> sexual <UNK> spark such massive media concern among those <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> tom <UNK> of high road to china and he wants to do a week long <UNK> one on howard howard however wants nothing to do with the witch hunting media especially the <UNK> peter <UNK> howard <UNK> <UNK> gay charges to everybody including his fiancée and his mom <UNK> <UNK> because he <UNK> a scoop the revelation has turned green <UNK> upside down high school principal tom <UNK> bob <UNK> <UNK> with all the media coverage <UNK> warns howard that were his marriage not <UNK> he'd have to give him a pink slip meanwhile peter <UNK> howard that his marriage to emily will fall through at the last moment and he'll be there to record the result on camera br br howard <UNK> to audio tapes about macho men he struggles to <UNK> himself but <UNK> efforts are <UNK> guilt <UNK> up inside him and then there is peter <UNK> who <UNK> him to come clean about his homosexuality finally at the <UNK> in the sight of god howard bursts of course bride to be emily <UNK> is <UNK> by <UNK> gay confession predictably the school fires howard but he shows up for <UNK> drake shows up too and rushes to defense not only has the school stripped howard of his job but they've also given his teacher of the year award to somebody else drake appeals to the principal and wins howard the <UNK> support of the community br br the biggest <UNK> in contrived script is howard himself has created a character too <UNK> to be true either by gray or straight standards howard <UNK> <UNK> as more of a saint than a <UNK> he helps one student gain admission to college and he <UNK> the track team how often do you hear of an english teacher <UNK> as a coach too everybody at his high school <UNK> howard he doesn't have a mean bone in his body further and oz ask us to believe that nobody else in green <UNK> is gay where are <UNK> gay friends are they too scared to come to his defense no in out is not targeted strictly at homosexual audiences oz whose screen credits include cute comedies like dirty rotten <UNK> and house <UNK> as well as <UNK> on a politically correct <UNK> in out is not a gay <UNK> movie the filmmakers show no interest in what <UNK> either howard or peter <UNK> to prefer the gay lifestyle instead oz and are only interested in up a thin premise is he or isn't he gay they flesh it out to involve the community response to the answer finally when howard admits that he is gay the filmmakers <UNK> the rest of the movies to showing how a conservative norman <UNK> like town can accept him despite his difference br br the most shocking scenes in in out is probably when <UNK> reporter <UNK> does a lip lock on howard straight guys kissing each other in a movie about a gay identity crisis are as hilarious as they are phony kline and <UNK> <UNK> their faces together in what appears as more of a head on <UNK> than a closed mouth kiss nothing at all like the controversial 1994 british movie priest in out emerges as an engaging but <UNK> piece of social propaganda with its okay to be act message if ellen weren't the tv equivalent in out would probably be heading toward tv as a new sitcom watching in out is not so much about dealing with the issue of gay or straight but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century what makes in out a tolerable comedy about sexual <UNK> is its equal opportunity cheers and <UNK> about and <UNK>
<START> this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen i gave it one star simply because it is the lowest score possible whoever thought <UNK> would ever be a good film the director and cast should be ashamed and then it <UNK> on me this could all be part of a <UNK> scare <UNK> only propaganda could be this bad br br the redeeming feature of <UNK> is that it's <UNK> and shameless formulaic storyline make it funny if only the characters had the same depth as created by the <UNK> itself yet they from sound bite to sound bite without any emotional response whatsoever br br the sad thing about this film is that it could have been so much better informative imaginative and tense <UNK> has the amateur streak to found in many recent british films where a more focused use of <UNK> would have made for a better entertainment br br where was <UNK>
<START> i never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused especially in french and the <UNK> countries in <UNK> where i am located for example <UNK> <UNK> was announced as the most shocking and the most thought provoking social drama you could ever experience yeah right it might be a little shocking maybe how often do you see someone getting shot up the <UNK> but the weak and pointless plot surely didn't cause me to think much <UNK> <UNK> is another one of those blame everything that goes wrong on society films and they're generally not very convincing about 99 of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged <UNK> girls the two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced <UNK> and in flashes <UNK> just killed her roommate <UNK> shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train station late at night they decide to travel around france together leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop although we're constantly exposed to pornography and violence this film is very boring to sit through like the girls are <UNK> themselves all the time the dialogues are lame and the people they run into and are very uninteresting if people want to make porno movies that's fine by me but please don't pretend that it's art house film making if you leave out the swearing and the hip camera work all there is to see is not so <UNK> pornography cool soundtrack though
<START> wow this <UNK> took place from 3 different cities this was the very first wrestling pay per view i ever saw and it's a good one indeed there is a great steel cage match for the main event as hulk hogan takes on king kong <UNK>
<START> i've never really been sure whether i liked this documentary or not it was shown on channel 4 before a cut down version of revelations and is on the revelations video tape before the uncut show the documentary is basically friends of bill saying how great he was for an hour with video clips of the show mixed in a bit like a trailer for the film you're about to watch it also features david <UNK> <UNK> like a worm for <UNK> bill off the his show before he died the reason bill made a joke about how pro life people should <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> had pro life advertising anyway look out for the video as revelations is bill at his <UNK> best
<START> first let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is so the book may have been great but the movie isn't br br i have spent my entire life living in the region of <UNK> i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie i have lived in two small <UNK> towns and charlotte and <UNK> on occasion you will meet people with a strong southern accent but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the wind br br in response to gore won from the <UNK> community your comments reveal more about your <UNK> psyche than it does about the movie if we were to stretch our <UNK> and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie which there isn't then the truth is that bad people such as father will always find some justification for their actions the author chose religion as a counter to supernatural abilities your that the true character of the <UNK> directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and interpretation i have ever heard before you start <UNK> off about the <UNK> maybe you should read them first br br back to the movie the dialog is flat unnatural and unbelievable most of the time in particular many of the things that said to <UNK> are inappropriate and do not match the mood context or way they are said br br the exciting twist at the end of the movie is lame predictable and lacks any credibility some have also claimed that <UNK> <UNK> does a wonderful job in this movie but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale predictable one dimensional character is that fault i don't know br br if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old <UNK> of the muppet show i recommend the muppet show
<START> this movie may not have seemed like much to some people but it had everything i look for in a comedy fall down funny moments accompanied by a moment or two of seriously moving scenes great actors and pretty much everything a good movie is supposed to be like despite david spade playing his usual <UNK> character he made this role into an unusual performance which i don't think he had ever <UNK> until he hit the screen with joe dirt regardless of whether or not some people were not chris <UNK> fans i saw this film when it came out and my friends and i still talk about it 11 years later this movie was what finally told me that chris <UNK> was the real deal he is the best comedian i have seen in my life in the words of some he could be clumsy clever funny serious crazy sober and moving or depressing at the same time not the same words but the message is all that counts one of the true great actors of our time and one of the true great <UNK> of all time along with good acting good story hilarious moments serious scenes that at times brought me to tears this movie stands <UNK> the <UNK> as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by the late great chris <UNK> no actor before or since has captured my interests in a movie since because no actor before or since has put so much into his movies this movie is worth the time if you haven't taken the time to see it do so the next time you rent a movie
<START> <UNK> the man is great its funny original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of <UNK> man trouble but leaving the movie i had a grin <UNK> on my face the story is a bit out there with the whole no one <UNK> that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history amanda b did a great job as the main role and <UNK> <UNK> looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous duke so girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls br br all in all a brilliant fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on dvd when it comes out
<START> hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler a real acting stretch named rip who is forced to defend his honor his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network because wrestling sells however when rip <UNK> the network gets a circuit fighting championship called and i'm totally serious battle of the tough guys who's champion <UNK> played by tiny <UNK> jr maybe the <UNK> man alive rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital no holds <UNK> is pretty much what i expected from vince <UNK> production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre hogan it is basically lots of unintentional humor tons of awkward sequences a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity in other words it's not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious they're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself such as the way hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a <UNK> how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan <UNK> from his i e i'm not going to be around when this check <UNK> no holds <UNK> is a lot of fun true though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is fans of camp should really enjoy this clever <UNK> br br out of 4 fair
<START> has a delightfully fresh script acted superbly by both young and old actors alike john doyle has done an excellent job bringing humour to a tragic true story keeping a sometimes sad story fun and engrossing particularly to those of us not familiar with the events of south east asia during ww2 br br john <UNK> parallel story line successfully bridges the gap between past and present allowing the audience insight into the long term effect war had on the prisoners and their family's lives as well as providing the basis for an excellent narrative which nicely rounds out the tales both individual and collective doyle deserves praise for this effort we have in the past been delighted by his <UNK> and quick witted humour as <UNK> in his long running collaboration with greg as roy h g ' br br as the series is approaching half way we are looking forward to how the story develops with anticipation
<START> one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me br br the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and <UNK> scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or <UNK> this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word br br it is called oz as that is the <UNK> given to the <UNK> maximum security state it focuses mainly on <UNK> city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass <UNK> and face so <UNK> is not high on the agenda em city is home to many <UNK> muslims <UNK> <UNK> christians italians irish and more so <UNK> death stares dodgy <UNK> and shady <UNK> are never far away br br i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz doesn't mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn't say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got <UNK> to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards <UNK> be sold out for a <UNK> inmates <UNK> kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison <UNK> due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing thats if you can get in touch with your darker side
<START> spoilers follow and i haven't even seen it br br let me guess the murder is related to the evil property <UNK> wanting to develop the <UNK> and dickens was murdered because he was trying to <UNK> a similar <UNK> plot if anybody who's seen it could let me know if i'm half right you'll have saved me the time it might take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to steer clear of both this film and its enthusiastic reviewers on the other hand it sounds intriguing but if it was any good would it really be given away with a sunday <UNK> and what sort of track record does <UNK> have anyway br br so as a public service i managed to sit through it it's worse than <UNK> <UNK> really i've read stories by eight year olds with more drama than this truly awful and i was half right
<START> i just watched <UNK> on dvd in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch he never should have tried to become another spielberg this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen if can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind
<START> this was a great movie and safe for the entire family which one doesn't see much of anymore my wife and i and 15 year old son loved it even though you had an <UNK> of how it would end it continued to be a fun journey and the final ending surprised us there should be more movies like this
<START> this was one of the worst films i can remember seeing i am sure i have seen worse though if that me <UNK> it br br the humor isn't funny there are stupid stereotype jokes that again aren't funny i was a captive audience on a plane and viewed this film it was a complete waste of time i enjoyed martin in earlier films but not this one same for queen <UNK> she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too but this role was horrid br br i mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script i feel strongly you can't save a formulaic unfunny script with decent actors this movie as a case in point still all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film i am just amazed that something so bad can get <UNK> made released <UNK> and promoted
<START> unbelievably close to real life feelings and emotions captured by joseph as a child affected by aids and his new young neighbor a wanna be tough redneck played to perfection by brad although the story may seem slightly <UNK> the two boys attempt to river raft several hundred miles to find a doctor who claims to have the cure to aids the emotion actions and interactions of all characters involved are <UNK> close to real life being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released i strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with aids superb direction by peter <UNK> creates the perfect mood and setting for each scene and draws the viewer into the various emotions affected by friendship illness prejudice and the final <UNK> of two friends who fought hard to overcome <UNK>
<START> first of all it is sheer joy to hear the legend perform such wonderful and timeless music this movie and soundtrack is a tour de force ray charles is unique and amazing i truly <UNK> the film as it was inspiring and entertaining throughout br br jamie foxx has become one of the premiere actors in hollywood as is clearly shown in ray and he should get an oscar for this role it is <UNK> in fact everyone who worked on this film should receive <UNK> i really liked <UNK> washington who played the exceptional wife ray charles obviously married well <UNK> king is a fine actress as well as the extraordinary sharon warren who plays a struggling young mother br br in all honesty i'd say this whole project was arranged the entire cast was perfect great screenplay and awesome settings major props to the director taylor and crew for doing such a splendid job in bringing the life of ray charles to the screen so <UNK> this is my picture of the year certainly one of the best <UNK> films ever made
<START> its a space flick or at least i think it is you got half naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to <UNK> humanity through sexy encounters its <UNK> hilarious the acting is so bad that space nuts looks like an emmy award winning film the story is simple space prisoner gets chance to <UNK> sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with humanity she finds a doctor <UNK> with women and a angry of alien she fights them so on and so forth its a movie worth seeing it just to wet your pants with laughter if you like real sci fi flicks its a no no but its a great mood <UNK> for the amateur film maker because i can guarantee their film is better than this
<START> wow this film was terrible it is as simple as that it is actually the first time that i walked out early as far as i can remember this turned out okay though i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a movie br br where to start bad acting bad jokes humour which i simply cannot stand sorry but <UNK> pee and <UNK> are not funny you have seen the title picture that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes with the two heroes hitting and <UNK> each other which is supposed to be humorous all by itself it is not br br apart from body <UNK> violence and cross dressing i do not remember much about this at least not much good i was really really disappointed by this piece of garbage or let us be honest here given that i am actually a big fan of british i e black humour i was angry br br so want my advice three words do not watch
<START> this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller but i was <UNK> all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a <UNK> thriller but that doesn't happen it runs slowly and <UNK> <UNK> the end with nothing interesting in it just the ending was unexpected and original but that's it vote 2 5 out of 10 oh one more thing why is this movie rated r anyway
<START> it seems that all companies that are enjoy with the <UNK> taken by romania for picture grant the image that disappear since 1994 they are hardly try to get the oldest car the had <UNK> but they never take pictures of the <UNK> <UNK> martin and all new <UNK> that are more the you can find in some important countries br br a second problem is that they filmed in some <UNK> in <UNK> where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put <UNK> on dressing people with i don't know maybe <UNK> clothes a making them seem so stupid that you will realize the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth br br i for future to keep making movies in us and to make good money there than to give us a little bit and shame our country i have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message beyond my english sorry
<START> talk about a bore <UNK> this 3rd rate biker film was putting me to sleep as soon as the opening credits came on the screen the shame is that the cast included many fine actors among them george kennedy karen black leo gordon richard lynch lance <UNK> and william forsythe br br a take off of the western classic high <UNK> this is basically the story of a former u s army green <UNK> <UNK> trying to get someone to help him rid a one horse town of a gang of creepy <UNK> br br everyone tries but the script is on grade school level sad to see academy award winner kennedy in such a <UNK> from his out standing performance in cool hand luke br br if you have trouble sleeping at night this would be a perfect movie video to rent you'll be sleeping in no time
<START> <UNK> zero stole my money and i want it back this is a horror movie not thriller not suspense a horror movie yes this movie is a horror <UNK> bad after many years of lurking here at imdb i am actually moved to set up an account just so i like at least one other reviewer here can warn people do not watch this movie it will steal your soul or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies this bad or at least an hour and a half of your life if you are not wise enough to hit the fast forward button br br seriously i'd love to hear the director's voice over on an enhanced dvd there's another horrifying thought to see what the hell they were thinking the producers had to assume there were enough <UNK> out there to fall for the val kilmer name to make this film at least break even in international distribution br br i actually had the misfortune to pick this to watch on movies on demand which provided no subtitles to the russian dialog not that it <UNK> much <UNK> to hear the russian translate it in your head if you can only to find out how dull it is just adds insult to injury br br i will give this movie a 1 because i cannot give it a lower rating and because it did achieve one remarkable thing it somehow made an almost entirely <UNK> movie not feel claustrophobic now that's a dubious achievement br br here's your spoiler and the ending holy mother no pun intended it's like they ran out of money and just decided to stop filming the climax of the film literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the <UNK> escape i have ever seen on film exercise your simple escape <UNK> too if you find yourself watching this the off button
<START> i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this so i was expecting at the very least a half way cheesy movie doesn't even deliver that there are so many problems with this flick that i don't even know where to start so i will list a couple of main issues once again spoiler warning just read them it'll save you the trouble of watching this later br br one this movie starts out with and often mentions the mythical <UNK> of both <UNK> noir a witch who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of and the mid or something like that an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with <UNK> and sells their <UNK> in <UNK> i liked that it was a cute concept anything to do with <UNK> is simply enjoyable but then you watch the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend and what was the deal with him was he psychic did he have powers why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called <UNK> didn't notice and them meeting their insane family not really insane they just argue a lot that's what most of this movie is arguing and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can't make heads or <UNK> of br br in one scene the main witch related character wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light it seemed rather important but absolutely nothing happened after she did it it just wasted more of my time br br and who the hell was that guy with his dog you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red eyed dog and then he finally gets there and gets killed what the hell was he the mid was his dog possessed did someone kill the dog they never really showed that also any scene involving the <UNK> was completely pointless and only served to <UNK> explain the lame ending it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere the boyfriend who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them the grandmother who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers but never used them the <UNK> who ok never mind there really was no point for his existence at all and then there was and her stupid <UNK> could she really do magic or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people this was a complete waste of time and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a is kinda cute and b it mentioned <UNK> save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don't even think about buying it unless wasting money is a new <UNK>
<START> a young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child both are disturbed about a two hour memory <UNK> on the night of conception interesting twist on an hackneyed story very good f x and interesting editing <UNK> is outstanding in a cast that features arnold <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and brad <UNK> <UNK> brings <UNK> to the outlandish kudos to director brian <UNK>
<START> this <UNK> eye special was <UNK> by complaints more on that later when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible sarah s law following the <UNK> and murder of school girl sarah payne in fact it s <UNK> was <UNK> while phil collins took legal advice after he found out he d been fooled by the show s maker chris morris into a starting a campaign entitled sense br br if truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but i do confess that i laughed out loud the edition <UNK> around and how society treats both them and their victims chris morris plays the <UNK> who tells the audience that an infamous <UNK> has been launched into space then <UNK> that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the <UNK> cue the child s frightened screams like i said very poor taste br br other highlights of the show include dr fox giving a scientific lecture that share an identical nervous system to <UNK> no one knows this but it s a scientific fact <UNK> <UNK> barbara <UNK> giving a public warning about equipment put on their <UNK> while surfing the net and kate <UNK> warning viewers that can send gas through the internet which makes young children to sexual <UNK> including one victim who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old colonel morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they re <UNK> as obscene the photos included <UNK> surrounded by a marital aids and a <UNK> photo featuring a young boys head a dog s body and an <UNK> penis that could only have <UNK> to john holmes hey i never said this show was <UNK> did i br br it s impossible to mention without the <UNK> fall out that surrounded it where politicians <UNK> <UNK> and policemen rushed to <UNK> the show for making fun of a very serious subject the show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it s a biting satire perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted <UNK> <UNK> to walk around the streets of britain before they <UNK> a mere tv show for tensions
<START> i find <UNK> documentary work to be very uneven <UNK> morgana a companion piece of sorts to lessons of darkness lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the <UNK> eye of an author it is by comparison amateur looking <UNK> pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any german tourist <UNK> with a <UNK> the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images wire <UNK> <UNK> buildings and <UNK> of dirt going through the lens in <UNK> order <UNK> with shots of sand <UNK> at one point <UNK> encounters a group of <UNK> cattle rotting away in the sand yet the image is presented much like you and me would perhaps worse the camera <UNK> hand held from one cattle to the next for a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast a hypnotic surreal <UNK> in <UNK> landscapes it lacks the visual <UNK> and conviction of a <UNK> author it's all over the place half hearted and tedious <UNK> creation <UNK> <UNK> in voice over then some other text <UNK> <UNK> for literature it's not until near the end that <UNK> morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters first with a man and a woman playing music in a room the man singing in a distorted voice through a <UNK> both of them <UNK> in their task a man holding up a turtle a group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground other than that this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual <UNK> to offer
<START> while i am a long time shatner fan since we used to watch trek re runs over the dinner hour in the early '70s i cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film whether for personal development or business reasons did he lose a bet br br as a movie fan i like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones but shoot or be shot doesn't have any flair or funny bits unintentional or not br br while <UNK> there were no <UNK> scenes blink or you'll miss it nudity cartoonish <UNK> violence with the endless bullet <UNK> so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the <UNK> required to get the mpaa to rate it this will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out br br of the eight people that were in the theatre with us four of them left mid way <UNK> statements like this is stupid br br shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter the examination board <UNK> his request insane he runs into a group of z grade <UNK> who shoot on video because its 80 cheaper than film and decides to force them to shoot his script at <UNK> there are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters but for the most part that is the whole movie br br if you want to spend 90 minutes on a shatner art film see free enterprise instead it is a much better film
<START> remember that friend in college who always insisted you rent the <UNK> movie possible this is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance br br i wish i could tell you exactly what sea of dust was about it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest he goes there to help but ends up being caught between two young women both of whom he seems to have a thing for but that's just scratching the surface this is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen and not nice thing people are constantly being whipped and stabbed there's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of the shining tom <UNK> is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore he's got a plan to take over the world by sharing jesus suffering br br on some level this is a movie about sex it's one without nudity which was a disappointment but there's no <UNK> the intent on another whole level it's a paradise unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected by the time the doctor travels through his <UNK> birth <UNK> to be <UNK> you'll just <UNK> it up to the crazy nature of the flick br br on the down side the film is pretty <UNK> some of the points are <UNK> home over and over if you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends this might prove an asset
<START> being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons br br i don't know why early 90's cartoons had something special i don't know if it was the <UNK> atmosphere a <UNK> change whatever but tiny <UNK> kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created br br the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers br br the characters were all funny and had the of not having a true lead character every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead
<START> this has to be the best movie of all time in my opinion it really taught me when i watched when i was 10 in 2000 that the freedom of a being a child slips away sooner then we expect it to also joseph has to be my favorite actor ever and i think that him and <UNK> wood did a great job in the roles of brothers this movie is quite sad and some people don't understand the ending but the story itself is quite incredible the thought of a poor 7 year boy bobby getting abused by drunken step father is horrible and what the two boys do about this is sad and important my favorite part of the movie is when tom hanks older mike lists the 7 things of being a kid that are lost to the <UNK> world however there are some parts that could have been done better in this movie such as the casting of the mother <UNK> who i think is a horrible actor the king played his role well since it is a hard role to play joseph and <UNK> definitely were the stars of the movie i couldn't believe how well they played victims of a <UNK> <UNK> being the age that they were 7 and 9 but overall i recommend this movie to anyone who loves great child actors and a great movie
<START> my original comment on this particular title was deleted by a imdb user or the staff only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film where's my freedom of word br br obviously this movie was made by students <UNK> so lame and amateurish it felt of course even they have to start from somewhere the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting with low budget and b class actors what can you expect there's some cgi in places so poor it looks like done with an old pc some may say this is sort of an alien clone only this time it's dracula in a vintage costume who's sucking the other cast dry one by one the sets are unconvincing cheap and small <UNK> rooms although the story takes place in a large space craft br br it would be fun to know what the stars erika <UNK> casper van <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> thought about the film after it was released <UNK> must be the worst <UNK> turned actor ever br br it was a total waste of my time and money don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick honestly i just hate this film with uwe <UNK> house of the dead dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever well i've seen even worse than these two br br avoid any other film will do better
<START> i did and i lost two and a half hours of my life that i can never regain again br br i honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie and that's not because i can't appreciate art i love a good film with profound messages brilliant cinematography and great directing br br this film just isn't one of them br br my main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow paced to the point of boring its audience to death on the other hand sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on my mother had mercy on me and explained everything before i watched it would it have killed them to hire a narrator at least for the beginning and the end br br let me break it down for you spoilers throughout br br for the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music waiting for the actual movie to begin br br for the following minute and a half you see several pictures of <UNK> and <UNK> landscapes like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times br br the next eleven minutes are occupied with the <UNK> monkeys they fight see the <UNK> fight some more <UNK> things with a bone supposedly they are <UNK> men whose evolution is being influenced by the singing not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book br br finally we get into space only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the blue <UNK> <UNK> a pretty quick <UNK> ed <UNK> as i understand yet here it feels absolutely <UNK> at last we get some <UNK> dialog and rather <UNK> exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon we are left to wonder about this for <UNK> more minutes of blue <UNK> and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti gravity br br next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and <UNK> at a space station we get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows then we're back outside traveling at a <UNK> pace over the moon a second <UNK> is revealed again filling our ears with that horrible <UNK> i had no idea that was an actual piece of music the <UNK> does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward br br seven minutes of watching the ship to <UNK> travel by this point in time my brains had turned into <UNK> could it be moving any slower maybe it's realistic to portray it as such but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism let me tell you about this realism thing i <UNK> when the secondary astronaut character died not because i'm a <UNK> and like watching people die but because after five minutes i was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing i'm supposed to care about this character feel when he dies instead i found myself waiting for <UNK> silence whatever way it came br br anyway now we get to the most interesting part of the film the part with hal forget dave the stick of wood protagonist the real star of the show is that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> villainous <UNK> <UNK> bad guy of a computer he's great and the open the <UNK> bay doors sequence is wonderful but it's too short and it's not long before the director once again <UNK> into too long goings on br br four minutes for hal to die and die he does slowly painfully losing intelligence with every minute voice getting lower and slower singing daisy daisy all with a low and constant <UNK> that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing br br seven minutes of flying colors as dave enters the <UNK> seven i could feel my brains melting and dripping out of my ears seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel again with that <UNK> cursed chorus we got the idea at the beginning of the sequence why drag it out so long unless he wanted to make <UNK> users go psychotic and have flashbacks br br i'm not even going to try to explain the ending mostly because i don't quite get it myself supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of <UNK> <UNK> space baby none of this comes across in the film for all you know it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever a lot of the movie felt that way br br the first time i tried watching this movie i gave up halfway through the second time i suffered through this sore excuse for a film it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted it's that boring br br call this crummy film art if you wish i wouldn't i've seen more interesting art in the local museum and i am never <UNK> myself to this kind of suffering ever again
<START> in another of the dreadful horror films i seem so <UNK> attracted to we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a <UNK> of zombies that <UNK> yellow blood and have very bad dental problems the first 45 minutes is all talk however and considering the young <UNK> cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to <UNK> <UNK> this is especially painful to sit through if you manage to stay awake through that nonsense things don't get any better with bad make up <UNK> and cheesy bargain basement not so special effects as for the conclusion well what's the <UNK> that the old <UNK> who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors a boy and a girl of course with his mystical powers please life is too short for these kind of movies <UNK> the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something you'll feel you've actually done something <UNK> with your life and you won't have put money into the <UNK> of studios who <UNK> out <UNK> rubbish such as this br br unfortunately it's already too late for me now where did i put that copy of 1 10
<START> released as king boxer in the u k br br this film was essentially the first kung fu film to go on general release in the u k many of us had through <UNK> astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit with somewhat restrained pacing all in all like through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be moving br br along come run run shaw and co with their widescreen home movie production values and astonishing <UNK> for parody dubbing and all the rules have changed king boxer was the first in through the door leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the <UNK> footsteps br br in spite of hokey plots <UNK> acting cheesy jump cuts and spaghetti western style snap stepped <UNK> this film was marvellous gorgeous without being <UNK> and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen we loved the sickening violence the anguish the <UNK> the martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating if flamboyant and <UNK> silly it was so very different from the japanese stuff we all knew and it had lovely <UNK> grace that perfectly <UNK> the sickening violence and <UNK> floors delightful br br the king <UNK> scene was at the time quite a <UNK> in schlock you cruel <UNK> my now it's rather less shocking but still a bit of a gut br br we didn't notice that any females in sight were absolutely one dimensional after seeing more films of the genre it now stands out like a sore thumb but at the time it didn't matter br br this film defined what would rapidly become the kung fu movie clichés all of them watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens there was no genre for it to <UNK> into it was unique and awesome it was the first kung fu movie and it still is for me and many others the best
<START> as a kid this movie scared me green as an adult i couldn't stop laughing br br i have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via mst3k i caught it instead on a late saturday afternoon when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters and there was nothing left to do outside but <UNK> some <UNK> leaves i figured this had to be better i was wrong br br the movie has some very good elements a water <UNK> a <UNK> painter couple of idiot ranch hands an elderly history buff and an evil wind um i mean evil head an evil head which will as soon as the <UNK> <UNK> of each and every one present is complete be looking for its evil body br br the whole story takes place on an evil ranch which apparently neither grows <UNK> nor raises evil <UNK> br br as everything is <UNK> by their resident <UNK> to be evil you either roll your eyes horribly or laugh <UNK> your sides split depending on your mood me i laughed until i had tears <UNK> down my face br br i remembered this movie <UNK> as one of those which really scared me as a kid but some kids are afraid of santa claus too no anyway if you're into 50's horror camp then this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss br br if you're looking for a good story line this movie has that it's the over the top <UNK> and downright innocence of the time that makes it so horrid the acting was just bad but it still had some good elements perhaps it rates a remake br br it rates a 4 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> for pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the <UNK> films i highly recommend each and every one of them
<START> this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with it works best early on as romantic comedy but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process by the last fifteen minutes or so the plot twists are just a series dramatic clichés br br the part with the airplane feels like some <UNK> footage from another film spliced in br br the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films
<START> great cult flick for <UNK> <UNK> types richard <UNK> is a mess bad hair <UNK> even his dark glasses aren't right about as good as a bad <UNK> flick can get actually that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was pretty cool maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one
<START> this film is worse than cat people which i saw during the same week it has all the 80's style mtv punk <UNK> the real ones who are anti social not todays pc commercial type frat boys and a bad guy called i really like and the film does that blue lighting 80's feel but the rest of it looks like low budget canadian i have seen so much of this while living in this great country and realize these type of movies were made because of tax breaks avoid at all costs
<START> i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say <UNK> 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all there are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think <UNK> 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs at least for me br br the biggest annoyance i had with <UNK> 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left wing politics i'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this volume really seems to <UNK> their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show <UNK> all conservative are horrible places <UNK> we need more gun control <UNK> school are under <UNK> <UNK> religious people are crazy bush is friends with the devil i could go on and this is just from the first three episodes br br sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just <UNK> your political views on other people
<START> i really enjoyed <UNK> seasons 1 3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it but i can't defend this nonsense spoilers follow br br the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis br br so if <UNK> thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a <UNK> would the <UNK> accept the <UNK> of his third most experienced officer would the <UNK> their <UNK> member the non elected <UNK> junior he has about three weeks political experience under his belt and is the son of a man they <UNK> would <UNK> send and <UNK> along with <UNK> leaving himself short of senior officers would <UNK> put a man into having sex with <UNK> prisoners in charge of the fleet br br i just don't buy any of this br br secondly while i accept there have been <UNK> and references to god up to the end of season 3 it's now all totally over the top i started watching <UNK> because i thought it was sci fi not some biblical epic i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the <UNK> developments in the series br br <UNK> was the best character in the show but he now seems to be totally insane not illogical considering what he's been through but very unsatisfying br br all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third <UNK> <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> this isn't good drama it's annoying and a writing cop out br br ok so what are the good points nice battle at the start of 4 1 some good dramatic scenes well acted when viewed in isolation a good final scene a nice <UNK> <UNK> ball of a development br br but this isn't sci fi it's turned into fantasy i can't imagine how the writers can recover this one
<START> i saw the <UNK> of <UNK> in london last week great acting by al pacino jeremy <UNK> joseph and <UNK> collins compare to other movies based on shakespeare's play this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow bravo to michael <UNK> for directing such top actors the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in <UNK> it gives the film and authentic flavor i had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters' anti <UNK> behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations
<START> who doesn't remember the muppet movie br br <UNK> the frog is now an american culture icon what child doesn't appeal to this character br br as the first actual muppet film the movie simply called the muppet movie did very well <UNK> takes a hollywood <UNK> advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad along the way he meets up with a pig a bear <UNK> a rock band and a few other quality puppets watch for dozens of cameo appearances like <UNK> steve martian richard <UNK> mel brooks and several more i grew up watching this movie and i loved it
<START> in the ring it was a <UNK> a website was the problem in <UNK> the danger in pulse came from computers and phone and one missed call guessed phones in stay alive the piece of technology that causes all manner of problems is an online game those who play it wind up dead soon afterwards how clever br br directed by william brent bell who and featuring an unimpressive cast of twenty somethings that you might have seen before but probably can't remember where or what the hell their names are this is an extremely derivative piece of film making aimed <UNK> at the pg 13 horror set seasoned scary film <UNK> will no doubt find stay alive extremely tedious highly predictable and not in the least bit frightening br br the poorly developed plot follows a group of <UNK> with extremely <UNK> names october <UNK> <UNK> and who attempt to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary <UNK> elizabeth who is killing anyone who <UNK> to play and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game to the end br br with a story as dumb as this viewers should expect a film with loose ends <UNK> not one <UNK> of logic who made the game how and why is never explained very little in the way of scares or gore and a dumb closing scene to leave the door open sequel
<START> based upon the novel the <UNK> by rea in essence the story's about the slow friendship that develops between an italian <UNK> <UNK> vincenzo sergio <UNK> who can be seen as the villainous king in prince and was the lead in <UNK> martha and a chinese <UNK> liu <UNK> <UNK> they set off actually on the wrong foot with the former <UNK> the latter for her inaccurate and slow <UNK> of what he wanted to tell a chinese <UNK> who had bought equipment that is <UNK> vincenzo wants to do the right thing which is rare in these days and that is to tell the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the faults as well as the <UNK> that their purchase would bring and given that he's disturbed by the fact that the deal still went ahead he takes time off to craft a <UNK> that would set things right br br but that also means to travel to china in search of the <UNK> machine which proves to be well hidden and seemingly having <UNK> without a trace with the initial reluctant help of liu they set off in this treasure hunt from city to city which brings us to lesser seen sights of china away from the and the to cities like with industrial like backdrops such as steel mills and nuclear plants with their smoke <UNK> the scenery the mighty river also makes an appearance along the way the usual <UNK> of such <UNK> <UNK> movies come into play such as the learning of culture ideals food and basically the understanding that the world is without strangers if only one makes an effort to try and connect while hints of some romance between the two leads are suggested it rarely made itself to be a <UNK> point until perhaps late in the movie hey <UNK> attract no br br besides the major industrial plants and <UNK> we get to see various <UNK> industry like working in sweat shop like <UNK> and i believe <UNK> too along with <UNK> making as a film it provided me the travelling opportunity without leaving my seat to observe and credit to it for not passing judgement from a moral high ground on exploitation and the likes and kudos too for the movie to engage in dialogue based on the characters' native <UNK> rather than and i shall not name names here some other movie cross cultural <UNK> where dialogue is forced dubbed and came off unnatural and truly <UNK> some might <UNK> the supporting characters to be too kind too always opening their arms and doors to a <UNK> but i would like to imagine that maybe in the more rural areas people in general tend to be more sincere friendly and basically not get caught up in the rat race to <UNK> on others or be <UNK> upon br br if there's a message to take away from the movie besides the fact that i mentioned that the world is without strangers is a reminder to myself that some of the stuff i <UNK> important may not be so to others importance is something one places upon something else and its basis really depends on how we define the boundaries we set so given our <UNK> lifetime i think i should <UNK> up a bit more live and let live and sometimes in the illusion that ignorance could be bliss
<START> this is the worst movie i've ever seen boring illogical terrible don't waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap i hope the directors won't make any other movie because this movie them the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors if we can use this word for these 2 guys they use only camera in hand many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen lots of scenes 80 of the movie are with conversation only there are movies like vampire vs zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad no point to making such movies please stop jason <UNK> and shannon don't make more movies
<START> this movie was thoroughly <UNK> unsettling and unsatisfying apart from a few nice shots of italy there's nothing to recommend this movie as usual hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a <UNK> existence the next guy you meet whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours he must be mr right as for humor there is some in the movie but i can't see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic comedy since about three quarters of the movie is totally depressing my recommendation skip it in the theaters wait till it comes out on dvd then skip it there also i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck drivel <UNK>
<START> i agree with andy this is a good movie kevin character is believable throughout the film we're forced to hate him and <UNK> with him paula <UNK> who plays <UNK> puts in a good performance too it's thought provoking and <UNK> without any <UNK> over production credit to director alison <UNK> and writer <UNK> for that a very worthwhile viewing the pace of the film is just right raising just enough interest in the subject matter to reel you in rather than <UNK> you with facts in a documentary style nice little soundtrack to go with the film too again used <UNK> not to distract you from storyline recommended
<START> i am a big <UNK> fan but i call it like i see it this film <UNK> along the plot was preposterous gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the the local <UNK> store come on tone <UNK> has the emotion of a wooden <UNK> <UNK> up the editing is choppy the actors and i use the term loosely sound as if they are reading their lines on <UNK> br br this movie could have been better <UNK> has potential but he chooses scripts that just scream stinker br br if you want to watch a good <UNK> movie may i suggest crash dive or <UNK> force if you have never seen one of his films this is not the one to introduce you to his work you will walk away with a bad taste in your mouth and think all of his projects are this bad
<START> i'd never walked out of a movie before this one i'd entertained the idea a couple of times but this time i did it <UNK> in to see the end of another movie but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends they told me i didn't miss much while i was gone either i was generally offended by the entire movie in such a grand way that i can't even describe it my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie the plot centered around the cruel actions of some <UNK> teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others there was no ray of light no or likeable person to provide contrast i found that even the good guys of the movie did nothing for me were silly stupid <UNK> or just plain <UNK> br br the <UNK> graphic suicide imagery was way overdone unnecessary and disgusting not in a i'm easily <UNK> out way but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way and besides the <UNK> of that scene in slow motion from so many angles the other visual aspects interesting camera work etc had potential but just became annoying sometimes i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them usually i can find some good things to <UNK> the not so good of any movie i'm not saying that this movie had nothing good but i am saying that whatever that may have been i can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad i'm really sorry about that too maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original
<START> the sea inside 2004 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lola mabel <UNK> joan <UNK> <UNK> jose maria <UNK> <UNK> nicolas <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br an inspiring tale of a living death <UNK> is superb br br the true life account of spanish <UNK> and his <UNK> to fulfill his desire for <UNK> by the right to die may not be considered a likely source of inspiration but this film is just that br br played superbly by <UNK> was a <UNK> energetic young man when he lost the function to his limbs after a tragic diving accident <UNK> <UNK> in flashback with a visceral <UNK> to the senses and for nearly thirty years lay <UNK> in bed while his loving family cared to his every need although his abilities to move were <UNK> his mind was very much active and proved <UNK> as an <UNK> poet author and artist that kept his mind busy until he could no longer bear the thought of living longer in his <UNK> condition br br enter beautiful yet also <UNK> with a <UNK> disease attorney julia the <UNK> who matches <UNK> beautifully as if they were indeed soul mates is hired to see through final wish to end his life and in turn becomes an <UNK> de camp when he begins to open up to her like to no one ever before not too long has time passed and julia begins to investigate her past discovering many letters hidden away by his family when julia confronts <UNK> with this he at first is reluctant to discuss any thing with her but eventually he agrees with her that this may help his case and the project becomes a book in the making  a <UNK> biography by way of free style poetry and <UNK> br br the film is a heartbreaking tale of the human spirit and how love eventually <UNK> over heart <UNK> in many forms including for <UNK> the unlikely love he shares with a complete stranger named <UNK> a single mother who sees him on tv one day inspiring her to <UNK> to his remote <UNK> in spain to get to know him and possibly change his mind about ending his life br br filmmaker <UNK> who co wrote with <UNK> <UNK> the fascinating screenplay allows some fantasy into the mix when <UNK> <UNK> himself magically leaving his bed and flying across the <UNK> landscapes to the eventual sea where he suffered so many years ago the cruel twist of fate that has imprisoned him for three decades the film is not a complete <UNK> with a sly wit and occasionally humorous tone throughout that doesn't <UNK> the impact of the story's final act kudos also to the remarkable make up job by james and jo allen do a tremendous job in aging the vibrant <UNK> to an aging man to full effect that should get them an <UNK> award nod br br <UNK> and deserve oscar nominations as two people with so much in common and despite julia being married to a loving <UNK> husband that a pair of people so made for one another it is down right impossible they were never together to begin with that's just one of the <UNK> that rings true but it is not by definition of the film as its whole it is a must see and one of the year's best
<START> d o a is an involving and entertaining little picture from start to finish dennis quaid is at his <UNK> best and quaid is sadly one of the most underused talents in hollywood his then beau meg ryan also appears with him but as is usually the case doesn't really make much of an impact br br the film is <UNK> directed throughout drawing on a number of influences to capture its feel would you credit that it's actually directed by two people the answer is no the whole thing is superbly slick from its innovative <UNK> to its <UNK> use of black and white photography all these elements help to keep proceedings fresh br br really the greatest thrill here is to be had with the dialogue it's snappy yet intricate doesn't waste a word and yet still manages to be entertaining the screenplay for this is like a pocket work of art br br this went <UNK> by me for ages before i finally caught it late at night if this is the first you've heard about it don't leave it like i did catch it soon it really is top notch br br if you're in the mood for a solid genre flick that manages to surprise at every turn this really fits the bill br br
<START> what an <UNK> this <UNK> do justice to the original with awful acting from everyone in this movie hitchcock must be spinning in his grave the where marion gets killed in the shower is just so <UNK> and unoriginal the only good bit is that they used the same music and its so obvious who kills her in the shower i rate this movie 3 10
<START> oliver stone always ready to make politically themed movies makes another one here talk radio is loosely based on the career of alan <UNK> a radio talk show host in denver who was murdered by white <UNK> in this case the character is barry eric <UNK> an <UNK> talk show host in dallas who loves nothing more than to <UNK> the people who call in as it is most of the people who call in are a bunch of <UNK> and things may be <UNK> up more than anyone realizes br br performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie i really liked the scene where he <UNK> at a redneck who calls in granted i wouldn't call this oliver <UNK> greatest movie ever but it's a good reference in an era when media gets more and more concentrated good performances by ellen greene and alec baldwin also help
<START> this movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named curtis killing people the other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge brown ugly glasses the actor probably <UNK> on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to revenge of the <UNK> br br another thing that i hate so much about this movie is that curtis takes his sweet time shooting people i kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice he sounded like he was <UNK> and not ten another thing i hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that br br then they put that annoying kid in the <UNK> and somehow he found a <UNK> in there that didn't make any sense and neither did the music the music didn't fit any of the scenes br br this movie is slow boring and a waste of time watch a different movie on your birthday
<START> if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen you are a better <UNK> than i br br count the logic <UNK> common sense leaps and credibility stretches <UNK> need more than two hands br br p s if one more film uses a location that is clearly <UNK> and claims that it is a different university in this movie's case berkeley i'm going to lose it
<START> the <UNK> for <UNK> project a slick looking film based around the <UNK> scene of the 1980's what we end up with is a film with identity issues the sub plots end up taking over from what viewers would assume to be the main plot so the focus on this film being mainly about <UNK> ends up being left in the <UNK> br br boxing depression self loathing gangsters <UNK> and drug deals are all <UNK> <UNK> into 90 odd minutes on no less than 4 occasions i had to check the run time of the film as the worry grew that this film was bound to disappoint br br what club scenes we do see are bland and repetitive featuring approximately 3 extras dancing in what is barely <UNK> as a club hardly capturing the vibe of the day br br if you're looking for a film about the 80's club scene something along the lines of what human traffic did for the late 90's forget <UNK>
<START> this movie was <UNK> obvious and predictable the scenes were poorly written and acted even worse following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines i would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies this movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the bachelor and <UNK> but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before the casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly as a note please don't watch this movie
<START> i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i <UNK> this movie the historical trial of <UNK> and the <UNK> de is a tragic and compelling story that i feel had the potential to be a fantastic film but failed br br although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film the badly written script and most of all the <UNK> <UNK> characters the worst of them were the children who were so over the top corny and <UNK> fake that it was almost painful to watch br br in conclusion this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed
<START> to start i'm not a person to rate movies that i haven't seen nor am i a person that rates movies <UNK> when they don't deserve it this movie was really that bad the basic plot was extremely formulaic and while it wasn't great the plot deserved about a 5 the part that really bothered me was anything <UNK> swimming in the film i <UNK> a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this film br br 1 no character development 2 no sense of time 3 completely inaccurate swimming scenes which include a a team of six <UNK> going to something called both <UNK> and <UNK> with no mention of how they qualify b this same team going to whatever the hell this meet was without swimming a real meet at any point in the film c the rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again d in the scene where <UNK> is <UNK> for a job the <UNK> show high school state wins and <UNK> at <UNK> yet the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 <UNK> depending on which of the 3 meets are happening e a team of 5 guys and a girl win <UNK> <UNK> whatever f said girl wins a men's 100 <UNK> event g in this race said girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 in the nation h the <UNK> changes a race from the 200 breast to the 100 breast back to the 200 again in the span on about 45 seconds i in the final <UNK> the which is being in a 50 <UNK> long course pool one <UNK> is seen doing two flip turns j in this same <UNK> the teams anchor <UNK> freaks out and steps off the <UNK> <UNK> an inspirational <UNK> talk which lasts for about two and a half minutes or about 3 times as long as the leg would take at a national caliber meet k the movie begins in the month of july or august assuming that <UNK> was <UNK> before the school year started and the pool was to be closed in 3 months so assuming these things both hold true the <UNK> went from not being able to swim to winning <UNK> <UNK> whatever in less than two as the pool had to be <UNK> and the kids didn't start practicing for a while l i'm sure there are a couple hundred more i'm just trying to block them out of my memory 4 throughout the film there is not a single mention of a <UNK> time 5 if you're going to have a movie about swimming it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well 6 the scene where the kid is kicked underwater is physically impossible br br that being said all the swimming scenes were way too slow <UNK> had horrible technique and the idea of being able to qualify for a national meet within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to <UNK> everywhere br br ok if you still don't believe me let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst films i have ever seen and this is coming from the guy that owns <UNK> soul plane <UNK> the hands of fate <UNK> and any number of other total piece of crap that have been put on film please don't go
<START> big fat liar is a great watch for kids of all ages even adults i had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under the laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too frankie is funny and marty <UNK> is hilarious overall a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time
<START> in trying to keep up with the <UNK> of youthful audiences as the 70s approached was the product of <UNK> and <UNK> material selected for here it's past life <UNK> <UNK> and therapy pretty <UNK> the real problem with the concept music or not are the extraordinarily low dramatic stakes just where can a movie go and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl he can't stand it can't go any place new but strangely it can't even go any place old indeed if it could audiences would still have no interest in the union of <UNK> <UNK> playing a much older arrogant french ass and streisand a much younger girl we never become invested in them their situations or <UNK> <UNK> is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his lyrics <UNK> br br it's all been given a shallow 60s <UNK> that makes it <UNK> <UNK> despite efforts here and there from <UNK> that are respectable it's not even adapted from a non musical story that met with any previous success that's just too <UNK> streisand occasionally has some funny business to offer as when she's trying not to fall asleep on her roof and <UNK> an energetic dance but she over relies on her <UNK> translation irritating <UNK> jewish girl <UNK> she can however sing very well at both the gentle and <UNK> ends of the range amidst a score of musical <UNK> she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs of much higher caliber than anything <UNK> or <UNK> had to offer <UNK> isn't <UNK> is a sweet <UNK> as sublime as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> funny valentine ' but the movie isn't able to realize any impact from it because the lyrics don't seem to be referring to anything in the movie and nothing remotely suggests a great love is <UNK> between and melinda br br the only cut we can view is a poor <UNK> job of a much bigger film strong research shows a longer better explained and more <UNK> but not necessarily a better film at http barbra <UNK> com films clear day streisand 2 <UNK> you can be sure there's be more <UNK> in that version but more importantly <UNK> be more thoughtful work from <UNK> br br in the end <UNK> sends <UNK> off to sing the title song after she discovers he's a total dick who <UNK> her a self <UNK> to allow himself off the hook and she takes the bait so uh <UNK> for that br br hurry it's lovely up here love with all the <UNK> he isn't you the title song
<START> horrible <UNK> drivel my neighbor brought this turkey over subjected me to it and didn't have the courtesy to apologize the plot was laughable my four year old could write a better movie
<START> at times i really when i look at the comments here it seems as if most people have seen a completely different film than i have i've just seen it and liked it not in the way that it made me happy but in the way of having seen a good film br br the film needs some patience yes and yes the main character is really annoying but that i'm sure is by intention br br maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this film in a cinema or at home most people watch films at home like they are listening to elevator music this movie definitely doesn't fit as background noise br br and no good directing doesn't mean having five laughs or explosions a second good directing means following your subject and keeping the story and actors together and while that doesn't work out perfectly at least i think it works quite good br br i liked the photography and sets even if they brink on the surreal at times the opening scene is really special br br i also liked the acting  <UNK> depardieu is not playing pierre he is acting the role of a pierre who is himself playing a role pierre is not the romantic hero that he so hard tries to be he is a <UNK> and self righteous idiot a downright <UNK> who by and by <UNK> all the people he claims to protect that even his love for truth is simply a pose is beautifully demonstrated by his ongoing lying and not even once asking questions or explaining himself br br people are wondering where this or that person came from and other stuff no character who is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained there is enough information scattered throughout the film on everyone br br and even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target practicing is seen remember that isabelle <UNK> from a war zone and obviously this is a <UNK> for fighters in a civil war most likely <UNK> which was still going on when the film was produced at least that's what is hinted at by the story isabelle tells pierre when she first meets him and by the later scene where pierre shows isabelle the book with his father on the cover which is surrounded by books on <UNK>
<START> this film had some very funny moments the aforementioned <UNK> sketch for starters br br the parts where tries to act <UNK> in front of his guests looking down at them through his nose very subtly done especially as the guest was a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> himself br br the scene where finds out that gina has a fiancé <UNK> she was <UNK> me along all the time the <UNK> <UNK> with his 2 candle eyes like as if she really <UNK> him but he believed it that's why it was so funny great moment br br gino was also excellent he should have been used more as the bad man where are the <UNK> i ordered he <UNK> brilliant stuff
<START> after getting hooked on the mini series north south i could hardly wait for the <UNK> north south ii then years later along came book iii heaven hell north south book iii finally the last installment came for the on going saga of the <UNK> and <UNK> families i was so <UNK> by this series that i taped each part off of tv and then managed to get family and friends hooked and i watched it again each time someone new wanted to see them my tapes are old and i <UNK> this trilogy on dvd if you missed book iii you didn't get full satisfaction and you don't know how it all turned out do yourself a favor and demand this set on dvd
<START> while out for water a young psychic woman named jessica burns <UNK> stumbles upon something else altogether she discovers a chest that has been buried for centuries on her <UNK> ranch instead of the treasure her aunt is hoping for the chest contains the head of <UNK> drew a devil <UNK> who was <UNK> by sir francis drake <UNK> controlling the hired hand who opened the chest <UNK> head goes on a murderous spree in search of the rest of his body  also buried on <UNK> <UNK> farm while jessica is certain she feels the presence of evil can she put a stop to <UNK> plans and will she be in time to prevent his becoming whole br br i thought i was fairly familiar with most of <UNK> horror <UNK> prior to 1960 but this is one universal film from the 50s that certainly gets little mention while the thing that couldn't die isn't what i would call a good movie it does have a few things going for it first the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious director will <UNK> whether by luck or intention is able to give the movie some nice atmosphere from time to time and the special effects involving the head are certainly creepy but the whole project is <UNK> by the acting i'm shocked to learn that any of the supposed actors in this thing ever appeared in anything else you would think that this was a one and done type of movie for most of those involved is the worst <UNK> she's horrible also the thing that couldn't die may have been a bit too ambitious for its own good given the budget and other limitations there was no way the movie could <UNK> to its more <UNK> ideas finally the movie ends rather abruptly just as things are starting to get interesting the end what's that about
<START> this movie brings back so many memories for me i was very young when it came out but i remember the first time i saw it my dad and i would always watch the ernest movies together we hadn't seen any of them in several years and i found a couple of them really cheap we watched them and could not stop laughing i love all of the ernest movies but this one is my favorite br br spoiler part br br the part i remember most is the <UNK> part my dad still does the electric chair scene br br end spoiler br br this is a very cheesy movie but a great one it's perfect for families it isn't like a lot of the trash out there but at the same time adults can laugh too if you like physical humor like facial expressions and the way people move then this is the movie for you
<START> honestly this short film sucks the <UNK> used in the <UNK> scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the <UNK> dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or <UNK> it if the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the <UNK> scenes in films like <UNK> and visitor q among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd it's not that shocking it's not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about <UNK> there should definitely be a bigger selection for us <UNK> the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching a <UNK> looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess on the other hand <UNK> sequel to aftermath now available as a double feature released by <UNK> films is an absolute masterpiece of a short film really showing what a good director really is when given the right material although i don't care for aftermath at all <UNK> is so well made that i will forgive and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future
<START> the series does not start as it means to go on although it's first two seasons are <UNK> with incredibly average episodes as well as numerous <UNK> afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born the first ever episode of star trek the next generation is remarkable for two things it's hugely enjoyable <UNK> to all of the main cast and <UNK> peculiar accent which would later disappear seeing how it all began is very satisfying and viewed in mind of the rest of the series rather moving actually otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q and some giant <UNK> that's right
<START> i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show <UNK> e g the weak joke the princess and the <UNK> isn't exactly shakespeare is it that had <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> i don't see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv <UNK> so this can be shown 4 5 days a week isn't there anything better than this
<START> if i had to pick the most depressing movie try to be suspenseful i've seen it'd be this one i know about how good the original is supposed to be it had better be better then this one the movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either i've seen depressing type movies that were saved because of the suspense to and the dark quality <UNK> didn't have that this was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie i think another imdb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way i completely agree i would recommend skipping this one maybe i'll watch the original some day but i doubt it i give this a 2 out of 10
<START> i don't understand why this movie was released it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your <UNK> <UNK> she bought in 1987 i am australian and work for a video store in the uk and thought that if an aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad boy was i wrong br br if anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film br br the picture was bad the sound was horrible and the acting oh the acting it was the worst acting in the history of film br br it makes me embarrassed and offended that they used the word <UNK> in the title because i am proud to be australian and this movie is seen in other countries and may give people the wrong idea br br please anyone who reads this and has seen this movie take the time to find other aussie movies to watch because you could choose any one of them and it would be better than that one br br i could have made a better film if i took a camera filmed my but for an hour ate the film waited for it to pass through my body then threw what came out at the television no <UNK> br br do not watch this film
<START> a guy with the unlikely name of shy walker looks for his two daughters in a <UNK> for an hour and a half that's the entire plot with across the board bad acting of course walker wanders around a corn <UNK> <UNK> i get it <UNK> not funny and yells girls where are you about 1000 times for some reason whenever he runs by a <UNK> a <UNK> sounding voice laughs as if the <UNK> is laughing at him yeah ok his daughters scream for most of the movie even when there is no reason to scream maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie twin girls straight out of 'the <UNK> show up every now and then most of the corn <UNK> looks the same so <UNK> search gets very old very quickly the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie even the music is repetitive so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast filming upside down <UNK> smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles using red lights to make the corn look scary and <UNK> the camera <UNK> degrees at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film making more often than not when walker is wandering through the <UNK> you can't see his face i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original <UNK> <UNK> which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a <UNK> don't be fooled by the r rating walker says the f word three times and now we have an r rated horror movie ugh the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back you know things are bad instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together <UNK> the end of the movie drags on and on and just in case it isn't slow enough there's some slow motion the last sound you hear besides your own laughter is very poor sound dubbing in case you can't tell this is the worst movie i've ever seen at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel
<START> many of the earlier comments are right on the money but some well not so much br br this is hardly a <UNK> movie it's well produced the live flying sequences are really superb and the model sequences are first rate it's no <UNK> br br is quite good in this and it makes a a nice companion piece for only angels have wings br br if you want to spot john wayne spot j <UNK> <UNK> first they end up together br br tom <UNK> is juvenile enough and somewhat dull but when they <UNK> him with the most pathetic <UNK> mustache in hollywood history it makes his character even less believable sally is much more so br br as for later influences this is <UNK> in the early <UNK> in distress zone the opening sequence of this film with the <UNK> <UNK> guy arriving at the grand central airport would have fit very nicely into the high and the mighty just imagine <UNK> <UNK> and a 1955 <UNK>
<START> even by the <UNK> standards of '80s slasher movies this one stinks the usual <UNK> of <UNK> teens heads for a forbidden part of forest which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor fast forward actually you'll want to fast forward through much of this mess to the present day where a couple of <UNK> are butchered the teens follow in their wake while a semi concerned park ranger a <UNK> jackie <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> a lot of time <UNK> his <UNK> succeed partially in <UNK> our attention from <UNK> of run of the mill nature footage padding finally more killings but nothing you haven't seen a <UNK> times before if you want to see the kids butchered <UNK> for <UNK> camp or the first friday the 13th over this
<START> i knew as soon as i saw the first trailer for black snake <UNK> that i would have to see it i was not disappointed in the slightest in the film which was written and directed by <UNK> and creator craig <UNK> it tells the story of a broken blues man and the <UNK> he aims to cure not just for her sake but also his own yet it's so much more than that it's complex and rich and it manages to <UNK> you in a gritty <UNK> <UNK> blue <UNK> without making you feel like you need a bath afterward br br the characters are for the most part <UNK> and very well written and performed the accents and the dialogue were carried off <UNK> however there was one weak link in the chain justin timberlake the best i can say for him is that he can pull off crying it's a rare male actor who can cry convincingly however <UNK> <UNK> was flat but as an actor he was trying very hard i would definitely give him another chance br br <UNK> and <UNK> samuel l jackson and christina <UNK> respectively have a great chemistry and a great respect for each other this is one of those films where it doesn't matter how good one actor is if the other one isn't up to the task and luckily both of the actors were up to the task br br the music was very bit as good as you would expect especially when mr samuel l jackson sings the blues phenomenal br br on the technical side all was brilliance as far as i could see it was well edited well shot and well mixed everything was great the character and set designs were just right the casting of the supporting characters even justin timberlake and especially kim richards was spot on loved it
<START> to quote one <UNK> review of the movie it started off slow and stopped the plot was <UNK> enough although some of the characters' actions seemed very very random the script was fairly well written in that the dialogue did not seem forced but everything went way too slowly there were too many pauses between lines and the way the lines were delivered was not all that great this movie had potential but blew it like a teenager turning to drugs my advice wait for it to come on tv before you see it
<START> <UNK> warning as many fellow imdb users already know i'm not a corny cheesy person if you don't want to read this kind of review then go br br to tell you the truth you're hearing this from a man who laughed through titanic and almost broke his parents' tape from continuously <UNK> the <UNK> scene br br spoilers br br one day i went off to the theatres with two friends to see <UNK> roberts former child star last year in august the boring trailers rolled on until one started off so <UNK> it was for radio the moment i saw the trailer i just had to see this movie on opening weekend when that weekend rolled along scary movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that friday night it turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie they went and also sold out good boy and radio i couldn't get a ticket and the following weeks i was busy with more important things about 5 months later my friend rented radio he let me borrow it and i watched it in my room i'll tell you this now this is the only movie i have ever seen that got me crying ever when <UNK> mother died it just came out automatically the next day i went off to blockbuster and bought the dvd br br well enough of my stupid personal story let me tell you about the movie br br cuba gooding jr stars as a mentally challenged man nick named radio ed harris co stars and this movie is directed by mike based on a true story radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone he goes around with a shopping <UNK> picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around he's got his own collection at the end of every day he goes home to his mother he never went to school until later in the film one day radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing a football flies over the fence and radio picks it up and continues on ed harris plays mr jones the football coach they meet and this is the life of radio br br throughout the whole movie radio and coach jones spend quality time together both teaching each other things it is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest <UNK> the lowest <UNK> and just seeing radio live his life you will laugh cry and live the life of radio with him this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others this is a must see for the whole family by yourself or if you're someone who just wants a great drama radio is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen radio will never be forgotten by me never br br as ed <UNK> character said greatly near the end of the movie br br we're not teaching radio radio is teaching us br br my rating 8 10 br br <UNK> a
<START> there are movies that are so bad they're good then there's movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful br br bad acting unlikable characters predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note br br i can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all i really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all it's 1 5 hours of your life that you will never get back br br 1 10
<START> i saw the reader at a film festival in manhattan this week it touched my heart in a way that few short films have done in ten or so minutes it tells a poignant two character story that <UNK> deeply with me <UNK> rogers has done a superb job capturing very real tender moments on film what i really admire about this film is that the director has chosen a story appropriate to the short format these are genuinely interesting characters and their story is told in the perfect length of time this is no small feat haven't we all seen shorts that are simply longer stories <UNK> to fit the format or stage stories that weren't properly adapted to screen i applaud the reader for really doing it right and i encourage anyone who is interested in film and in storytelling to look at it seriously worth every moment
<START> square really landed this one they didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on final fantasy 7 fans and boy are those going to be happy fans when they see this movie the story might not be all that interesting or credible but it ties in neatly with the story of the game and has several honest to god funny moments a total surprise there and a welcome one too br br there are lots of cameos and funny references to the game too and most important of all the fighting scenes rock so hard they could cut through diamond they are truly the total <UNK> and would have made the movie worth it even if everything else sucked i mean they are some of the best ever created period br br see this movie bye br br ps i know my review sounds like the <UNK> of a teenage girl it was like totally what i intended
<START> i thought i could see something good but i am tired after seeing this movie i don't know what i hated the most the script the acting the fx or the music try to picture the worst power rangers episode and would still be to kind i've seen better fx in <UNK> games the touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western i did liked how the women in the car was screaming when the monster was walking around the car even if she's looking in the wrong way so give your self a break and don't watch this thing at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you trust me you will end up playing <UNK> for some kicks
<START> this was <UNK> spoiler 1 protagonists avoid the pointless <UNK> of <UNK> truths to their loved ones <UNK> they surrender said status and assume the roles of <UNK> spoiler 2 the writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple <UNK> by the presents a threat to and <UNK> a response by the primary victim of the <UNK> spoiler 3 until the final 15 minutes i was <UNK> a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 instead it was kind of like discovering that lieutenant <UNK> dog is the real murderer the story just wasn't credible and i don't think the world's best director could have saved it without massive editing
<START> the movie contains a very short scene of <UNK> in a <UNK> she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age <UNK> but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless <UNK> script and the lead actress has none of <UNK> appeal the director apparently watched too many peter <UNK> films and x comes across as a <UNK> imitation of the <UNK> style without any of his inspiration
<START> if at all possible try to view all five of the universal mummy films in order not so much for the continuity between films but for the very evident lack thereof of course it goes without saying that the original boris karloff classic the mummy really shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called sequels all of which come off as campy or <UNK> br br this time around it's revealed that the <UNK> remains of princess <UNK> have made their way to the united states and once again as your eyes <UNK> you <UNK> the mummy didn't really die for the second time in the <UNK> tomb but is alive and searching for his lost love princess <UNK> with the help of the <UNK> nine <UNK> leaves during the cycle of the full moon to complete the mythology <UNK> needs a caretaker <UNK> filled by a <UNK> john carradine as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with the task by george <UNK> high priest of <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> are to be returned to their final <UNK> place in the hills of <UNK> in egypt but as we've seen before being <UNK> with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure with <UNK> character falling for the reincarnation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's shocking to see <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> one come to blows over the gorgeous br br <UNK> me this in both tomb and curse <UNK> <UNK> portrays the mummy with a limp right arm <UNK> <UNK> across his chest when he encounters the <UNK> he lifts her up in both arms with no problem as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to it's crippled position once again br br the ending of the film is most notable the monster gets the girl but it's a short lived victory as the mummy and his kidnapped bride <UNK> to a <UNK> grave an ancient egyptian curse is <UNK> the fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death
<START> there can be no worse criticism for a movie than the word boring br br some bad movies are lots of fun some fun movies are really bad but to be boring means no one will ever buy the dvd to watch it over and over again br br it appeared to be a movie that employed the drama class from the <UNK> they were all too busy running around to stay warm instead of acting the lead actor spoke is a near <UNK> <UNK> style voice damn it seemed that he was gonna seduce someone and he didn't care who br br the movie can't make money if it's boring i hope this one dies a swift never to be seen again death
<START> this unfortunately is a little known film i say unfortunately because it ranks up there with the classics of the american silent screen br br it's about a legend of a phantom <UNK> that all over the world picking up the souls of those who have died the legend says <UNK> the last person to die on new year's eve is condemned to drive the <UNK> for the next whole year br br it brings to mind the sequence of the ghost of future yet to come in <UNK> famous christmas carol br br the double exposure effects of the ghosts <UNK> when they interact with the live people are excellent br br if you love silent films you must see this it will blow you away br br norm <UNK> br br <UNK> old movie heaven http www com film film <UNK>
<START> there is nothing worse than science fiction crafted by folks who don't have a feel for it <UNK> at a concept which wouldn't be so terrible by itself a future where <UNK> is common enough that it is necessary to make it a crime for you to breed with someone too close to you <UNK> the screenwriter <UNK> to allow his ill suited imagination to run wild br br when tim <UNK> character was able to guess a security <UNK> computer <UNK> simply by getting her to tell him one thing about herself i knew i was in for trouble this ability was later revealed to be due to robbins having taken an empathy virus <UNK> being used to grant instant or nearly instant skill <UNK> to their users <UNK> love interest complained about her own experience with such a virus a <UNK> chinese language virus which allowed her to speak chinese but as she complained she couldn't understand what she was saying okay first off empathy no matter how intense isn't <UNK> without <UNK> some sort of true mind reading aspect like an empathy virus which <UNK> releases into the <UNK> <UNK> nearby people picks up bits of their memory then <UNK> for the original host which is as you can probably tell a <UNK> on the <UNK> side you can't justify being able to determine a specific detail like someone's <UNK> just by listening to the things you didn't say nor can you <UNK> the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying the virus can't <UNK> your vocal <UNK> and translate for you on the fly because a virus can't think to give you the power to speak chinese such a learning virus would have to <UNK> your brain it would have to <UNK> the knowledge among <UNK> and once it's in there it's yours you certainly understand what you're saying because you have to to use your own brain to perform a task you must understand that task for the most part unless of course they movie is suggesting that the virus was deliberately designed to put in place some bizarre multiple personality mental <UNK> where some sub <UNK> of yours functions as a built in one way <UNK> br br the of languages spoken by the characters is decent enough although nowhere near remarkable enough to warrant all the love other reviewers have given what's more all the <UNK> in the world can't make up for a simple frustrating fact the dialog stinks it's slow it's plodding and it's unnatural again i'm sure <UNK> have convinced themselves that the dull <UNK> is simply the result of an inspired genius creating a truly futuristic and therefore subjected to <UNK> drift form of speech i disagree good dialog is good dialog in any era and the same goes for tripe br br lastly i'll <UNK> the central concept of the movie the <UNK> of sex with yourself <UNK> <UNK> is a nice classic sci fi topic so is global warming leading to <UNK> <UNK> which code <UNK> also <UNK> unfortunately the two don't go together if you have an <UNK> disaster cutting down severely on the available living area you don't run around <UNK> people you have population problems enough as it is you don't add to them by <UNK> out re issues regular old fashioned sex and birth provides all the population you need and <UNK> of any sort would be <UNK> <UNK> br br to be fair the movie wasn't all bad it had some nice cinematography perhaps if i had watched it muted i could've enjoyed it
<START> while i am not a woman i can enjoy a chick flick if its good this one however is beyond bad you have the by the book story girl is getting divorced boy with issues shows up boom magic happens and his demons are <UNK> as she realizes her life has a new purpose br br now while i can believe that kind of thing might happen i am not an idiot it wouldn't happen over a weekend of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it would take time yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen i suppose a night of getting <UNK> and a night of <UNK> and <UNK> going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the <UNK> but most people don't br br now if that isn't enough the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting <UNK> with it by failed so how could they hit you again why i know lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice completely unreal but who cares br br so there you have it girl find boy boy find love death finds boy and mom cries what a movie not
<START> excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife <UNK> claire price as well of course as david <UNK> i did really figure out <UNK> but that is beside the point the ending which i won't <UNK> someone describes it on the board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested i found really sad despite agatha <UNK> reputation for writing cardboard characters i thought these really well rounded by and large br br the pacing of the story was good and i enjoyed seeing sarah miles as lucy and edward <UNK> <UNK> son i believe in addition to being a well known dr watson as her husband
<START> good lord br br i'm going to say right off the bat i only watched 20 minutes of this movie as i am a hardcore <UNK> fan the what you can't watch a <UNK> black and white movie with little to no dialogue defense does not apply i simply can't watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue br br this movie is what happens when you give an <UNK> <UNK> child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget and let him her put as much <UNK> offensive imagery on screen as possible it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long assuming it should exist at all shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes because the director has i just love the sound of my own voice syndrome and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed from the moment the girl in the mask started <UNK> the corpse of god the opening scene of the film joy i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around <UNK> on a rope by a gang of <UNK> mystery men i knew it was time to give up rarely do i give up on a movie i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2 book of shadows albeit not happily this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave it br br if you're an <UNK> fan do not let simple minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash allow me to refer you to <UNK> the iron man for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness
<START> for sci fans this will be better than anything likely to be running on tv at any given time that's about the best you can say of it good points <UNK> and sense of humour is less dull than usual in such movies the plot is coherent and doesn't use any magical mystical revelations bad points the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production <UNK> a rock <UNK> mole using rock <UNK> equipment breaks surface underwater with <UNK> a bubble or <UNK> <UNK> to be seen the characters are <UNK> and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard ok for a too tired to do anything else type evening but don't expect any major <UNK> or even talking points really
<START> drew barrymore gets second chance at high school on undercover assignment as newspaper reporter in flashbacks we see that the first time around was to put it mildly a major disaster david arquette is amusing in modest role as <UNK> brother who also <UNK> to help out <UNK> lots of subplots <UNK> but never <UNK> simple charm of movie drew keeps making her <UNK> as major innocent sexy light comic actress
<START> set in <UNK> in november 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign <UNK> who were trying to leave the country at the time of the <UNK> br br once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to <UNK> as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings he was <UNK> by the fact that his job had <UNK> him from his friends and enemies alike and he <UNK> for social contact br br robert <UNK> plays the quintessential stiff upper <UNK> <UNK> who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light hearted logical <UNK> on life while jason <UNK> has a stunning movie debut which <UNK> the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career deborah kerr as the leading lady <UNK> the grace and <UNK> we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character br br the film deals with a very <UNK> time in european history but it never <UNK> to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous <UNK> <UNK> that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and <UNK> makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together br br all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again 8 10
<START> after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some <UNK> of tv movies i should have followed my instincts br br i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn't the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is <UNK> at best and laughable at worst everything in this production is amateurish br br always a joy to watch mary <UNK> may be the only performer to escape this disaster without <UNK> her career or reputation i won't even bother checking the name of the leading man hopefully he's back doing commercials br br even poor vanessa redgrave whom i adore and respect seemed to be <UNK> <UNK> hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home maybe she needed the money br br if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel <UNK>
<START> <UNK> willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking this is because it was the first sound cartoon while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd <UNK> in <UNK> br br now if this were just an important historical film it would be worth seeing especially to lovers of animation however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is while mickey and <UNK> behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love thanks mostly to the <UNK> mind and talent of animator <UNK> there is an <UNK> charm about the film it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way clever and a real crowd <UNK> this film still ranks among best films even after 80 wonderful years
<START> spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves yeah it's really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know they're basically the same thing br br the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasn't really necessary he'd let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so they'd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and <UNK> by a zombie with a <UNK> stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a <UNK> and yes i hated it good day
<START> while it's not perfect it's close love barbara stanwyck sidney <UNK> dennis morgan robert <UNK> <UNK> police chief the <UNK> the <UNK> at restaurant felix and the judge i can go on and on this movie has been part of my family's holiday tradition since i was a <UNK> and my children grew up with it too the baby <UNK> the watch was always my son's favorite line br br sexy barbara stanwyck in pants and <UNK> stole the show along with the <UNK> funny s z dennis morgan has a few great songs too br br i highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake blah
<START> call it manipulative drivel if you will but i fell for it sure there could have been more character development yeah there could have been better cinematography and less of a constant movie of the week score but ed harris was impeccable cuba gooding adorable and touching and let's face it people in real life how many of us really get to know the motivation of others not many we did get a little glimpse into the <UNK> motivation a very provocative dialog in my opinion not to be soon forgotten so in my opinion this was a lovely tribute to one human being who broke out of his comfort zone to reach out to another human being and in the mean time touched the lives hundreds more a lesson we all need to me reminded of why is it that the right thing to do is so often the hardest thing to do i recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart you won't be disappointed and bring your <UNK> 8 10
<START> cant believe it after all these years finally <UNK> this down it was meant to be named 'the great at production stage i was living in oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming it was me that showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time i only realise now one was russell <UNK> it has taken me all these years to track this down was even unsure if it ever went to screen as i left oz the following month after wrap up party at that time russell <UNK> was not the <UNK> actor he is now and i had no idea it was him until i saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming amazing truly delighted with myself now
<START> i felt that way when i saw the episode in its original run and still agree when i watch it on reruns you had the <UNK> totally mocking columbo throughout the episode and treating him like he has down syndrome and in the end you see their shock when columbo gets them dead to rights and arrest them you also get a realistic reaction from the arrogant <UNK> killers they give columbo his props and say he just got lucky i like the formula where there is an elaborate crime the killer s totally <UNK> columbo and then you get their realization that columbo was totally playing the criminals i recall in the first few episodes of the post 1989 episodes they weren't following that formula and this was the first episode that i was pleased with
<START> pointless and pretty silly film that is just basically a <UNK> of clips from horror science fiction and suspense films there are unnecessary shots to an audience watching the clips and donald <UNK> and nancy allen are among audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror films not a bad idea but all the explanations are obvious movie horror helps us deal with real horror you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theatre and pretty trite also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of jarring and shown out of context these bits aren't very scary at all and it's real short i saw it in a theatre back in 1984 and was <UNK> that i paid 5 00 for an <UNK> minute movie br br still it is reasonably well edited and allen and <UNK> seem to be enjoying themselves for people who have an interest in knowing more about terror this might be fun and interesting but if you're a horror fan like me you'll probably be bored silly good idea bad execution no pun intended i give it a 3
<START> just exactly how director john <UNK> come to settle with nicolas cage and penelope <UNK> playing the roles of an italian officer and a greek <UNK> in an <UNK> story captain <UNK> just escapes me witness a <UNK> inconsistent accent by cage amid horrendous over acting with <UNK> more adequately cast as a spoiled latino opposite johnny <UNK> in blow in basically a repeat performance under the <UNK> of a greek nurse it was painful but there were saving <UNK> br br the story itself is thrilling to tragic and cage does have some redeeming this is musical ability next a superb performance by john hurt father the village doctor of oscar as well as by irene <UNK> each as village <UNK> as well as by christian <UNK> son among the village freedom fighters go far towards counter <UNK> awkward performances especially at the beginning by <UNK> and cage nicely the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses but it´s teeth <UNK> early on finally the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award and such provides pleasant <UNK> when most needed br br john hurt already has two oscar nominations and this would be a third i hope he gets it as his performance as the doctor makes this film worth seeing the true test of a supporting actor actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the <UNK> in question and in this case it would most certainly not be not even close br br entertainment value but for the <UNK> plus factors which do help raise the bar see it if you <UNK> rating 3 5 stars of five
<START> i can't believe this terrible film was made by the same people who made gore watch that and skip this the plot is muddled and the characters are mostly two dimensional stereotypes i suspect the editor went on vacation halfway through the film because quick choppy cuts start to appear that only confuse matters rather than <UNK> them the ending doesn't make sense either br br this is <UNK> a propaganda film made so <UNK> can feel sorry for themselves and <UNK> america for the <UNK> <UNK> of 1999 they do this by <UNK> lies about <UNK> being our allies during wwii claiming the whole world is <UNK> against them and completely ignoring everything said and done by <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> war on three <UNK> countries they seem intent on making a political film but only show a few seconds of <UNK> on a tv screen with no sound a <UNK> agenda obviously any consideration of art which was not the case with br br <UNK> i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival he also <UNK> the bad editing and confusing plot and i had to apologize for the bad advice you've been warned
<START> i must have seen a different version than the first person on the user comments section br br it's really really good steve and karl urban are great together val <UNK> character is much like he was in the novel although the emphasis is on gus and call and the we get to see what happened with call and mother as well i won't spoil it but it gives a lot of insight into <UNK> character br br all the actors did a really convincing job steve had the biggest challenge i thought to follow robert duvall there's a lot of action humor tragedy it's got something for everyone i can't wait until it <UNK> my family are all jealous i got to see it early
<START> you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal in this case a little dog is the best actor on the screen the acting in this film is so bad so amateurish by dog got embarrassed watching this he rusty our golden could have done a better job than the people in here br br by now this is almost a trite story kid finds animal pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the pet winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family sound familiar br br i remember this movie being a big hit but never got around to seeing it until the mid <UNK> on vhs i was shocked how bad it was why so much fuss over a film was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd possibly there wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are <UNK> for cute little animal stories who could resist this cute little dog not me but the movie i can resist it's a grade b storyline with horrible acting br br recommended only for small dog animal lovers and i mean lovers because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day and age
<START> i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i've been to the scottish <UNK> and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can <UNK> some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le <UNK> combat there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute <UNK>
<START> apparently this australian film based on novel exists in more than one form beware heavily cut versions sometimes shown on cable or satellite running anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours only the full 5 hour miniseries version tells the story properly it is a very close <UNK> of the story suffering only from <UNK> faults <UNK> found in tv movies and episodic progression but this excellent cast carries the story forward very well with generally good production values accompanying their work <UNK> is notable as <UNK> one of the guards assigned to <UNK> the women on their <UNK> trek in the end he becomes a friend you will <UNK> with him when his loss of face leads him into death helen morse as jean <UNK> pretty but not a great beauty she resembles <UNK> weaver a bit <UNK> just the right amount of <UNK> and as the occasion demands the miniseries properly <UNK> the beautiful love stories three of them joe and jean <UNK> and jean and jean and gordon jackson plays <UNK> <UNK> but as a somewhat younger man than <UNK> in the novel the third love affair i mentioned doesn't get quite the emphasis it is due and the full significance of the title is <UNK> jean is devoted to the goal of bringing <UNK> to that will attract young women and girls and their influence to this god <UNK> out back town she wants to make it a town like alice alice springs that is we get only a few hints of this in several scenes if you have the five hours to spare this miniseries is a truly rewarding experience based his novel about the cruelty of the japanese military in a large group of women and children from one place to another on the <UNK> on a true <UNK> it happened on <UNK> according to though rather than on the <UNK> the <UNK> of joe by a japanese officer for stealing <UNK> to feed the women is probably fiction but the cruelty of the japanese in dealing with prisoners is certainly a matter of record
<START> i happened to catch this on community tv a few years back and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable a film it was br br while a bit corny in certain ways as its prime function of being a mystery thriller it works superbly thanks to a script that <UNK> an ingenious plot it kept me guessing throughout and the resolution is inspired br br the cast is a star <UNK> one containing a mixture of those at the end of their careers indeed richard long died the same year this was made or those who were on the verge of stardom in hit tv series kate jackson tom <UNK> they all do a good job with the exception of <UNK> who <UNK> through his role br br strongly recommended
<START> this movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long long while to be fair i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula but i was <UNK> to at least be entertained with such low expectations how could i manage to be disappointed br br jim carrey possibly my favorite actor not sarcasm did little more than <UNK> water in this film he seems to have <UNK> returned to his funny face making roots and created a character no different from his <UNK> from liar liar this new character dick <UNK> a k a <UNK> 2 0 is a poorly rendered and miserably written if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him <UNK> outlandish posing becomes <UNK> awkward and ultimately sad br br tea <UNK> as jane does little more than provide the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> i typically find tea <UNK> refreshing and underused but not in this case jane <UNK> could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty five and it is in that non <UNK> that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch she simply has no defining <UNK> other than her following of the movie's general theme which seems to be that wait no this movie has no theme unless you count big business is evil as a theme i thought that was more of a given br br richard <UNK> and alec baldwin both deliver believable though tired supporting performances but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c e o as he puts into eating a <UNK> which he seems to be doing a lot of lately br br slight <UNK> but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit br br anyway take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself save your money this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months dick and jane are present but there's no fun to be had
<START> this is probably the second best of the death wish movies death wish 5 is the best one br br death wish 3 reminds me of west side story with a new twist not even the recent flick gangs of new york can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs but one big gang a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an <UNK> if he <UNK> on its set br br deborah <UNK> who plays a public <UNK> plays gently in this action packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot em up violence so like <UNK> in death wish ii death wish iii scores with its gentle romantic moments as well as its violent moments only the james bond love interest scenes would do much better br br and in addition to his <UNK> plays with this new gun called the <UNK> <UNK> it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> force sudden impact and dirty harry the gun packs a big punch and when kills with it he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it br br and that missile that killed off the main gang leader well that is something would not use an missile as his regular vigilante weapon that is way too military for him
<START> the reader is a perfect example of what a short film should be a poignant story told simply through well written dialog beautifully painted images a score that <UNK> weaves it's way through the narrative and characters portrayed with <UNK> and grace br br i saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were screened but none of the other shorts had all the elements of great film making coming together in one film as the reader did the reader <UNK> the attention of every festival goer in the room and for 10 minutes took us into the emotional lives of the characters br br <UNK> rogers has created a beautiful film and i hope to see more from this director be it more shorts or perhaps a feature length film
<START> i personally love this film amidst the halloween series i've found after watching it with many friends that you enjoy it completely or find it absolutely unbearable personally i've watched it dozens of times and it never gets old there is a great back story within the movie itself and a lot of different things are finally explained it's a rather short movie at just shy of 90 minutes but it's definitely a thrill ride br br the shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film but the acting is still there with the way he walks stalks and kills there are a lot of neat little screen shots with micheal appearing in the background which adds more of a spooky element to the movie
<START> this movie is awful i'm sorry i bought this to get star worms and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms oh just kidding turns out this is the worst movie i've ever seen the acting is garbage not that there really is any and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like stuff or something i can't really tell the special effects are so bad that you can't even see the <UNK> dinosaurs which by the way do not war but just stand and kind of move their mouths or whatever those things are the movie is a headache it's very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe really this movie is just <UNK> even by <UNK> standards the only good thing i can say about it is that it's got a lloyd kaufman intro as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn't fit for <UNK>
<START> and <UNK> is an outstanding production of george <UNK> masterpiece it is <UNK> done in muted colors the voices are outstanding although sidney voice is dubbed for his singing portion he gives a very touching performance there is a remarkable performance by sammy davis jr as life there is yet no dvd available for viewing and this piece begs for one all intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium the screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by <UNK> and <UNK> be sure to ask for it an your video <UNK> like songs of the south by walt disney it may be the <UNK> of racial overtones that is <UNK> the marketing of this cinema
<START> attend the tale of <UNK> todd the strangest most off putting but most wonderful broadway musical it is chilling funny and moving all at once through <UNK> most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances george is <UNK> in the title role bringing a strong voice and dead on no pun intended <UNK> of the legendary demon <UNK> while angela lansbury provides the comic relief as she <UNK> <UNK> up his victims into meat <UNK> if you just allow yourself to enjoy it <UNK> todd is a real treat
<START> i decided to watch this ultra low budget film from the poverty row studio <UNK> because it co starred the exciting character actor lionel i really liked the title even though <UNK> often played in these cheap movies his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better as his screen persona was great his real life is also quite of like a bizarre soap opera the reason i use the term poverty row is that this was a <UNK> given to the very <UNK> and worst production companies of the era many of these weren't even real studios but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night yes there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working common thing for such studios br br the story begins with lionel <UNK> telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago a doctor falls in love with a lady but he's afraid to tell her about himself that's because his job is putting people to death on death exactly a <UNK> job the doc asks his friend <UNK> for advice on how to break it to her but regardless she won't have the man later you realize it's because her own parents were criminals br br later a man is killed and the lady is it's obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved and is a bit of a nut and the evidence against the lady was poor but apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution don't you think someone else might just be able to handle this case until this <UNK> hour her friend <UNK> spends much of the film trying to prove her prove that the <UNK> sister knows far more about the case than she'll admit br br overall the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly while it is watchable and <UNK> is good as usual the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty <UNK> it's sub par and about what you'd expect from such a low budget nothing more despite the cool title
<START> in london the <UNK> carla <UNK> is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend <UNK> she meets the lesbian real estate agent <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a large apartment when the jealous <UNK> finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with <UNK> and <UNK> with an <UNK> in a party when <UNK> comes to london he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior br br is another soft porn of the sick director <UNK> with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful in every possible angle and her character is abused touched and <UNK> in every part of her nice body but without showing explicit <UNK> this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a <UNK> experience seeing naked in erotic situations my vote is four br br title brazil a the <UNK>
<START> i'll <UNK> with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies they are too numerous to name a much shorter list would be what they got right 1 dude named <UNK> 2 <UNK> with animals on it br br if you want a much more accurate portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> and the destruction of go rent the bible 1966 it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son <UNK> it's a much better movie and it may be that the abomination called <UNK> <UNK> 1999 drove you to seek just such a film http www imdb com title br br i really couldn't stomach watching the whole movie from reading other comments i can see that even the <UNK> found it grossly inaccurate as a christian it was <UNK> to me possibly the worst movie ever made no real point to this movie either except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation br br was it a complete waste maybe not god can use evil to work good br br <UNK> 8 28 says 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose br br <UNK> 50 says 20 but as for you <UNK> thought evil against me but god meant it <UNK> good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive br br in the second example <UNK> brothers meant to kill him but god turned their evil into a very great good he may have done the same thing with this movie br br people were so <UNK> by its lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves to find out about lot and they would have to go the whole way up to <UNK> 19 before god destroys and <UNK> by then they have read almost half of <UNK> so they might want to finish the next book is <UNK> which the movie the ten <UNK> was based on and much more accurately if they have seen that movie then <UNK> becomes an easy read so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about <UNK> <UNK> i'm sure this actually happened to someone out there br br god works in mysterious ways
<START> i finally received my dvd today viewed it and i'm pleased to <UNK> this is the original theatrical version of the film as you may have read in previous reviews of rich and famous that the edited for tv version of the film that somehow made it onto vhs sometime in the late 90's but now wb has <UNK> the error and released it on dvd complete with the airplane <UNK> scene matt bare butt and the scene in the hotel room where liz <UNK> <UNK> calls merry <UNK> <UNK> a c t it's all there and looks better than ever a crisp clear digital transfer widescreen and special features that include original theatrical trailer and a vintage 1981 <UNK> called on location with rich and famous with cast and director interviews if you love this film as i do you won't be disappointed with <UNK> this dvd glad to finally have this on <UNK> well worth the wait thank you warner bros
<START> thats what this movie really takes a big piece of <UNK> this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them but for what reason just for the fun of getting away with it in comes richard <UNK> who comes across as a <UNK> <UNK> ladies man a real bad version of a ladies man and he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across la he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with <UNK> dressed in his mothers wedding <UNK> acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can't live without her and watching as she <UNK> him across the face him i can't believe that was well i guess i could but it's worth watching but only to see one of worst films that he ever did
<START> while on vacation on northern australia <UNK> diana glenn her husband adam andy and her younger sister lee decide to take the <UNK> barry tour in the swamp for fishing their guide jim ben uses a small <UNK> boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot when they stop they are attacked by a huge crocodile that their boat and immediately kills jim the three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them they decide to try to find a way out of their <UNK> location however in the <UNK> water their boat is <UNK> and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water br br black water is a tense realistic and dramatic low budget movie and in <UNK> with the warning in the beginning based on a true event the acting of the unknown diana glenn and andy is top notch giving credibility to this simple but scary story there are many similarities between this movie and prey but in different <UNK> my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> deep fear
<START> as i said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential i was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical american mass movie we are in this for the money if only the producers had had more time to actually make the movie this one was not finished when they let it out
<START> at last a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy willis is great as always rusty was delightful just enough action to keep interest going
<START> i feel <UNK> to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was <UNK> another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bates who has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a <UNK> mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of <UNK> her family martin sheen is superb as the tough <UNK> who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a must see for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your <UNK> like none other
<START> fame i think was the best movie that i have ever seen in ways it was funny and dramatic but that is what makes a movie true it has a few loose ends actually a lot but i still think that it is a terrific movie some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie i think it is hilarious when the girl tries to act out o j simpson in the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ralph goes around to every art department saying that his father was great at every one he says that his dad <UNK> with the rockets and left ralph his tap shoes the rockets as far as i know are made up of women and the tap shoes were just regular shoes with bottle <UNK> on the bottom also the guy who read the lines of juliet in the romeo and juliet play was funny one thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music i have never heard anything like it my favorite song is i sing the body electric and my second is the theme song itself fame irene <UNK> has a great voice and is a great actress i like the way the movie focused on many ethnic groups it showed all of the kinds of people there actually are in what is now called la school of the performing arts this movie showed the <UNK> and trials of many young performers including <UNK> doris bruno <UNK> <UNK> ralph <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they all had a hard time but made it their own way this movie could have added on about another 30 45 minutes before the <UNK> but it is still my favorite movie no matter what
<START> jean gets <UNK> mannerisms down pat the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> when entering a club as all the women turn to admire him the <UNK> <UNK> and down of the tie the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it's uncanny and you come to realise just how much of bond in the sixties was <UNK> creation and not really ian <UNK> character br br the cinematography is a nod to those early films the movie takes off from russia with love and <UNK> mainly the main joke is how <UNK> the hero is not just in terms of <UNK> but <UNK> and <UNK> and how he puts <UNK> out of joint when he is sent to egypt br br it's not perfect about 20 mins in it seems a one joke movie and bits of it remind one of spoofs of the day of which there were plenty and <UNK> the intelligence men had suspect looking men in following their heroes around too and that's going back a bit unlike <UNK> <UNK> or baron <UNK> <UNK> doesn't give his character that <UNK> of <UNK> or genuine pathos he is too busy <UNK> his connery mannerisms it doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song and there's no funny or serious villain like mike <UNK> dr evil or <UNK> naked gun nemesis for the hero to go up against br br but the scene where wakes up in <UNK> one morning had me laughing out loud in the three quarters empty cinema and the whole thing looks wonderful plus you'll never get a chance to see operation kid brother on the screen and the women are ace <UNK> really hot it's a bond spoof without falling into the mad scientist ken adam sets or funny <UNK> routine <UNK> recommended
<START> i enjoy science fiction just as much as the next <UNK> but what the hell was that apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film <UNK> ' this jean <UNK> short is a <UNK> futuristic satire produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero in the year following a great war africa has become the most <UNK> region on earth and what was <UNK> europe has been <UNK> unknown land an african <UNK>  played by johnny <UNK> a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man if you follow me  travels to the ruins of paris in his aircraft and lands outside the <UNK> of a <UNK> savage catherine <UNK> then the director's wife and her <UNK> companion perhaps the <UNK> ape man costume i've ever seen the savage as part of some bizarre sexual <UNK> ritual starts showing the <UNK> the <UNK> dance which he is delighted to learn himself br br it doesn't help the film that <UNK> who was wonderful the following year in <UNK> 'the little match girl <UNK> ' isn't much of a dancer though the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of <UNK> to the ceremony furthermore i'm quite shocked that <UNK> would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later on the plus side i did like the general sci fi concept behind the film and the <UNK> <UNK> touch of the <UNK> the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this however why <UNK> decided to dress up his black actor as a <UNK> will remain a mystery for all of time silly crude and quite pointless parade <UNK> ' is a cinematic <UNK> from one of <UNK> most respected directors and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack but i <UNK> with a selection of pieces from <UNK>
<START> eric phillips don wilson is a secret service agent who <UNK> the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a <UNK> on his tail the <UNK> by the way is bent on <UNK> phillips the most obvious inspiration for this low budget <UNK> action flick is of course <UNK> and while that film had some imagination and real energy this just has a real life <UNK> <UNK> running away from a robot the movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive the story is written in clichés and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various <UNK> don wilson as usual is terrible in the lead role br br 1 2 out of 4 poor
<START> i watched x because scott walker composed the film score and i admire his music a lot frankly i expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent french movie i was wrong the vision of the film quickly managed to engage my attention to the <UNK> starting with the opening sequence which shows black and white footage of military <UNK> throwing bombs at graves at the sounds of music and scott <UNK> beautiful <UNK> voice the film explores the identity crisis of pierre <UNK> depardieu a brilliant choice for the role and his <UNK> self destruction the story is divided into two parts  the first depicts <UNK> life in a beautiful house in the french countryside and the second follows his utter personal <UNK> after he <UNK> everything and moves to paris to live in <UNK> with his supposed half sister both parts contain some amazingly stunning photography  the first very colorful and bright the second utterly gloomy and nearly apocalyptic adding up to a true aesthetic feast x is a fascinating and quite unique movie experience
<START> the italian job is a real blast to watch it's a genuinely entertaining film something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it it's not heavy with drama or emotional hand <UNK> it has no <UNK> statements about life and it's not violent or <UNK> it's just a fun movie between watching the little mini <UNK> fly around the crowded streets of l a and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek turned crook played <UNK> by seth greene i had a lot of fun watching this film br br special kudos to the background music they truly set a masterful tone for such a movie so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music i found it to be the <UNK> part of the film br br 8 out of 10 not awe inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office br br <UNK>
<START> i found parts of this movie rather slow especially the first part the second part seemed to go a lot faster but it's not totally clear to me as to why one part was faster than the other i somehow managed to find it enjoyable the acting was good the writing was good yet vulgar there was also another good side to it it was easier to understand than say the godfather movies you knew who was on whose side etc all in all the movie wasn't half bad
<START> i was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of <UNK> let me just tell you from just the previews i was excited to see it the movie absolutely <UNK> what i really liked about it was the fact that <UNK> was in his element with other movies like school of rock he does <UNK> <UNK> music for kids and families but this music is obviously all his br br i took my brother and sister with me to see it and we laughed basically the entire time there are a couple places where i wonder what the hell they were thinking because some items are a little disjointed but for the most part it was great a lot of the time it didn't seem like a low budget film so that is a plus br br what i was most surprised about was dave as satan that is f ing hilarious you honestly wouldn't know from seeing the film that that is him br br i say that if you are a rock fan and are into <UNK> and or <UNK> d go see the film be prepared for a lot of drug references a lot of four letter words and some skull <UNK> rock
<START> based on an actual story john <UNK> shows the struggle of an american doctor whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss a holiday to <UNK> with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all but when her <UNK> was stolen in she could not leave the country with her sister and was forced to stay back until she could get i d papers from the american <UNK> to fill in a day before she could fly out she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide i tried finding something in those stone <UNK> but nothing <UNK> in me i was stone myself br br suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt just when it looked like she had escaped and safely <UNK> a train she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him with no thought of herself continually her life was in danger br br here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous <UNK> charity <UNK> her life to save another patricia arquette is beautiful and not just to look at she has a beautiful heart this is an unforgettable story br br we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps
<START> this movie coming from turkey where you can't find any tradition of horror movies first i was afraid of watching just an adaptation but after seeing it i have changed my mind it has original scenario a love movie using horror <UNK> most of the players are not famous young people but their performance is that a new generation is coming maybe this is a sign that turkish cinema is coming back after 20 years
<START> there are other reviews here expressing similar views but i still feel <UNK> to add my comments the film is generally well made from a technical point of view apart from possibly being too long the acting is mostly very good although kevin spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation apparently ambition rather than racism and sandra <UNK> only function seems to be as eye candy which she admittedly manages very well br br at a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism and i get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it however it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew i haven't read the book so i don't know how much of that is down to <UNK> the biggest problem as many others have said is that it ends up <UNK> vigilante justice aside from the fact that i don't agree with that position i don't think that such a view actually helps the anti racist cause at all it's more likely to be applied to <UNK> white <UNK> who kill black victims at the end the <UNK> invites the jury and the audience to imagine that the raped girl was white but follow that through and imagine the <UNK> to be a white man who murdered black <UNK> in the end the message seems to be that it's ok to kill someone as long as you hate them enough it's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt which <UNK> any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case br br samuel l jackson gives an excellent performance but unfortunately this also <UNK> the plot he comes across as someone with considerable integrity but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity <UNK> and indeed he doesn't when push comes to <UNK> we're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty but in fact at one point he's offered a <UNK> of <UNK> although if you blink you might miss it why not take it given that he must know his chances of <UNK> are slim or if he wants to make a stand in court why <UNK> insanity br br there are less serious flaws too the medical experts on whose <UNK> the case supposedly rests are jokes both are <UNK> for highly implausible reasons and neither of them offers any real psychiatric <UNK> the message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say and shouldn't be believed the fact that the injured policeman supports jackson is moderately plausible but still a bit convenient and what if he had died i find it hard to believe that the <UNK> would march down the street in broad daylight other apparently serious crimes riot <UNK> kidnapping attempted murder go by without any visible attempt to <UNK> or <UNK> them and the scene where the dog comes <UNK> back is ludicrous br br my final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty as though i must be a racist because i disagree with the resolution it may be that the film intended to explore different <UNK> and leave the audience to decide but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end the film did make me think about my views read what other people thought here and add my own opinion so at some level maybe it succeeded but i worry that it may have re highly views in some people which i hope is the opposite of what it intended br br final thought try watching law and order it covers issues like this with much more depth in about <UNK> minutes of screen time
<START> this is not a good movie at all i cannot believe that after fifty years this movie gets the national award when there have been such gems from <UNK> cinema that have been so <UNK> ignored this is a very overrated movie that got very very lucky it was given the national award <UNK> the popular opinion and now is going to represent india before the international audience anyone with even a <UNK> understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the oscars br br i cannot understand where to start there are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that it amazing it even got considered for the national award that this movie is awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased judgment of people who hold the <UNK> of indian cinema and the <UNK> understanding of the people who <UNK> appreciate this movie br br the topic chosen is great it is important that such movies be made  but only by people who are able to handle them <UNK> does not measure up to the task  not even close his direction is <UNK> confused there is no clear thought process he tries but is not able to explore the depth of the characters especially the grandfather he is not able to show the initial horror anxiety and then hopeless <UNK> and yet the <UNK> courage of the grandfather he wastes our time in the hospital when we should have been shown the time pair spend together he is trying to <UNK> in everything without any <UNK> he does not understand his subject properly and that really counts against him br br however the cast does not help <UNK> either worst job  she is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible acting job how did she get extremely lucky and or extremely influential and or extremely pitiful casting having said that she goes out of her way to do an even terrible job in this movie her act of the should have gone to the more responsible actor  <UNK> <UNK> did not understand it work under constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a calm strong exterior as this is <UNK> to the patients seems even more scared and in need of support than the people she is working for br br second worst  i have never seen a more wooden face in <UNK> film industry it is abound and everywhere in today's hindi cinema though he is the producer and so he chose himself no second thought no consideration any good actor would have jumped to play this role even if he had to pay the <UNK> to do it but would not let anyone else do it over ambitious and <UNK> he contributes to bring down the movie more than everyone else combined his acting lacks research and even the basic acting skills my choice for this role would be br br the music is uninspired the movie is technically lacking it could well have been an project job br br on the up side brilliant performance by it is amazing that such a young boy could give such a respectable performance he put many of today's actors to shame unintentionally maybe but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable performance also <UNK> really gave a very believable performance really put in all his efforts and it shows the script too is well written br br <UNK> cannot be a valid argument to praise this movie lack of <UNK> dogs all of the <UNK> movies <UNK> and hindi movies <UNK> all the money and the rest are left to fight for the <UNK> it is a sorry state of affairs but yet not reason enough to praise any immature movie that comes out <UNK> was brilliant movie and it too was made on a <UNK> budget <UNK> also lacked technically but it was well <UNK> and well made it was abound in details and supported by wonderful performances by everyone and that made it rich cinema why did it not receive the <UNK> it so very deserved  only proves my point of biased judgment br br lack of research and not of <UNK> is what makes such a bad movie
<START> i really enjoyed this movie it was edgy without being <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brought the <UNK> character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels br br i also saw iron giant and <UNK> is perfect the movie oh yeah it's called triple x or <UNK> was a weak example of his work in pitch black he plays an anti hero to the max i don't think you can go wrong when <UNK> stars in a movie unfortunately might type cast him as an adventure action movie star wrong i think the script for <UNK> was weak for which <UNK> couldn't act down to it br br anyway pitch black is a great scifi see it br br <UNK>
<START> this movie was nothing like the book br br everything was mixed up or changed most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book br br this movie never should have been viewed it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie <UNK> the entire thing br br i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j d br br honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is
<START> starts as unemployed martin sanders <UNK> hears something strange on his phone he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named diana <UNK> to meet her soon after martin reads a local paper sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered thinks back to what he heard martin <UNK> in his friends laura virginia <UNK> aaron oliver <UNK> but they don't believe him then shortly after the same thing happens again the phone call the man the prostitute her death reported in the papers martin decides he has to find the killer put a stop to his killing spree but who is it br br this <UNK> production that was apparently shot in just eight days why so long on a budget of about 3 000 why so much was written directed by sergio i cannot believe some of the glowing comments has on the imdb out of <UNK> user ratings as i write this of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10 i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10 if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it i honestly don't believe that if you showed to <UNK> average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect no way on earth the user comments are also amazingly positive all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film this the one user besides me who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up where do i start how on earth can i adequately describe how bad is the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it's terrible twists while most twists turn a plot on it's head <UNK> the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever relevant way are genuine surprises here in the twists destroy the first half of the film makes it utterly pointless in a <UNK> didn't actually <UNK> sort of way the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers what made martin go mad why did he imagine the phone calls why did he imagine a killer why did he imagine the newspaper <UNK> no explanation is given for <UNK> behaviour during the first hour or so of the film there's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind that's it that's all the exposition there is then there's a plot twist about <UNK> missing wife her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason i am sorry but is so bad it's so boring it's so badly written thought out that i honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it sorry guy's but that's how i feel quite simply is one of the worst films i have ever seen is a complete mess both <UNK> technically br br according to the imdb was hot in just eight days to be honest it doesn't feel like that at all nope it feels more like it was shot in five days the whole film is an <UNK> has probably the worst <UNK> shooting i have ever seen it's like no attempt was made to light the scenes it's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green <UNK> to them for no apparent reason which just looks <UNK> becomes increasingly irritating this strange <UNK> is not repeated on <UNK> scenes so they are also quite jarring noticeable there's no real horror or scares in fact i would say is more of a thriller than a horror as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a <UNK> a knife is stuck in <UNK> mouth nothing else br br according to the imdb this had a budget of about 3 000 which makes one of the lowest budgeted films ever <UNK> released surely some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window we should accept any old crap wrong to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product if this can get released praised like it's oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage including embarrassing <UNK> footage scenes of total <UNK> as we forgot to take off the lens cap win top <UNK> at the next cannes film festival the acting is awful although the female lead virginia <UNK> is actually rather sexy helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit br br is an absolutely terrible film seriously i beg you don't be fooled by all the fake positive comments there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10 an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through sorry but that's the way i see it sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind you have been warned

<START> five star final was one of the best films of the early 1930s it starred edward g robinson and was a very gritty story about a sleazy newspaper and their <UNK> to do anything anything to sell <UNK> in particular an old story of an innocent woman is <UNK> across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life many years after she was inadvertently involved in a scandal the reason i loved the film so much was that it was <UNK> and pulled no punches showing just how low the <UNK> can be to sell papers br br here in two against the world it is a remake of five star final with a few changes instead of robinson this film stars <UNK> bogart and he is the head of programming at a radio station not a newspaper otherwise the story is essentially the same except that it's a bit less edgy and lacks some of the <UNK> and <UNK> of the original this isn't to say the film is bad it just doesn't pack quite as good a punch as the first film in other words if you must see one of these films see the first though this film is quite powerful and enjoyable as well as for me i loved the story so much i saw both films and enjoyed them both br br two against the world begins with the <UNK> radio owner complaining to his programming head bogart that all the high brow shows he's put on are getting low ratings the owner demands <UNK> lots of <UNK> in order to get more <UNK> one way they discuss is to do a multi part <UNK> of a famous killing that occurred two decades ago even though the killer was <UNK> and she killed only in self defense however they decide to play up the story as if she was guilty and they even go so far as to both send a writer to the <UNK> home pretending to be a minister as well as <UNK> her current name and <UNK> needless to say this ruins the woman and leads to a horrible tragedy then and only then does bogart feel any real <UNK> for producing such garbage leading to a dandy finale about <UNK> integrity and decency br br well acted a great story idea and a message that is just as important today as it was back in the 1930s this is one story you have to see in particular notice the wonderful and very emotional confrontation scene where the daughter attacks the owner and bogart it is one heck of a great example of acting and writing
<START> a fine ironic visual gag takes place in front of the spectacular backdrop of a <UNK> <UNK> but who are those people who rush across screen at the end customers relatives one of the earliest <UNK> in cinematic history perhaps well worth a minute of your time
<START> kind of a guilty <UNK> nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school it really is a great <UNK> of the <UNK> punk scene in la in 1980 as the bands play <UNK> the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the <UNK> but also it turns the <UNK> <UNK> into that of tourist passing through this alien world the band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore then again it's not as easy to come by 16 month former church <UNK> like chavez of black flag does how many <UNK> of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal these guys just didn't care and who can't love the commentary of the little french dude who used to be the singer for catholic discipline of which was a member his gritty voice delivers one of the best <UNK> ever captured on film i have excellent news for the world there's no such thing as new wave <UNK> what a relief
<START> there's something intriguing about disaster movies the simple primal premise can lead to several great stories granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with that br br unfortunately <UNK> probably marks the low point in the history of this sub genre robert <UNK> is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters he gives a barely decent performance as well <UNK> <UNK> is very uneven veteran actor tom he played in doctor <UNK> for <UNK> sake is particularly bad i mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor what an embarrassing performance for that man the rest of the cast <UNK> from decent to really bad with one exception whom i thought might be there as a plot device eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared br br the script is really bad confusing and cliché some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other you've seen this story a thousand times it employs every dramatic hook and tear <UNK> you've seen in <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> movies original and remake and many others br br the direction is awful no sense of timing nothing inspired the shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor cgi the human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are <UNK> over scenes where the characters must actually face the <UNK> are rare and poorly done the made for tv feel gives <UNK> some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter no problem let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible br br the movie score is rather poor all over the place no timing br br the ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time very much like they ran out of ideas <UNK> that you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place must have ran out of budget br br this is a really amateur job i give it a 2 for using london as a location which is a nice change for being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent those of the water closing in on london and the gates br br do yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one this includes older classics like the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> im sure he <UNK> need the money for a life saving operation or transplant in all honesty i think this review qualifies as a better movie than thanks for listening
<START> all budding filmmakers should watch this movie it is like a <UNK> in digital film making in itself some of the scenes look like they have been shot on much higher production values than what they really have been it is very <UNK> that such a well crafted piece of work can be made on a low budget the acting is very good and the characters are very interesting particularly that of the lead boy john who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable his beautiful but <UNK> mother was also very well portrayed and the relationship between her and her boss was very intriguing this is a very quirky interesting piece and i will be looking for anything else made by the same team the director is certainly one to watch
<START> i think that this short tv series was absolutely wonderful and gave both a in depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time this was by far david attenborough at his best i personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade this is definitely worth peoples money br br i also found the bit about the <UNK> and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part it was incredible to find out that the <UNK> <UNK> team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life br br in this documentary almost certainly lived up to his high reputation br br this was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries br br many to the <UNK> <UNK> team
<START> set in and near a poor working class town in the mountains of rural italy it's a story of madness the landscape may be quite <UNK> but there's madness <UNK> <UNK> behind the mask of a person who seems <UNK> normal this person kills little children br br in style and tone this film resembles <UNK> <UNK> famous italian <UNK> those fascinating <UNK> horror films except that <UNK> films are much better looking still the visuals in <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> are competent with some interesting compositions and lighting lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence <UNK> one of the is <UNK> alone br br in one sequence the gore is a bit overdone but this is no slasher film a legitimate theme the story and that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms not just the obvious <UNK> of people who practice voodoo or black magic br br plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn't assume an agenda on the part of the director don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect the twist near the end provides good <UNK> however in one scene <UNK> through a line of dialogue could have been added to <UNK> the relationship between two characters one of whom is the murderer the film's finale takes place on a beautiful with the wind <UNK> in the background we see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset br br i don't care for the film's widescreen projection but background music is effective and <UNK> from <UNK> creepy at the beginning to low key jazz to <UNK> italian songs acting is generally average though in a couple of cases it's a bit overdone br br though not as visually brilliant as <UNK> <UNK> don't torture a <UNK> nevertheless is a fine film one that contains a <UNK> storyline and enough of a <UNK> puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries
<START> this game is a good looking first person <UNK> hang on br br but of course a story must be put around this genre so a quite innovative plot about soldiers now driven by drugs to save the world and kill the terrorist <UNK> is the drug of choice which creates a super soldier br br great now just give us some fun challenging missions throw in some great new weapons and free <UNK> vehicles that can be driven at our <UNK> and i will be quite content br br no br br the <UNK> of this game decide to create a military driven game that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and <UNK> democracy the game has twisted ideals that just re <UNK> morals that we learned when we were in primary school nothing new is told to us but drugs are bad then pushed in a type of <UNK> join the navy of how standing up for the common good given <UNK> on <UNK> and <UNK> right and wrong we get it let's kill something br br no br br you can't you are forced to endure extremely long gaps of <UNK> <UNK> t <UNK> such as run to helicopter go to group of troops then once this is completed cinematic takes over you sit there for at least half of the game watching little played out by the characters one's you cannot skip but sit and wait sometimes when people aren't even talking we sit and wait for a helicopter to land br br bad game by a laughable group of <UNK> don't bother making another because i will rather see the movie
<START> one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure movies as if those weren't reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about <UNK> accent or the lack of historical <UNK> or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn't love movies see it and be <UNK> by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly <UNK> film this is proof that hollywood can make 'em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10
<START> all i have to say is one word sucks the only reason i gave this a 2 is because josh <UNK> was in it and he's cool should have beat that <UNK> guys ass stupid dumb and brainless by the end of this movie you can't stand <UNK> and you really don't care what happens to <UNK> <UNK> was the only good thing about it
<START> if we really want to get serious and find <UNK> bin laden then we should take this stinker down to <UNK> and force the to watch it they'll be singing within minutes of course i'm sure that making them watch this god awful dreck <UNK> the <UNK> convention in several ways br br look my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie she got up and walked away after about ten minutes that's how bad this is br br you know when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium br br and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us
<START> taste is a <UNK> thing two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it as it concerns <UNK> the curse of michael <UNK> i fall into the latter category br br i'm of the opinion that john carpenter in 1978 made one of that <UNK> finest fright films which despite its flaws still holds up well into the 21st century it <UNK> many of the old horror film devices but <UNK> them in original and effective ways it had no <UNK> that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking <UNK> on halloween night and yet there were <UNK> in the film but they were subtly introduced and not <UNK> into your skull it <UNK> the <UNK> of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity br br the of this <UNK> probably wouldn't even understand that previous paragraph that's why we're <UNK> us with this miserable and inept piece of <UNK> celluloid direction script acting are of the lowest <UNK> imaginable this is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and <UNK> inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the <UNK> and die it is also truly truly sad to see veteran british actor donald <UNK> wasting his acting abilities with this <UNK> <UNK> of a movie he seems <UNK> of all his energy and <UNK> to the fact that this may be his last film maybe that's what killed him
<START> <UNK> followed le where no one knew who was <UNK> the poison thus everyone was suspected with another masterpiece <UNK> des four years later in which we know from the outset or think we do <UNK> top billed louis <UNK> doesn't appear for forty minutes by which time <UNK> has established a rich <UNK> of music hall music <UNK> etc and a fine cast of colourful characters angela lansbury <UNK> lansbury appeared in woman of paris that same year <UNK> scores as the <UNK> whose desire to improve her lot <UNK> the jealousy of her husband bernard <UNK> who follows her to the home of an elderly <UNK> only to find he is already dead from here things go seriously wrong his car is stolen before he leaves the premises so his pre arranged <UNK> is out the window whilst meanwhile unknown to him his wife <UNK> to the murder to the photographer <UNK> a closet lesbian in love with her who <UNK> to return to the crime scene and retrieve <UNK> and as long as she's there <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> of the murder weapon a <UNK> bottle at this point investigator <UNK> gets involved and from then on it's a case of keeping the <UNK> spinning in the air <UNK> <UNK> was relatively small but virtually all of it was as spencer <UNK> said in another context with le de and les <UNK> still to come in short this is a must for french cinema buffs
<START> i have a letter from ms knight who went to college with my older sister in it she tells of the <UNK> of making this film she herself was pregnant an interesting <UNK> with the movie's plot and the <UNK> director was unsure fairly green and having great difficulties with all the decisions <UNK> etc they were on the move all the time and it was a very difficult shoot br br the film however with a strong debut for james <UNK> remains effective and affecting it's a great showcase for the talent that ms knight has demonstrated her entire career on television in movies and on the stage where she won the tony for <UNK> children br br this film has aged well
<START> the movie starts with a <UNK> spoof which is your introduction to rick <UNK> played by drake bell of drake josh fame personally i'd have given the movie to josh who is much funnier and the rick joke is lifted right out of airplane so the writers were obviously already <UNK> the barrel for ideas for this film <UNK> class is on a science trip to the <UNK> <UNK> lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film brent <UNK> data in star trek <UNK> playing dr <UNK> rick is bitten by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is where his powers come from br br we meet our next big star names at <UNK> home his aunt lucille marion ross of happy days fame uncle albert leslie <UNK> of airplane police squad naked gun fame and we're introduced to <UNK> on the <UNK> board of directors dan from the simpsons who is then very promptly killed we're told rick has slept for 5 days get some cheap crappy sexually <UNK> scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention the stephen <UNK> scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny br br we get another <UNK> spoof rick catching the girl and all the planets but the movie should end right there as jill was hit in the head by a falling <UNK> ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead you get to see <UNK> 1st powers emerge gripping ability speed then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong we also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed we get a flashback and a batman spoof in which we discover rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents <UNK> <UNK> again uncle is shot with jeffrey <UNK> from <UNK> playing the hospital doctor we then get an x men spoof done very badly as patrick stewart is about as white as they come barry bonds is played by yet another <UNK> br br we meet invisible girl played by pamela anderson looking stunning in her costume 1st outing in his costume once he <UNK> his ability to see breath through it is another batman spoof the tom cruise youtube interview clip is played by yet another <UNK> and not a very good one at that there are lots of modern references like youtube <UNK> <UNK> all showing that the movie is set in modern day there's a very weak gay joke never a good idea to do those either when jill is helping aunt lucille make <UNK> dinner and the <UNK> scene isn't very funny just <UNK> br br the aunt <UNK> scene isn't particularly funny just incredibly childish anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12 she's killed and then we have a really bad <UNK> joke is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of at her funeral and the even worse <UNK> joke br br we get the 2 worst in the whole movie prince charles nelson <UNK> at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> this movie is <UNK> wins the <UNK> of the year award <UNK> is revealed as the <UNK> in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past jill twice in the same direction br br obviously the <UNK> is <UNK> jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one
<START> ugh this movie has so many unbelievable plot <UNK> that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess the story is halfway decent but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the <UNK> <UNK> then we're all in trouble roy <UNK> turns in a good performance as the president but it is unfortunately <UNK> by the truly <UNK> acting of patrick <UNK> who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of <UNK> at every opportunity regardless of whether the script calls for a <UNK> perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise or perhaps someone will see it and say hey if they can get a movie this bad made maybe i can too
<START> well what to say br br i think i shall start with a confession i have cried 4 times in my life once when my dad died twice due to a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this film this film deals with the real confronting issues of 6 school kids forcing them quite <UNK> into the open for all the world to see i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this everything from incest to is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the <UNK> of <UNK> with at least a couple of scenes br br it starts off with a suicide at 2 then without letting you know who it was that died the story begins to be told from the start of the day it follows the lives of 6 school kids up until 2 it <UNK> and edited with personal interviews of the 6 teenagers lets you know everything about their lives their loves hates dreams desires secrets shame false confidence self loathing corruption and arrogance the overall outcome of which is a sort of <UNK> trying to discover the identity of the <UNK> before it is revealed at the end of the film without spoiling anything i must let you know do not feel cheated by the ending it contains a very important lesson br br and now a warning this film is definitely not for the faint hearted many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it disgusted by some of it's content or perhaps it's that it's sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality this is what high school is like for many people i'm sure most would agree
<START> spend your time any other way even <UNK> is better than this movie the jokes aren't funny the fun <UNK> that are dr <UNK> aren't there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play <UNK> and the older ones left to play <UNK> and surf the net my wife left and did <UNK> so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn't funny isn't cute the <UNK> makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
<START> the long kiss <UNK> has just about everything action fans want a witty screenplay by the guy who wrote lethal weapon samuel l jackson and great action set pieces by <UNK> <UNK> br br seriously underrated one of the best action movies ever
<START> this is the latest <UNK> movie and it is also a major departure from the <UNK> established style first of all this film was obviously aimed at young children much more so than any of their previous films it lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of and yet it is ever so entertaining even though there is nothing put in to attract adults i still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story the movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters the story and the characters are very <UNK> with their feelings intentions etc but that makes them all the more endearing special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous <UNK> <UNK> i find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie
<START> i'm slowly <UNK> through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to <UNK> wan <UNK> who is one of my favourite actors br br its a great action film although not as <UNK> as the title might suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable br br the biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob the guy who did the to <UNK> song which was popular in 'the <UNK> has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and <UNK> it into one of the tracks on his <UNK> album the tune in question is called <UNK> not driving <UNK> and is also the opening tune for the tv series <UNK> and <UNK> and the opening track on the <UNK> dvd menu <UNK> that really surprised me due to the sheer
<START> take someone you love or want to love and go see this film br br it touches you in all the right places br br all the other reviewers here have said it all br br perhaps the cynical will not be impressed br br they only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days br br this film is <UNK> run to stay with you for life br br i am so <UNK> that the director is not <UNK> trained br br this <UNK> my premise that there is too much mediocrity and <UNK> in film these days br br it is because of the <UNK> mentality and <UNK> br br <UNK> for jeff <UNK> and richard marcus cast and crew well done
<START> this is by far the worst movie ever made i have no doubt i have seen such crap as <UNK> space <UNK> and <UNK> and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed br br science crazed has no plot something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey and the child born hours later is fully grown and ready to kill of course being a <UNK> it takes him about an hour to kill people the director <UNK> footage constantly and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken br br <UNK> scene the monster is walking down a hall we know this because there is about ten minutes of <UNK> footage of his feet in between <UNK> we are treated to two women working out repeat ad <UNK> for about 20 minutes when the monster does show up no one moves and everyone looks like deer in <UNK> as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them by the level of the acting you would guess that the people are already dead br br i know my description doesn't seem too bad but trust me i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed br br stay away and <UNK> all video stores that carry it br br
<START> <UNK> is one of the great epic war films sure others such as birth of a nation and <UNK> had come before but this one is just as influential the acting is stock but anyone who knows the first thing about <UNK> would know that that was part of his theory of film this film unlike many of his silent works is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group this reflects the <UNK> philosophy that had <UNK> to the <UNK> by 1938 still his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil <UNK> is just one of many men he is prince because he is strongest but not because he is somehow different than the rest the film's romantic angles provide more of a personal story than <UNK> had previously allowed not all of the elements work and the film is probably a bit too long but it still <UNK>
<START> imaginary heroes the remarkable work of the then 24 year old dan harris is tag <UNK> people are never who they seem to be perhaps this is wisely chosen as a <UNK> of marketing yet i rented this movie in spite of the tag line rather than because of it and i'm glad i did i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy i personally found it to be a movie about <UNK> with dreams particularly those which are lost in the case of one son loss requires deep examination of what he had and didn't have in his life yet the central tragedy of the movie while posing <UNK> questions in its own right acts primarily as the backdrop against which different <UNK> styles are set into relief i believe the film <UNK> into an important question how do we cope with our dreams particularly where heroes become imaginary
<START> worthless movie a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be the <UNK> makes it seem as if it is of the american pie genre it isn't rather it is a ridiculous <UNK> together of <UNK> that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise let's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad snl skit into a full length feature presentation what is remarkable is that the director's based on their commentary on the dvd take themselves completely seriously i have been a huge fan of the movies that national lampoon lends its name to up to and including van wilder with this one i feel completely cheated in fact i feel <UNK> i was expecting a van wilder like farce to <UNK> my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage what lead to my ultimately <UNK> expectations well for starters the fact that the cast all appear naked with an enormous <UNK> covering what must be covered on the cover of the dvd add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you <UNK> people into thinking this is a movie that it is not to make matters worse the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half naked drunk college students <UNK> trying a photo stunt but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie in fact i didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until i was told so by the directors in the commentary don't get me wrong i love plot twists and being surprised by movies but i hate the fact that this movie tries to <UNK> itself off as something it is not ultimately it does itself a huge <UNK> artistically though most likely not <UNK> because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it <UNK> to deliver what it <UNK> br br in short do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case it is not your usual national lampoon movie the only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and tv shows that make their involvement here entertaining
<START> very simply they are all the <UNK> episodes and not the original uncut <UNK> nbc episodes it is not the complete first season all <UNK> are edited to <UNK> to 21 00 for <UNK> meaning jokes are cut an extra commercial fade is included all of the harvey <UNK> <UNK> are not here very poorly done shame on a series i've been waiting for if you're a true die hard mama fan don't buy this and go to http com web main help <UNK> service and send them comments on why we're unhappy on this butcher job to a classic sitcom
<START> the movie was fantastic if your a fan of videos jackass or his show <UNK> la <UNK> you cant help but like it i have a few friends who aren't fans that enjoyed it and others who thought it wasn't that great those who didn't like it were mostly female friends they really didn't appreciate some of the crude humor that personally i think made the movie so funny i'm pretty sure the entire movie was filmed in <UNK> home town which includes a lot of his regularly visited locations the cast of is made up of all his friends and buddies and also includes some big name pro too the soundtrack is phenomenal with music by him in my opinion <UNK> has it all a great plot characters you'll never see anywhere else plenty of humor great music and a cast that was dedicated to the project
<START> even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the finest performances by alan <UNK> and <UNK> without a doubt this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason whether they are or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame it still scares the hell out me today it's happening now br br apparently imdb requires ten lines to meet their <UNK> for a film review imdb might want to get a grip some of us are a little more <UNK> about writing opinions
<START> terry cunningham directs this sci fi network original all is not well in washington state and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to drop most of the pacific <UNK> in the ocean trying to keep the world from <UNK> in <UNK> havoc a crack team of scientists led by dr jake <UNK> luke perry take a massive earth <UNK> vehicle called the mole to chew its way to the <UNK> fiery core to <UNK> impending doom technical dialog doesn't really help or speed this movie along the acting is lame but then perry has always been laid back you can only blame him for taking part others in the cast michael <UNK> adam frost and michael
<START> the philosophical <UNK> tone of this movie <UNK> it one of a kind i'd give it 10 stars for that alone that being said though what hit me with particular force was what i take possibly <UNK> to be its art direction many of the interior shots feature a rich <UNK> of color <UNK> seemingly based on very understated color model and <UNK> <UNK> this makes the movie probably unrealistic to contemporary eyes but to me very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself i think this movie is genuinely unique for this quality and if for no other reason earns it a full careful digital <UNK> fox are you listening
<START> naturally along with everyone else i was <UNK> to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy <UNK> in they died with their boots on over the legend of <UNK> just having someone like errol flynn play <UNK> is enough of a clue that the legend has <UNK> over the truth in this production and for the most part my expectations were <UNK> in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way br br yet even in this obviously biased and much criticized retelling of the <UNK> story i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that sometimes subtly but nevertheless <UNK> seemed to counter the typical clichés of <UNK> destiny and <UNK> <UNK> usually found in westerns of the early 20th century br br for instance even while this film attempted to <UNK> it's hero certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real life <UNK> br br 1 his initial entrance at the west point front gate in which his arrogance and is a clear aspect of his character br br 2 his miserable record at west point which seems to be attributed as much to <UNK> <UNK> about the demands of military service as any other factor there are moments in the way flynn plays <UNK> at west point where he seems downright stupid br br 3 <UNK> promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake but it plays out as slapstick comedy i half expected to see the marx brothers or <UNK> and <UNK> wander into the scene br br 4 <UNK> stand against <UNK> stuart at <UNK> is not <UNK> as brilliant military <UNK> <UNK> but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky br br 5 <UNK> drinking problem is certainly not ignored br br and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly <UNK> of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land and fairly <UNK> laid the blame for the battles in the black hills <UNK> at the foot of the white man in fact no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull but arthur kennedy co as the white <UNK> making the false claim of gold in the black hills sure that part of the story is true but i didn't expect to see it portrayed quite so in a movie like this br br and one other thing usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en <UNK> as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol in this movie it is actually the troops of the <UNK> <UNK> and not the indians who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way br br all in all this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood <UNK>
<START> excellent drama very dark i have never seen california photographed in such a way bridget fonda as the deaf wife beaten by her husband is superb the film <UNK> me from start to finish very understated performance by sutherland the direction was very european amazing to get such a performance from fonda
<START> i enjoyed this film very much i found it to be very entertaining for me in that i feel that it captured the <UNK> of turn of the century irish american culture there's no messages there's no violence and there's no overt sex just wholesome <UNK> style entertainment and dennis morgan had a chance to sing some really good songs a really good movie
<START> you thought after surprise that german comedy can't get worse it can this comedy is yet another attempt at <UNK> stereotypes of gay men masked as a nice comedy the initial concept openly gay men in soccer sports would have been a great opportunity to <UNK> some stereotypes but the real intended message of the movie seems to be in what way gay men are oh so different from straight men absolutely silly of course even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex this movie only tries to serve straight audiences wanting to laugh about stereotypical gay men well don't waste your time on german comedy movies
<START> i thought it will be a ok movie after seeing the commercials about it it was funny at some parts and some very nasty the only person i felt sorry for is <UNK> sans who got a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women but he never got a chance to have a <UNK> with until the and that was good but they should have made more bigger thru out the film
<START> my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very very different from the book the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america she meets <UNK> an aspiring graphic novelist working in a chocolate shop in the day she must accept that she will never be normal because every full moon she becomes a a thought to be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf br br most of the little changes didn't sound too bad to me even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by <UNK> curtis <UNK> i knew it would be different but i wanted to see it to support the book thinking that an age change a setting change and a few little <UNK> changes wouldn't impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their <UNK> and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground br br the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters one being mother right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father i pushed that aside and <UNK> forth into the movie weary and slightly annoyed running through romania the camera angles were decent the scenery was beautiful and the music was interesting but it left me with the impression of why does vivian look like that and why is she wearing a <UNK> jumping to later parts of the movie i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and <UNK> the leader of the five now became her cousin through her surprise aunt <UNK> who in the novel was the bitter and hated rival of mother and might i add no way related to either of them br br to top off character <UNK> gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy not only did his physical appearance take a complete <UNK> from the description in the book he was apparently also the father of <UNK> yes that's right it's a nice little incestuous <UNK> of all <UNK> up tight br br little things that <UNK> me were scenes like the forest <UNK> there was a red head that stood out from the rest of the crowd the one who <UNK> their enemy before their prey was set free to run and be hunted why was she there why did she look like <UNK> i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims br br i loved how the <UNK> was completely cut out of the movie i loved how <UNK> <UNK> past was what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self defense and then beat his father up in self defense to make him seem like such a tragic character br br character are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary at the end of the movie i felt as if some person <UNK> over the novel <UNK> down half the list of character names drew a few connections here and there mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk vivian fell in love with <UNK> he fears her when he finds out she is a of the legends and somebody is killed by a silver bullet and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is br br i gave this movie a 2 10 because the camera shots were relatively decent and the casting could have been worse but as far as directing goes why do the leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly with their <UNK> backs and <UNK> to leap from high places <UNK> briefly and then fall onto the ground as wolves the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very <UNK> sorry ending were the wolves the beautiful scenery and the eye candy boys br br all together i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all one must be ready for <UNK> strange happenings that are not always explained incestuous <UNK> and have either not liked the book or have not read the book
<START> spoiler with plot explanation a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy that pops out from nowhere and no questions asked that went <UNK> and casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death with every frame movie gets more and more predictable a big disappointment ending <UNK> completely dumb it has nothing to <UNK> with the movie itself i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s t this way or other so it may as well have a stupid ending waste of time resources and money actor play is very poor if you think about the dialogs you may find out that family conflict is <UNK> <UNK> by poor communication between characters some scenes <UNK> random in summary boring predictable poor pathetic waste of time and money
<START> it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time the historical aspect was great everything else was horrible the <UNK> for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time when there was evidence it would fly by most of it was just people talking about the place the episode of the show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this i haven't watched it since it aired
<START> to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism however when a film is <UNK> made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with and it is slow as <UNK> with no real payoff i think it's fair to call a spade a spade and the ghost is a very boring film br br a movie that is about as original as its' name the ghost tells the story of a young girl with <UNK> being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past only it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think br br the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook the <UNK> element only makes things worse it seems that no one including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the <UNK> equivalent of a sitcom clip show there are scenes taken directly from <UNK> dark water <UNK> the grudge series and a <UNK> of pulse for good measure making matters worse the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike making them impossible to tell apart br br there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film the story isn't all that well thought out the <UNK> gimmick is lazy the mystery element is un involving and handled with little grace the characters never <UNK> anything all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot br br the cinematography full of <UNK> and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext a <UNK> link with the <UNK> and the final twist which i won't reveal is nice but often overwrought even the score feels borrowed and cliché br br worst of all the <UNK> action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame wait you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end no audiences are too <UNK> for this kind of tripe anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature i used to think <UNK> was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap <UNK> his grudge film no less than 5 times but even his second rate work like reincarnation a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish is miles ahead of this br br for more reviews please visit www com
<START> i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that <UNK> years earlier it would have been moving images accompanied by music later it would have been sound added to <UNK> eventually it would have been technicolor <UNK> or <UNK> this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture during all the emotional scenes the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they <UNK> off into the distance or appeal to the camera this <UNK> is painful at it's very least imagine these top <UNK> actors trying to look busy while the narration <UNK> on painful i have no idea who came up with this gimmick but it was the only time i ever saw it used and for good reason in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes <UNK> their hands or <UNK> to such a degree i actually wondered if this was really a comedy br br the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations norma <UNK> disappointed in love <UNK> for a reason to live she has a friend played by ralph morgan who <UNK> her but she takes him for granted she is attracted to a doctor played by clark gable but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her she <UNK> for a <UNK> that needs her desperately she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him along comes the doctor who <UNK> pops a <UNK> in her <UNK> only to find out later that he loves her after all the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all confused yet forget the rest just watch a couple of episodes of as the world turns and it'll all become clear br br if your are ever forced to watch this movie hold out for the final scene the <UNK> of the actors put harold lloyd to shame it is not to be missed
<START> i speak badly of g i j t m mostly because i think it lacked something that g i joe had yes it had something that g i joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson and burgess meredith but i think g i joe the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g i joe tv series had most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i m h o br br although violence is what g i joe was built on i'd say that striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie character to go out neither was seeing remind <UNK> commander why he was chosen to lead the <UNK> forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what <UNK> la felt was rightfully theirs br br it wasn't the best way for the g i joe series to go out but it's better than nothing
<START> this movie has been promoting in everywhere in spain with a huge publicity campaign after watching it you realise that someone has stolen your money paz vega is horrible as carmen <UNK> not natural at all and she looks like <UNK> making a fashion magazine cover in all the shots the best is when she as an <UNK> woman speak <UNK> and <UNK> is much better than her as jose but the story is very slow the plot <UNK> work and the screenplay is really very very bad i think penelope <UNK> the film was written for her would have been a much more credible and sexy carmen br br what a waste of time and money
<START> watching the last 2 episodes i remembered a tv add from my childhood it showed the wild west very dusty and dry and there is a small saloon a man enters the bar saloon he is <UNK> as hell lips <UNK> etc he has just walked through the <UNK> desert and hasn't drunk water for days he to the bartender <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> while he is eating it we can feel how he is getting we hear a voice in the background saying keep building that <UNK> build it till you cant hold it any more then blow it away with team the man drinks team a soft drink it feels like a few dozen <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is so intense that i cannot hold it any more season 2 has even more twists and turns then season 1 the ending answers a lot of questions but asks many many more questions hopefully we will know the answer in season 3 but i doubt it because i feel lost has the momentum go a lot further then 3 seasons if the people behind the camera keep up their good work br br i for one will keep watching br br from <UNK> with love
<START> ok i went to this website before i watched this movie read the comments got <UNK> cause they where all pretty good for a b flick watched it and was completely disappointed the main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the mid west act was sickening to the stomach and don't even get me started on the two cops i mean there's a bloody door right there in plain view check it out the plot was completely predictable the editing was rather limited i swear the editor was even <UNK> off near the end when he was cutting this movie and the direction was <UNK> by bad cinematography now please don't get me wrong i love b flicks some are really good br br want to watch a good b rated flick br br dave <UNK> br br high tension br br http imdb com title
<START> i'm from australia and have watched with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding <UNK> union in new zealand i can totally appreciate the comments made by in relation to this movie it was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport br br whoever was involved in the making of this atrocious movie should be made to <UNK> apologize to anyone who had the misfortune of watching it note people do not <UNK> down and cry while slowly <UNK> the what a pitiful scene this was br br are we supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed his girlfriend who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain then apparently saw the light what a thoroughly <UNK> character with the visits to children's <UNK> doing nothing to redeem his despicable personality br br and why are people even making a movie about americans playing <UNK> they barely even feature in the sport on the world stage not so much as to even warrant an attempt at making a movie about it yes a <UNK> sport unlike <UNK> and baseball
<START> all right it was in black and white and probably on 2 tape which means the bbc wiped it right but it stays in my mind from all those years ago 1960 as a perfect slice of history <UNK> by the most innovative editing and wonderful actors full of youth and <UNK> br br i want to see it again are you reading this bbc find your original 2 tapes or the <UNK> film deal with the actors and directors for the rights and re issue i know i know some of them are dead some of them are missing in action br br where else will i be able to see mary morris as the heart wrapped in a <UNK> where else will i be able to see paul do <UNK> is the winter of <UNK> ' or robert hardy deliver his speech about <UNK> idol
<START> sherlock holmes films from the classic universal era tend to range in quality this range goes from very good to above average with none of their <UNK> being abysmal or <UNK> brilliant sherlock holmes and the secret weapon fits <UNK> into the middle ground quality wise and as ever it's an enjoyable outing that fans of the series like myself will enjoy very much this film sees holmes in the middle of a world war 2 plot by the evil <UNK> to steal a swiss <UNK> invention which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield the world war 2 sherlock holmes films don't tend to be as good as the ones such as the scarlet claw where holmes is <UNK> private <UNK> as they're usually <UNK> by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery this one however pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on holmes and his investigation the film works much better perhaps universal saw what brought down the earlier voice of terror and changed the focus because of that br br basil <UNK> once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while <UNK> bruce doesn't feature as much as normal it's nice to see him when he does the two don't spent much time together which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about holmes films but this does allow more time for holmes to <UNK> in various <UNK> which is always lots of fun dennis <UNK> is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters and while he's not as funny as usual his facial expressions are great and his presence helps to <UNK> how great holmes is his scene with watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film it's good to see <UNK> nemesis professor <UNK> return even if it does seem like he's just been thrown in for the hell of it lionel <UNK> performance isn't as good as george in the adventures of sherlock holmes as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind but seeing him lock <UNK> with the protagonist is fun and it's nice to see him in the film to <UNK> the world war 2 themes which are never as interesting as holmes himself the film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick but once it gets going it's hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a lovely <UNK> played by playboy model <UNK> <UNK> falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely <UNK> these people love to sing and dance and fool <UNK> alice has a series of sensual adventures among these br br the film was originally shot as a poem to <UNK> with few explicit sex scenes which were eventually cut from its theatrical <UNK> versions however have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with <UNK> br br for an extremely low budget picture the producers of this film did an extremely good the cinematography is full of life and energy the dances and numbers quite professional and the acting without a doubt it is one of the best adult fairy tales <UNK>
<START> this may be one of the best movies i have ever seen it has anything but a trite plot and leaves one wondering which way it will go next it is an interesting portrayal of the struggles of youth youth who are interested in more than immediate <UNK> youth who show some concern about the desires and needs of others
<START> sorry for all you guys that are not family with the <UNK> br br my sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie i told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces br br after every movie i tell myself again one and a half hour lost of my life but next time i will check the director's or producers name br br so you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time don't watch it but if you think that you need to kill someone watch it this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane
<START> i stumbled across this movie late at night on tv my brother and i could not stop laughing at how god awful this movie is the crappy sound effects whenever white ninja or black ninja punch kick or use a weapon is hilarious this movie is almost on the same level as the evil dead series but you can only watch this movie once because of <UNK> <UNK> i'm not sure if the director meant for it to be so crappy on purpose because he knew idiots like me would buy it
<START> an incomprehensible script when it shouldn't have been <UNK> on a rather <UNK> voice over br br the animation however show real talent br br quite visually impressive
<START> george <UNK> was a fine actor often playing eyed villains with a <UNK> intensity however even he couldn't save this dull and flat <UNK> b flick br br <UNK> plays the usual mad scientist dr <UNK> cameron who believes that <UNK> blood <UNK> into humans can create an <UNK> army of wolf men who can win the world war ii go figure <UNK> on <UNK> the <UNK> glenn strange <UNK> creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches <UNK> is obviously based on <UNK> from of mice and men and you almost keep expecting him to say duh okay george there's one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian very pedestrian <UNK> minute <UNK> through all the old clichés that are done far better in other movies we also get the revenge <UNK> from the devil bat worked in in itself a <UNK> from son of frankenstein br br <UNK> is wasted and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes the <UNK> hand and dr secret to see how wasted a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer really and the scene where <UNK> demonstrates his wolf man technique to those who <UNK> him again shades of dr <UNK> and mr hyde is unintentionally hilarious br br not one of the better 40s b movies
<START> stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of <UNK> christmas carol in its sensibility the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney <UNK> as the alexander <UNK> character <UNK> is the modern equivalent of <UNK> scrooge in the way he control over his employees until the christmas spirit <UNK> him the role is a in the <UNK> for <UNK> who had been one of the great when he was part of the company <UNK> had only entered films five years earlier when at age <UNK> he was featured in what was to become a film classic the first and best film john huston ever directed 'the <UNK> <UNK> was probably never better in his traditional role as the <UNK> of middle european the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem
<START> it seems on the surface to be a romantic planes trains and <UNK> but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage <UNK> around not really going anywhere br br but if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camera work is <UNK> at best br br one note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of around
<START> first of all even imdb is with this movie as the list of cast is very even main characters are missing from it like buddy for example br br now back to the movie i love watching movies but this one tortured me throughout the whole <UNK> or however many minutes it was horrid probably the worst movie i have ever seen and the reason why it bothers me so much is because i was quite excited about seeing it beforehand br br the plot line itself is good it could have been a great film if done properly and with careful casting golden brooks was a huge disappointment i now see that the only role she can be good in is the loud fun loving energetic sexy chick she plays on girlfriends melodramatic roles are not for her at all she basically killed her character rachel br br i love some of the cast like deborah cox mel jackson and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but even they couldn't save this <UNK> movie of course it is only my personal opinion that i can not stand hill <UNK> as a man and he didn't help me get to like him more here either br br golden <UNK> voice bothered me so much that i actually had to force myself to finish watching the movie it seemed like she <UNK> throughout the whole joint the director i won't even waste board space on he did such a bad job the editing photography camera focus and just about everything about this movie was sad not to mention the dialogs absolutely unreal and many times straight hilarious when it was supposed to make you cry and search deep within yourself br br as i said it could have been a very nice movie but it was seriously messed up i would not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematography major and want to see a <UNK> not to <UNK> example for their future work br br have a great day everyone
<START> i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in she will write her own review later br br this is my all time favorite movie it was filmed in england in 1944 i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape i love this movie and it changed my life the beautiful landscapes the mighty pie bold <UNK> horse the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done compete in the grand national in london with her most beloved horse the pirate it all made me want to ride horses which i have done now for 7 years and learn everything i could about their <UNK> so i could also draw and paint them it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds <UNK> your fears believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working very hard also the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races i never get tired of watching this movie everything about it is perfect especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses
<START> my first post at the imdb has to unfortunately be to warn others not to waste their time with the <UNK> there is no story no character development no scares and no good lighting it doesn't make any sense if you enjoy bad acting people running through small portions of <UNK> <UNK> cameras <UNK> at bad angles and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness you'll love this movie i could shut the lights off in my house and scream too and i wouldn't have to pay for the rental the only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie this awful br br one of the worst movies i've ever rented
<START> cocky medical students play chicken with process that <UNK> death in attempt to get a hopefully temporary view of the <UNK> certain plot twists and themes are a little off the mark and the acting occasionally goes over the top but the underlying message about god's and <UNK> forgiveness for our real or perceived sins is positive and unique in cinema and the cast is very very good the last sequence between julia roberts and her father is so effectively done that years after having seen it i still get chills thinking about it highly recommended
<START> cult film maker <UNK> of his thirteen spaghetti westerns of which i'm only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution 1972 to catch is one i only became aware of fairly recently via <UNK> guide it's an <UNK> bleak genre gem in the style of the director's own masterpiece the great silence 1968 complete with desolate snowy landscapes br br johnny the french elvis <UNK> whom i first saw in jean luc <UNK> detective 1985 is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti hero <UNK> who like clint eastwood's the man with no name from sergio <UNK> celebrated dollars trilogy is <UNK> with a steel plate armor for protection incidentally i had stunning daughter laura at the 2004 <UNK> film festival but was distracted by the presence of her <UNK> director claude <UNK> is another curious addition to the <UNK> serving pretty much the same function that frank <UNK> did in the great silence but <UNK> himself well and is <UNK> clumsy in the presence of a bathing <UNK> <UNK> the latter then plays a greedy <UNK> of a <UNK> widow who <UNK> all and <UNK> in the pursuit of her goals <UNK> has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by and who at one point is into free love by <UNK> <UNK> with this is mind it's worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome <UNK> of nudity from both <UNK> and incidentally the <UNK> addition of a bunch of long haired <UNK> who also engage in <UNK> smoking and revolutionary talk is a somewhat half baked attempt at contemporary relevance  but it all eventually adds to the fun besides even the black <UNK> sports an <UNK> <UNK> br br mario too enjoys himself tremendously with the role of a larger than life mexican <UNK> <UNK> el <UNK>  who keeps a youthful <UNK> constantly by his side an element which may have influenced clint eastwood's <UNK> 1992 and at one point challenges the captive to a head <UNK> duel having mentioned this the film also contains one very unusual of <UNK>  as <UNK> of an <UNK> by kicking the cash register of the saloon into his face as always the <UNK> fake <UNK> are accompanied by over <UNK> sound effects equally typically for the genre however the <UNK> score by <UNK> <UNK> emerges a most significant asset actually the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film's generally somber tone  after <UNK> <UNK> at the hands of the locals the hippies who had previously <UNK> <UNK> suddenly turn against him when wounded and <UNK> the town forcing everyone on the street and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge they however <UNK> away at the <UNK> of facing him and then rides out of town leaving behind br br in conclusion i acquired this via a good quality widescreen print in italian albeit with french credits and the occasional <UNK>  about one minute of screen time in all  into the french language where apparently the original soundtrack wasn't available
<START> this is by far and away the stupidest thing i have ever seen on celluloid i mean we started watching it assuming it was a <UNK> t a flick but aside from a couple boobs that was it i mean i get the point of making stupid movies in order to show some sex scenes as they are the sole reason for a movie of that kind to be made this movie however has no sex scenes and really has no point at all there is no linear time the scenes travel around like a fart in the wind people show up for no reason then leave and it is never explained the plot is never advanced and nothing happens i have never been as <UNK> at how bad a movie was until i saw this has the director even been to a film school has he ever seen a movie i don't know but from the looks of it he seems to have made some moron proud with this piece of crap as he is still working i literally walked away from this movie dumber but i still recommend watching it as it should be shown in every film school of the country as an example in what not to do when making a film move over plan 9 from outer space you have a new <UNK> for worst movie ever made
<START> hilarious and low budget comedy at it's best this set of unique individual sketches with extensive self <UNK> humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy kids in the hall be prepared for some of the most random and <UNK> worthy lines filled with ethnic <UNK> and awful language sex toys included br br there should be more comedy like this around today this collection of sketches on one dvd will warrant many viewings and in order to appreciate some of the parts if you enjoyed the state and or wet hot american summer get ready for some more glory if you are even considering this for younger audiences i would say that every child on earth should see this
<START> if you watched this film for the nudity as i did you won't be disappointed i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though some <UNK> nudity could have be shown but for what it was i think h o t s has to be the best of its genre br br it is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times br br i would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day br br it is a shame that the dvd doesn't have any extras but as they didn't have dvds when this was filmed that is understandable i would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end
<START> the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this <UNK> so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth <UNK> on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday <UNK> my god it's depressing like all <UNK> it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who <UNK> the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by its <UNK> was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they'd slash their <UNK> within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more than you'll ever see here take my advice avoid this <UNK> of the british tv industry it is evil
<START> i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time it has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes which are in it in all the 3 schneider movies without a doubt several <UNK> in germany and throughout europe have made studies on <UNK> way of seeing things by the way <UNK> schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the jazz in germany maybe europe he is mostly inspired by the great m davis and t monk so if you do not like him it is ok but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid cheap boring or not funny because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of h schneider you would have to surrender
<START> <UNK> is a fantastic film in itself it is nothing like the book which may its <UNK> followers yet viewed on it's own the film is a masterpiece the views are spectacular and the acting isn't too bad either nicolas cage was brilliant so different from his usual action hero type characters penelope <UNK> is superb and really holds the film together i think that this film has to be judged as an project not related to the book louis de gave up rights to the film script so the film is an interpretation of the director john go and see this film with an open mind you'll love it because underneath is the touching story of love and war
<START> i've slowly been collecting the films available on dvd of both catherine <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both actress and director have done some <UNK> in their time fortunately <UNK> mermaid is not one of them br br next to the soft skin <UNK> staring <UNK> sister the late <UNK> this would have to be my favourite <UNK> film br br as well as directing <UNK> also wrote the screenplay something that always strikes me about <UNK> is his almost <UNK> innocence when presenting a story one could almost call it <UNK> br br there's a scene towards the end of the film where <UNK> returns to the apartment in <UNK> with the remains of the <UNK> he rings the and <UNK> answers wearing a <UNK> in the time it takes <UNK> to reach their room from the street <UNK> changes into her dress puts on her best pair of <UNK> and shoes then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep it's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child but that's <UNK> for you br br watching catherine <UNK> in her films of the late 60's is indeed a <UNK> pleasure she is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch incidentally for those fans there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film indeed a <UNK> pleasure br br i disagree with previous posters i see nothing about the film at all as for the <UNK> of it i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's it certainly gives films of this period a unique look br br highly recommended for both <UNK> and <UNK> fans
<START> this is the only <UNK> shore movie you should ever see o k it's the only one i've ever seen and i think i've made good choices i normally find <UNK> <UNK> kind of tired but he is very funny in this movie actually the script is pretty funny and shore doesn't <UNK> the other actors with his what do you call it <UNK> anyway this is a funny if ultimately forgettable film 3
