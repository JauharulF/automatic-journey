<START> this documentary was nominated for an oscar and it's easy to see why even 45 years later it is quite an impressive piece of work why it isn't in print is a mystery that only disney can explain good use of live footage and animation in <UNK> this used to run as part of vault disney every few months or so but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while sigh most recommended
<START> what are the odds of a mermaid <UNK> balloon traveling from <UNK> city <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> 1993 and landing 4 days later on <UNK> 12 in mermaid prince edward island canada <UNK> <UNK> miles this is a great movie it is based on a true story this movie helps not only children cope with <UNK> but older people as well hope everyone will enjoy it <UNK>
<START> this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that freddy's dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible 3 d ending and over the top corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this <UNK> pile of <UNK> it's no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two <UNK> appearances i would too if i went out like that this is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame
<START> this is a gorgeous movie visually the images of the mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their <UNK> costumes all amount to a real work of art br br the story seems a bit loose but that's because it's not meant to be realistic it is taken from a book called one hundred years of <UNK> and it is supposed to be an <UNK> of the isolated <UNK> atmosphere of latin america so far from god and so close to the united states the tremendous debt that <UNK> owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden although there many layers of meaning br br if you can appreciate a slow moving richly <UNK> movie this one is for you
<START> while flipping through the channels on a late saturday night my friends and i stumbled across this film first of all irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american seriously his accent was breaking through so much although his character was apparently scottish next i was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played james bond agent <UNK> at least twice this movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure the girl who played <UNK> should be paid to keep her mouth shut and this film won an award i cannot believe it brosnan is an attractive man but we seriously wanted to <UNK> our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds we switched from kicking and screaming to this and we wanted to switch back we watched the 1995 children's classic the indian in the <UNK> earlier in the night which also discussed the <UNK> the following line represents our desire to run away take me outside earth <UNK> from grey owl if you don't like it you don't have to watch
<START> soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me i won't tell you what its about i'm sure you already read the summary this is a great doomed <UNK> action science fiction movie kurt russell doesn't say much he usually has an eerie or <UNK> look on his face but it fits the character there are great action and fight scenes some of the scenes are unrealistic but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites i'm lucky enough to have a wife that <UNK> on guy movies we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy sci fi movies
<START> this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about 150 people to st george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st george temple not one person had dry eyes in the audience also there were some non religious and anti mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and <UNK> of the story of the <UNK> and the <UNK> they faced because of their beliefs br br i recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the <UNK> that the <UNK> went through after all it is apart of american history
<START> wow that's about as much as i can say right now who writes this stuff who produces this stuff what self <UNK> actor would agree to <UNK> in this stuff oh my god i don't know how i made it through this movie but i assume the fact that i had had like 8 <UNK> of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake good lord it was one of the most <UNK> out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed and for the record i don't ever plan to <UNK> it again br br i first saw the film when i bought the dvd mistake 1 i mean i figured hey julia stiles i like her she's cool i'll watch it as soon as i get home mistake 2 i tried to watch it without <UNK> every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end really i did but i was <UNK> it was one of the worst things i had ever seen i mean what is with that thing where he <UNK> what would happen then <UNK> back into real life that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in <UNK> like ten years ago the <UNK> and believe me it takes a lot out of me to call them that are stupid the characters are trite and forgettable the storyline is entirely predictable altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i'd never heard of this movie it was most likely a straight to dvd br br to anybody who may be thinking of watching this i have one piece of advice don't for the love of god don't i'm ashamed to have it in my dvd collection and i can't get rid of it nobody and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me and i'm talking second hand and third hand <UNK> <UNK> that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window that should let you know just how crap it is
<START> if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the <UNK> style of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating to much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> to try something new as he has <UNK> to much sex centered jokes seems to show that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique however in the end i found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> experimental yet still to much focused on <UNK> work
<START> so many consider the black cat as the best karloff lugosi collaboration i disagree the invisible ray is their best a great storyline fantastic special effects and classic karloff over acting i love it
<START> george lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom the first episodes i saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom as i have watched this more there has been more more variety no one on the cast is really safe from his wit now br br it seems to me as this season has progressed that george is getting more comfortable with the family sitcom dad role at first he wasn't but he is getting more more into a groove this makes both him the shows <UNK> funnier they had added a couple of characters for george to play off this year too his wife's dad is getting more more involved in the plot br br his mom is still there but not as central as past seasons i think it is <UNK> to say with <UNK> sense of comic timing <UNK> lack of good sitcoms george lopez has a good chance of being here on abc long after george w bush
<START> thomas <UNK> always had a knack for bringing simple <UNK> stories to life with <UNK> and flair the italian is such a film solid acting particularly by george <UNK> father of silent child actor george <UNK> jr and wonderful sets convey a realistic feeling of early immigrant <UNK> in new york these give this <UNK> film an authenticity which is unusual in features of this vintage br br the film begins with the modern day and a man george <UNK> in modern clothes reading a story about an italian immigrant and then we transition into the story with george playing the immigrant he raises enough money to bring his fianc√©e from italy to america marries her and has a son with her but times are hard and the family struggles to survive i found myself wondering why the mother didn't <UNK> her child and avoid the complications with the dirty formula but oh well even the early dream factory was pushing political correct behaviour for women in <UNK> br br the best scene in the picture is when <UNK> has a chance to seek revenge on a crime boss who inadvertently put him in jail and at the last minute he decides against his planned course of action very neat i loved the curtain effect it was great wonderful use of lighting in this film br br i give the italian an 8 out of 10
<START> i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horror movies and i really liked this one there were so many <UNK> scenes what's the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when <UNK> walking without her <UNK> the make up is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without make up and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared
<START> while watching the film i'm not sure what <UNK> it was to take there's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well you can't do it all i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats ms <UNK> is the film to add to her amazing talents her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged here is a british actress who can do anything in my view conflict is what makes drama and a great story i felt this film didn't have that everything was somewhat easy for the characters there were no real obstacles <UNK> the <UNK> from getting what they wanted watch the film for the <UNK> but most of all for ms <UNK> brilliant performance
<START> steven spielberg at 24 had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called the psychiatrist starring roy <UNK> one episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12 year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man <UNK> <UNK> in his best performance who is dying of cancer both episodes were stunning visually unlike anything else on tv and emotionally complex and adult the creators of the psychiatrist were richard <UNK> and william link who created columbo and also produced its first season br br peter falk insisted on first rank experienced tv directors for the first season of columbo like bernard <UNK> and jack <UNK> but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the <UNK> <UNK> episode of the psychiatrist br br spielberg says on the dvd of duel that he loved steven <UNK> murder by the book script based on a <UNK> link story and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature even thought he had a lot less money to work with br br this episode of columbo is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other columbo episode even though the series always used top directors spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from <UNK> it up too much but both actors are still a lot of fun spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and barbara <UNK> all the performances have a <UNK> and <UNK> about them the only columbo episode that was close to being as well directed is the by <UNK> early light episode with patrick <UNK> directed by harvey hart br br i think the two episodes of the psychiatrist and this episode of columbo suggest spielberg hasn't developed technically all that much as a director he was great from the beginning in a combat dvd commentary of a <UNK> episode guest starring albert <UNK> robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director maybe the same is true of spielberg
<START> there are pretty landscape shots writers putting trite <UNK> into actors mouths with lesser actors this show would be silly <UNK> must <UNK> humanity or it's <UNK> ' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side the lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side wrong he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not <UNK> his <UNK> with something other than landscapes there wasn't a breathing <UNK> in his work nor expression of his pain all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes the discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie i was moved only once towards the end the kid was way too passive the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous just my opinion but nowhere show for me
<START> yes this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre still i did not like this one at all about a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life crappy sex scenes to follow why are they crappy for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act i mean we watch porn for the sex do we not little girls blue also does things in an artistic way but it is still very erotic and nice to look at of course the girls in that one are very cute here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things if you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film the sex scenes range from <UNK> to bizarre i mean there is a snake in one of them people so for me this movie just fails as it does not <UNK> me at all but rather turns me off
<START> bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for 2 i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one br br the movie is quite cliche 1970's and is quite <UNK> for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was br br the movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and wait for them br br if you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line either br br
<START> i couldn't wait to receive the dvd after hearing so much about the film what a disappointment this became one of the most confusing films i've ever viewed there were so many characters introduced some resembling others that it became impossible to follow the story line i could not understand how george clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved at least in the first half of the movie my wife and i gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the dvd i might have considered fast <UNK> to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim a co worker told me that a lot of the movie comes together in the last minute or less i was glad i didn't waste another hour waiting i gave the dvd away the following day
<START> i think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made and i've seen many the book is better but it's still a very good movie
<START> i love this movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i'd like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing <UNK> du <UNK> is it still i heard it was to be <UNK> has been used for the movie the whole scene has been <UNK> on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin <UNK> for several weeks
<START> possible spoilers although done before and better in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> palace still strikes a <UNK> with me br br here we have the tale of two young girls who travel through thailand and get arrested on charges of <UNK> drugs was it <UNK> <UNK> alice was it kate <UNK> <UNK> was it the handsome stranger whom they met on their journey none of that really matters for this is a tale of friendship and trust and the limits they can be stretched to throw in bill <UNK> as an <UNK> lawyer and <UNK> kim as his <UNK> bride and better lawyer than he is and we have a nice little story that holds the audience's attention br br <UNK> palace is nothing extraordinary or notorious for any reason it is not an original concept it doesn't show <UNK> violence that leads to the wannabe avant garde crowd talking about it's gritty realism or hard hitting truths it is merely a good story with some fine performances bill <UNK> is weakest with his lazy <UNK> and <UNK> way of talking i was quite bored with the character br br kate beckinsale while decent is nothing spectacular she acts well but it's not exactly a memorable performance br br <UNK> kim however is in fine form <UNK> a likable and defined character where really there is not much to work with br br but make no mistake this is <UNK> <UNK> movie i've long been a fan of her work and this is no change she <UNK> in every scene she appears and were it not for her the film would probably <UNK> into boring fare i particularly applaud her performance in the scene between her and <UNK> father br br the film also has a brilliant soundtrack br br 7 out of 10
<START> the entire thing is very beautiful to look at the european location shooting was a good idea the lead actors are attractive the score is <UNK> br br but then they spoke and the non plot developed and it was all downhill from there pacino is <UNK> and <UNK> keeps talking about how bored she is hello dear you're not alone when he does a mae west imitation you might have to hide your face its that painful to watch br br i can't imagine how either actor or director sydney <UNK> got involved with this or a better question why it ended up <UNK> so bad br br since death is represented in almost every scene one way or another maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death but i still can't recommend it
<START> there's tons of good looking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudity free <UNK> strike one br br <UNK> one story in this film takes place in 1971 then why the hell are the main characters driving a <UNK> <UNK> hello continuity anyone br br as you might know this movie was released in <UNK> 3d and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen i'm not sure if someone <UNK> the job on this but there was no 3d just double vision <UNK> i didn't have the same problem with this <UNK> other 3d movies hunting season and camp blood sure the 3d in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect br br this thing is a big ball of nothing br br and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear eating dame <UNK> i'd like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet <UNK> at a young age <UNK> br br
<START> this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece <UNK> crap i have ever watched br br this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father <UNK> sex while he was dressed as santa <UNK> that is why he went insane is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever and that's not the only thing i'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by br br there's an entire <UNK> scene where he <UNK> a <UNK> santa beard on to him it's a <UNK> minute long who the hell wants to see that however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history and i'm serious about that br br it's not even so good its bad it's tedious it's idiotic it made me want to break the vcr it's just not worth your time also i'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second you want to know how bad this movie is i'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again
<START> have you ever or do you have a pet who's been with you through thick and thin who you'd be lost without and who you love no matter what <UNK> never thought they feel the same way about you br br wonderful wonderful family film if you have a soft spot for animals this is guaranteed to make you cry no matter your age i used to watch this movie all the time when i was a little kid and i find that now at age sixteen i love it as much as i did then i could never decide on a favorite character then and i still don't think i can i love all three of the animals the dialogue seems very real and comfortable like a loving but <UNK> family i do love chance and how at the end he says that he has a family at last cheesy yes but one must remember that this is meant to be a family film and it <UNK> that role perfectly sassy has just the perfect dose of <UNK> and shadow is the perfect leader role model to the young adventurous chance br br the animals way <UNK> the humans but of course most of the <UNK> moments are to be had during an interaction with them ie <UNK> molly and the end not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives each moment even more emotion and an accompanying heart <UNK> feeling i give this 9 10 to be compared to and even rated better than cats and dogs and babe
<START> a possible spoiler or two br br soul survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever nothing makes sense at all there's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together by the end of the film br br <UNK> acting is non existent the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing it just makes the movie even harder to watch br br i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came definitely the worst film of the year 1 2 stars
<START> yes this is one of those movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing i have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie the other comments give the idea well enough the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose <UNK> school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses br br but the rat yes the big rat why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me often the <UNK> <UNK> isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money i <UNK> however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a <UNK> with third world <UNK> br br the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene after <UNK> out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise <UNK> from the bad acting the main dude <UNK> up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy if you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats <UNK> while blood <UNK> out of their heads like a <UNK> this film is for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself br br but not for more than <UNK> ok
<START> holes is an awesome movie i love it a lot and it's one of my favorite films it's one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn't cheesy holes is generally a very cool motion picture i wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed a rare breed of disney <UNK> shows that is cool don't get the wrong idea i don't mean to bad mouth disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and that's okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes it's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny really it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young <UNK> might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to br br holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this
<START> spoilers <UNK> slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black <UNK> and wearing what looks like a pull over peter lorre rubber mask were told early in the movie almost the very first scene that young beth morgan was in <UNK> due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in <UNK> <UNK> about a year ago br br it's also brought out that fbi agent <UNK> jeff <UNK> who's obsessed in catching the killer daughter was also murdered in <UNK> around the same time by the time the movie do you wanna know a secret is over it's never explained just what those two killings back in <UNK> has to do with the slaughter in florida of some half dozen <UNK> students a year later other that the killer at least in the murder of <UNK> boyfriend wore the same silly halloween outfit br br at spring break in the sunshine state the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time starting with computer geek brad <UNK> <UNK> allen the killing even <UNK> over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief <UNK> jack <UNK> getting <UNK> open br br the masked killer saves beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church in what looks like the florida <UNK> he then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does none trying to scare it's audience all the movie does is confuse and <UNK> it with a number of not too convincing slasher scenes the most effective ones having the victim oz washington tom jay jones survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up together with agent <UNK> the hero in the film br br oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large <UNK> of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously <UNK> after getting arrested for a murder he didn't commit in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk it also made no sense at all why oz and beth went on their own to <UNK> down and catch the killer instead of calling the police with a <UNK> that oz had instead br br <UNK> boyfriend who loses his head over her in the movie hank ford joseph lawrence is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house they together with with beth oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight for a moment you didn't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of <UNK> on <UNK> or the local police part until the off the wall final scene where they popped up in the church br br we also get an insight on a previous relationship between tina and hank with her drunk and acting obnoxious trying to get it on with hank as beth walks in without hank and tina even <UNK> her that seemed to have upset beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie
<START> here is the explanation screenwriter pamela <UNK> gave me for why <UNK> introduced <UNK> as a specific character in the film br br the historical record is very clear joseph <UNK> was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners so we needed a way to get <UNK> himself into our film for a woman like lena a woman from an <UNK> family with connections it wasn't <UNK> that she would make an attempt to go to the top the idea of getting to <UNK> wasn't impossible for her so that became our hook br br those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below then fire away br br jan lisa <UNK> films for two
<START> i love occult horror and the great british hammer studios who delivered one of their greatest films with the devil rides out 1968 have proved to be more than capable in this field of horror this occult <UNK> episode of <UNK> short running tv series hammer house of horror 1980 guardian of the <UNK> is indeed a creepy entry to the series director don sharp who had previously <UNK> the hammer <UNK> with the kiss of the vampire 1963 and <UNK> the mad monk 1966 and furthermore directed two fu <UNK> movies starring christopher lee is <UNK> one of the better known names among the <UNK> directors and he also delivers here <UNK> dealer michael ray <UNK> stumbles over a mysterious old <UNK> glass the <UNK> glass happens to be the object of desire of a devil <UNK> cult who want to use it for their satanic <UNK> when he <UNK> a beautiful young girl named allison <UNK> <UNK> who is to be sacrificed by the cult michael gets into deeper trouble with the cult and their sinister leader john carson while this is not one of my absolute favorite episodes of hammer house of horror the best one clearly is the brilliant seventh episode the silent scream it is a very creepy and atmospheric one the plot has several interesting twists and stays suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film ray <UNK> makes a good lead young <UNK> <UNK> is convincing as the innocent beauty and john carson is truly creepy as the leader of the <UNK> overall guardian of the <UNK> is another interesting and creepy <UNK> tale and my fellow hammer fans should not miss it
<START> the woman in black is easily one of the <UNK> british ghost stories ever made a young <UNK> after arriving in a small town to handle a dead <UNK> estate is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black the film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the <UNK> are <UNK> for and deliver the maximum effect possible the action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing the acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times so if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look i dare anyone to watch the woman in black alone at night with the lights off highly recommended 10 out of 10
<START> this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my <UNK> without even reading the cover let alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds <UNK> the sexual tension that <UNK> between a secretary and a criminal is almost <UNK> even without hardly any physical contact toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply <UNK> their passion <UNK> could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional 100 minutes would have been plenty i'm <UNK> though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library <UNK> this movie restored my faith in great film making
<START> first this film is not a thriller neither is it gripping taut it might have been so based on the script but the <UNK> slow pace makes it difficult to get into br br the plot itself is very interesting and ingenious unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over that leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them <UNK> by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer and cunning <UNK> scenes that <UNK> a little more overt intelligence br br i wish this had been the fast paced thriller the box promised it would've been an outstanding film instead spike lee made it <UNK> along through the end
<START> what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago which i still keep thinking about the back cover doesn't do this film justice it's superb and in my top 5 for sure
<START> this movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history right up there with ed <UNK> <UNK> defense of cross dressing in <UNK> or glenda br br the subject playing bridge the park <UNK> set plays it the <UNK> play it the russians who speak very questionable russian and have most unconvincing accents when they speak english play it at the restaurant where they work br br if one isn't interested in bridge one even despite the great cast isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie br br loretta young and paul lukas are fine well frank <UNK> is an unlikely ghost writer as lukas is an unlikely russian but they are all sunk by the <UNK> script
<START> i am extremely <UNK> about the films i see i'd heard about moon child completely by accident i've been a fan of <UNK> en <UNK> for some time and a fan of gackt and <UNK> only recently br br i finally found out the film was being re released and picked it up without a second thought br br being as critical as i am about films i will admit the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times but they're meant too be as another user suggested it's the quintessential calm before the storm <UNK> gary <UNK> from leon without getting into the spoilers the film hit me extremely hard because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are <UNK> and as they often say true friendship is loyalty and like marriage it's until death do you part br br hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an <UNK> film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally br br upon seeing the film for the first time i realized it will probably remain in heavy <UNK> as far as my collection goes i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film this takes an entirely new direction using classic <UNK> film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from <UNK> <UNK> of takashi miike's audition and suicide club fame br br man i just can't say enough about this film but i'll stop here br br 10 10
<START> resident evil code <UNK> is a great well made video game it has great graphics very comfortable controls a great storyline and high fun factor the storyline to this is claire <UNK> gets taken to an island for <UNK> on <UNK> grounds and <UNK> havoc at they're main lab while looking for her brother code <UNK> graphics are very good the fire and rain effects are great looking the controls are <UNK> but the button pattern <UNK> fit the <UNK> control <UNK> it hard to get used to its still fun going around some <UNK> disturbing place shooting the guts out of zombies code <UNK> also has a little bit of romance between the two main characters you also get to play as chris <UNK> from resident evil 1 the sound in this game is better than ever for example even though i hate the new feature when the giant <UNK> crawl they're feet make a disturbing <UNK> sound and the guns sound alot more realistic great graphics outstanding story <UNK> controls and realistic sound makes resident evil code <UNK> a definite loved i give it a 10 out of 10
<START> i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been <UNK> in the history of the world in the name of religion and it seems that the <UNK> of the catholic church in <UNK> century ireland rank right up there near the top considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some <UNK> effect br br a love divided is the story of a real family <UNK> by ignorant <UNK> and prejudice all in the name of an inane church <UNK> at the beginning of the film we are offered a view of the <UNK> life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean <UNK> are happily married with two young children sean is catholic and sheila is <UNK> but she has no <UNK> with their children being raised as catholic there is no sign of any <UNK> between the <UNK> and <UNK> in the village the peaceful and loving relationships are soon <UNK> when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the <UNK> school the local priest takes it upon himself to <UNK> this sin and soon has <UNK> husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father the local <UNK> farmer in an act of <UNK> and desperation sheila kidnaps her two daughters and <UNK> from the area br br special note should be given to <UNK> brady who plays sheila she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her <UNK> desire to establish herself as independent from the <UNK> of the establishment on an equal <UNK> is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community br br if fiction this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama considering it is true it changes to a horrific tragedy in real life the people and the village never fully <UNK> from the events that took place there it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area they never fully <UNK> from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers br br whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice crashing planes into buildings <UNK> women <UNK> whole races or just plain on torture and murder we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society
<START> this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene i think the <UNK> <UNK> did it for me or better yet her talking tongue or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> caught in his throat decisions decisions
<START> this <UNK> <UNK> thing was dated in 1976 it seems particularly mean spirited now filled with gay stereotypes and characters that are meant to be laughed at rather than with <UNK> foxx does his standard <UNK> michael warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character and pearl pearl what were you thinking pearl <UNK> deserves far better
<START> fantastic mr fox is a comedy based on the classic <UNK> <UNK> book wes anderson directs and <UNK> takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film while i respect what anderson an incredibly talented man did the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man and if this happened to be a bad film it would be his first bad film just like when you go to school and have your first bad day this is <UNK> first bad day in film making so i am going to let him off easy i will admit it did have a <UNK> and nice spirit to it and the animation is nice but the film gets <UNK> harder to get into leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening the characters are good also jason <UNK> voices mr fox george clooney 's smart ass son ash and especially engaging the film does not quite make it up to a level of <UNK> but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along i'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film but for now i'm sorry wes anderson this film of yours was a big disappointment
<START> i found this movie to be exciting right from the start like a spielberg movie is and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was br br right from the start before the opening credits the action starts bringing with it immediate suspense br br the two main characters are very likable i have trouble liking any of the <UNK> due to <UNK> extra <UNK> political activities but william was not too bad in this movie br br there were several highly unexpected twists which contributed to the enjoyment br br there were unfortunately many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack something like <UNK> <UNK> i suspect the <UNK> was picking up video <UNK> on the set
<START> if you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the things bruce <UNK> on his fellow <UNK> the deleted scenes are priceless i don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie it can't be because of time since the movie is only 101 minutes long morgan freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long jim carrey needs <UNK>
<START> this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who don't understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three <UNK> sitting on my dvd rack next to <UNK> and kurosawa it <UNK> the recognition of absurdity and <UNK> all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single <UNK> opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of <UNK> by now i'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now
<START> i knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the movie's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that <UNK> gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the <UNK> sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop <UNK> products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but i'm glad i didn't spend 9 50 to see it in the theater
<START> <UNK> does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to <UNK> this entry is filled with the requisite <UNK> ray moore <UNK> humor and martial arts <UNK> <UNK> a crazy red neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where <UNK> <UNK> down a <UNK> hill see it for laughs and for a brain <UNK> hit of <UNK> magic
<START> i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released in all <UNK> episodes so far the best one is definitely episode 3 denial anger acceptance this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos his name was brendan <UNK> he was killed for <UNK> the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang in the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos brendan <UNK> is 1 for me and my 2 most favorite character ever was matthew <UNK> who was killed after attempting to murder christopher <UNK> tony and <UNK> shoot him in <UNK> park after they catch and torture him my 3 most favorite character is sean <UNK> who was killed right after shooting christopher and finally my 4 most favorite character is <UNK> <UNK> one of uncle <UNK> henchmen he was killed on a boat by tony all the awesome characters are dead that's the only bad thing about the sopranos all the cool guys always get killed you know what would be great to change about the sopranos they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris tony uncle junior <UNK> and paulie because they need to get their revenge brendan <UNK> shall strike back 1
<START> fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any <UNK> all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp of course in the real world no genius <UNK> would even glance at some grease monkey but that is why i love romantic comedies one can just totally forget reality and have a good time nice film damn meg is a babe eh
<START> some time in the late 19th century somewhere in the american west several <UNK> in need of money go on a buffalo hunt the <UNK> leader believes that <UNK> are too numerous for the hunting to have any impact but the more experienced hunter has seen how quickly the population can collapse and he isn't so sure featuring buffalo <UNK> living in south <UNK> and showing film of actual hunting the movie's introduction explains it as necessary <UNK> of the herd the movie does an excellent job of presenting us with the plight of the buffalo and its effect on native americans without ever getting preachy about it br br the real story however is about the dysfunctional family which is created by the small group formed to do the hunting the father figure is charlie a violent man with a short <UNK> sandy his brother is the experienced hunter who is tired of killing but needs the job after losing his cattle a half indian boy who hates the fact that he looks entirely <UNK> takes the role of adopted son the grandfather and moral <UNK> is an alcoholic buffalo <UNK> charlie's wife is an indian woman whose companions he killed after they stole his horses br br charlie is clearly the most interesting figure he is mean and insulting towards everyone around him yet at the same time he knows that they are the only family and friends that he has he expects the <UNK> indian women to hate him then accept him but he doesn't know how to react when she refuses to do either he's the one who put the family together in the first place but he's also the one who is <UNK> to ultimately destroy it br br this is all very similar to the classic red river which also features a family of sorts being torn apart by the increasingly violent and <UNK> father figure as one might expect this movie suffers by comparison the plot is not as focused on developing the characters and family dynamics and the direction fails to keep all of the scenes working towards this common goal charlie is so thoroughly unlikable from the very beginning that we never have any reason to care about what happens to him or his family on the positive side however the message surrounding the buffalo slaughter adds an extra dimension to the film and its conclusion is far superior to the hollywood ending which was tacked on to the end of red river as a result the last hunt is an interesting and entertaining film very well made but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a classic
<START> for all of the hype about this film i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think and although a bit slow at times the first 90 of the movie is quite good with more than a few old time scares that make one <UNK> and <UNK> i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes where dark remains fails however is in its climax the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and the answer i was seeking most what really happened to emma was not <UNK> upon the <UNK> for the negative energy was ludicrous at best and in the end i felt very cheated what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending
<START> documentary about <UNK> <UNK> making a <UNK> <UNK> of massive mountains to get their <UNK> to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oriental music score that could not have been used in the original <UNK> is even <UNK> than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved <UNK> of the north and march of the <UNK> but <UNK> this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical <UNK> alone are just not that interesting
<START> i agree with what <UNK> wrote with regards to the <UNK> feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans <UNK> sings it's <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> in his role nail nailed it <UNK> was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet <UNK> performance was gorgeous the scenes between <UNK> robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought to i've told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy <UNK> character it's supposed to be rock roll not the phantom of the f g opera
<START> spoilers br br i <UNK> figured the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was i thought wild <UNK> was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen this one is much worse makes no sense thrown together plot all so we can see <UNK> breasts on a figure that doesn't support them br br it had to of been a student film that <UNK> gotten a c grade br br 2 10 br br quality 1 10 entertainment 6 10 until i found out it wasn't going to end the ending made no darn sense br br <UNK> 0 10
<START> cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw and to me it is timeless it is a lovely looking film with gorgeous animation my favourite animation scene was the dress scene i just love those mice the songs are also lovely not as good as snow <UNK> but they are a delight to sing and are reminiscent of <UNK> a dream is a wish and so this is love are <UNK> the characters are also a delight cinderella is idealistic and strong and the mice provided great comic relief the <UNK> were also well done as well as <UNK> but i loved the stepmother the best she was really evil in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy <UNK> it is true the movie drags slightly with the antics of the mice but they were genuinely funny so i don't care i don't think it is overrated underrated don't you mean it rarely plays on television but the really bad sequel does on <UNK> on a regular basis if you want a great cinderella adaptation try the wonderful ever after or the lavish <UNK> and the rose which isn't as good but whatever you do avoid the sequel which i have the mistake of <UNK> because you'll thank me 9 10 <UNK> cox
<START> in light of the recent and quite good batman the brave and the bold now is the time to bear a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of batman being a huge fan since the first revival by tim burton 20 years ago i have been able to accept different <UNK> in the character dark or campy this one is just not credible too many effects poor <UNK> and so few questions what is great about batman is the diversity of his skills and aspects of his personality detective crime fighter playboy <UNK> etc the batman shows him only in his karate days and by the way how come the penguin is capable of such <UNK> when jumping in the air regardless of his <UNK> <UNK> and look at the joker a mixture of <UNK> in street fighter 2 and a stereotypical <UNK> man what batman fan could accept such a <UNK> not me anyway batman is much better without the article in front of his name
<START> avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie example the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear a <UNK> sin in a french film br br this film attempts to combine western drug intrigue and <UNK> regime costume epic what well consider this the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed br br someone should do a <UNK> up tiger <UNK> on this bomb rewrite the script and then either dub or <UNK> it heck it's almost that now btw gerard depardieu and carole <UNK> both known to american audiences have roles
<START> this movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen br br four of the more important mexican directors of the last times approach <UNK> of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a <UNK> tone him br br with actors little known but that <UNK> of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased but i consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the <UNK> of the mexican
<START> i sat glued to the screen <UNK> <UNK> yet keeping an <UNK> eye i waited for the next awful special effect or the next ridiculously clich√©d plot item to show up full force so i could learn how not to make a movie br br it seems when they set out to make this movie the crew watched every single other action science fiction shoot em up good vs evil movie ever made and saw cool things and said hey we can do that for example the only car <UNK> within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking is the one car the protagonist an attractive brunette born of <UNK> is thrown on to the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it the special effects were quite obviously my biggest <UNK> with this movie but what really put it in my bad books was the <UNK> and lack of reason for so many elements for example the antagonist a flying demon with the ability to <UNK> harm in bizarre ways happens upon a lone army truck <UNK> an important <UNK> <UNK> security guys with guns get out of the truck you know they are already dead then the guy protecting the <UNK> says under no circumstances do you leave this truck do you understand me he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies he gets whacked in an almost <UNK> clich√© fashion then for no apparent reason <UNK> logic convention and common sense the dumb ass <UNK> gets out of the truck a lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn't make sense transparent acting <UNK> me from the movie as well as bad camera work and things that just make you go wow that's incredibly cheesy <UNK> <UNK> saved the movie from a 1 because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience sex appeal
<START> i loved it and was so <UNK> that there not making another season i wish they would it was the best show ever there's probably not any chance of them deciding to not <UNK> the show is there ha ha i wish there was though i would be so so excited i really would i miss it and was especially <UNK> not to know what happens to jason i think they should make another one it i also think its silly that u have to <UNK> ten lines to post a comment it makes your comment drag on and no one will read it i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole maybe they could make a spin off
<START> i cannot stay indifferent to lars van <UNK> films i consider <UNK> the <UNK> nothing less than a masterpiece i loved <UNK> in the <UNK> i admired the idea in <UNK> but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema <UNK> which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and <UNK> exercise in cinema art to my taste br br the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of <UNK> and <UNK> of <UNK> and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a <UNK> event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of <UNK> even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task br br the film seems to include a lot of quotes <UNK> directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the pre war europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and <UNK> here the train also becomes the symbol of the first <UNK> of the re birth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> the characters that <UNK> the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post war europe willing to be part of a process of help and <UNK> finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with <UNK> looking more like oppressive <UNK> with the <UNK> not <UNK> to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self destruction with love <UNK> mixed with <UNK> br br it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold <UNK> played by jean marc <UNK> seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s the usage of color over the black and white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too <UNK> it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too <UNK> he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone
<START> this movie is another christian propaganda film in the line of the <UNK> code not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver if you enjoy a <UNK> portrayal of life on the streets and the way the <UNK> can change a life than perhaps you may enjoy this movie i say save your money and rent the cross and the <UNK> or the mission when will christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words it was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear huh criminals say bad words and flat characters i really could not relate to also it would've been great if the movie had shown some t a now that would be something i'd like to pay to see who was the <UNK> who compared this <UNK> <UNK> thin story of a movie with the <UNK> saints and the <UNK>
<START> otto <UNK> dana andrews cycle of films <UNK> are among the largely <UNK> <UNK> of the genre because they lack paranoia <UNK> or <UNK> they may have seemed out of place at the time but the clear eyed imagery the complex play with identity <UNK> and representation the <UNK> of traditional psychological <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> style all seem <UNK> modern today and very similar to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of this film are so loaded brutal and ironic that the <UNK> ending is one of the <UNK> in hollywood history brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller as well tense and packed with double edged dialogue
<START> very interesting and moving documentary about the world trade center tragedy on <UNK> september 2001 the main theme of it is the <UNK> of american fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could the film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives recommended
<START> there is one great moment in surviving christmas that almost makes it worth the pain james gandolfini cracks a <UNK> over ben <UNK> stupid head br br this movie serves as yet another unfortunate example of james gandolfini proving what a great actor he is whilst simultaneously <UNK> his career by acting in this film br br young and wealthy ad <UNK> drew <UNK> ben affleck has been <UNK> into believing that one must never be alone on christmas and there from the outset is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie how many people of <UNK> social standing in 2004 truly care one way or another whether christmas is spent alone or with half the family or with a fifty dollar prostitute storyline finds drew buying off a family to spend christmas with on the condition that they pretend to be his own <UNK> ignoring all the <UNK> to the contrary that his money has not bought the emotions he was seeking br br for 250 000 a <UNK> suburban truck driver tom <UNK> james gandolfini and his <UNK> wife christine catherine o'hara agree to be <UNK> ad <UNK> family against <UNK> from their son brian a very one dimensional josh <UNK> and daughter alicia a very soft focused christina <UNK> drew then spends the rest of the movie supposedly <UNK> his youth or something the messages in this movie are as twisted and illogical as its dry mouthed storyline <UNK> with overt <UNK> drew <UNK> a fake smile on his face and <UNK> remains in denial against every <UNK> that he was supposedly buying the <UNK> family to avoid br br which begs the question if drew is paying these people to <UNK> some semblance of <UNK> <UNK> emotion how psychotic must he be to pretend happiness amongst their <UNK> and mental anguish over his presence it is not a case of the <UNK> family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy while around drew three of the four members make it <UNK> clear they despise him is he so <UNK> that he cannot see that his money is not buying him the family atmosphere he was <UNK> into believing was a truth in the first place as with all movies this <UNK> one wonders how four screenwriters could possibly get so <UNK> in their own <UNK> dreams of appearing in a credits sequence that they will overlook any semblance of <UNK> or intelligence br br director mike mitchell who was responsible for <UNK> <UNK> male <UNK> stop right there <UNK> said br br gandolfini and o'hara somehow manage to shine proving their <UNK> amongst this mess christina <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> and blond and fiery in all the right places <UNK> cutting drew into little <UNK> of <UNK> for most of the movie then doing an about face and falling in love with him because the script tells her to br br and i wouldn't go so far as to say that affleck is a bad actor but john schneider better look over his shoulder there's a whole new level of desperately seeking talent in town
<START> i actually had quite high hopes going into this movie so i took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best about 1 3 of the way through the film i simply had to give up quite simply the movie is a <UNK> mash of stuff happening for no apparent reason and it's all <UNK> i love movies that make you think but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected br br don't think it's david lynch esquire as some would have you believe it is nowhere near that realm other than some <UNK> visuals saying it's artsy to disguise the fact there's no apparent plot or story is just a manner or <UNK> why you wasted the 1 5 hours in the film the acting was good but that cannot save lack of story i do agree with the one comment posted previously it's like being in some other person's head while they're on drugs in other words nothing makes sense
<START> a bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director robert <UNK> and ella raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and <UNK> tone as a crazed and murderous <UNK> as well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by elisha cook jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy if you're used to seeing raines in more wholesome parts she's allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with cook <UNK> tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts <UNK> while the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting
<START> i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to br br having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it br br from what i remember it's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the 13th and are stalked by <UNK> of wood man br br some people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want <UNK> for the missing time in my life br br i will pay u <UNK> to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend
<START> as a <UNK> of sorts to the <UNK> top 100 films the british film <UNK> worked out a documentary with martin scorsese br br now i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am <UNK> in <UNK> with my idol in this fantastic though long documentary scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the gangster film and the noir full of <UNK> enthusiasm martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor
<START> i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in <UNK> <UNK> i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an <UNK> screening br br when i think of the films that are shown at festivals i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat often with the feel of an elaborate student project there's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film making by mainstream i mean more like a film produced for national release in other words a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater br br the writing directing cinematography casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro there is nothing typically independent about this film as an aspiring director i am always looking for movies that will <UNK> me to stop <UNK> and push harder to get my career going this is one of those films as i watched the big bad swim my motivation level was incredible i felt like my <UNK> had kicked in the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put off project when a movie makes me feel like that i know it's really good this is the first feature length project from <UNK> <UNK> and i found myself wishing that it had been my project for me that's really rare br br see this film it's beautifully shot and directed and the casting is excellent <UNK> <UNK> delivers a very believable and likable performance she has a quality about her a charisma that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend that's a gift i think the industry is really missing out by not <UNK> her acting abilities more often jeff <UNK> and jess <UNK> also did top notch jobs i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production
<START> the director states in the behind the scenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to <UNK> <UNK> as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically <UNK> this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother's day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood 18 year old <UNK> that's right he's been in high school for 22 years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn haha get it and his girlfriend just goes oh my god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing <UNK> off cars and calling people losers br br the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesn't br br if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really <UNK> song dude
<START> the perfect son is a story about two 30 something brothers one who is seemingly perfect and the other who is basically a screw up frequently landing himself in drug <UNK> centers after the death of their father the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry <UNK> it isn't until the perfect brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order and take some responsibility br br the movie does a nice job of <UNK> the younger brother's comeback though it may seem a bit far fetched at times beating drug addiction is never so easy what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids a topic that has become somewhat <UNK> in cinema over the last 5 10 years and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two <UNK> <UNK> brothers is very believable and well done the two main actors were both very competent if not terribly charismatic br br a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard <UNK> whose own brother died of aids the ending is nicely done as well br br
<START> i have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels 1963 song my <UNK> back if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work i would suggest the dental work
<START> before dogma 95 when lars used movies as art not just a story a beautiful painting about love and death this is one of my favorite movies of all time the color the music just perfect
<START> since my third or fourth viewing some time ago i've <UNK> from la <UNK> et la <UNK> while i wait for the dvd in the meantime i've read the french screenplay as well as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on jean <UNK> the latter ends with a frustrating filmography eleven films fiction doc and in between impossible to see or in the cases of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and le <UNK> <UNK> re see br br a few questions that hit me this moment polish <UNK> french is plenty <UNK> un maximum <UNK> un maximum <UNK> even so does she have an accent i think i can tell she does what does the absence of color add especially at the single spot the <UNK> of the city is <UNK> how does this <UNK> <UNK> from the sleep and journey that <UNK> worlds of the <UNK> and the <UNK> tale <UNK> <UNK> we may imagine the <UNK> years since have done it but does <UNK> deliberately <UNK> the film's <UNK> is this an enchanted <UNK> is <UNK> a fairy tale <UNK> always <UNK> himself worrying about how or where to stand or walk what to say when <UNK> these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does or is this his way of trying to <UNK> others by doing it to himself how different is he from <UNK> <UNK> i say i think very what's the difference and is there one between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> how different is the present <UNK> isn't he still doing it whatever it is in recent roles <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> whatever approaching old age once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> films for a long while every three or five minutes down the <UNK> would come a twenty something male in <UNK> <UNK> coat <UNK> hair with a direction seeking nose i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious <UNK> i was that age but have no idea what i myself looked like then no <UNK> at least i do have a brother though who seems to have learned his <UNK> from <UNK>
<START> i see where a few people involved in this <UNK> wrote reviews to share their side of the story and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it the fact that they basically came up with excuses <UNK> budget constraints production <UNK> etc simply <UNK> how bad this movie is and my criticisms in <UNK> it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut br br it's watchable but barely so there are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is <UNK> a mile away the <UNK> interesting feature of a <UNK> <UNK> with a <UNK> team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy would ya <UNK> us up some <UNK> <UNK> sally between us getting killed by these <UNK> carpet <UNK> apparently this elite team <UNK> with the latest <UNK> and red plastic <UNK> wonder armor has no access to <UNK> once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone br br the <UNK> for the encounter with the <UNK> <UNK> is that it can't be killed single <UNK> yet only one scene ago the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that huh vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie but that's not saying much
<START> who in the world told harrison ford that this was a good role for him br br and josh <UNK> how does a 19 year old who can't fire a gun become a cop over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film
<START> this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so <UNK> this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely <UNK> ruined and everyone is <UNK> in the con could anything be more true br br don't miss the soundtrack it is wonderful
<START> i viewed the movie together with a <UNK> friend my wife and her female friend so i had views from all kinds of directions mainly the film made me laugh the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were <UNK> <UNK> and maria <UNK> yes i do think she played her role well even if the script was not appropriate there were good romanian actors around they just didn't have complex roles i applaud <UNK> entering the movie business i don't know why but i think he's a good guy i just hope he'll be a good actor br br the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been <UNK> being played and to which i had no ear for if the film tried to present <UNK> sexual <UNK> and their consequences in todays romania then it failed miserably there were no consequences just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl and the same story becomes just a boring uninteresting plot br br i have no idea why it got all those <UNK> awards in my book it should have gotten the better luck next time award <UNK> good luck in romanian
<START> i saw this movie twice i can't believe <UNK> made such a fantasy movie i'm also a movie theatre director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty images br br what most of <UNK> don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers <UNK> should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the <UNK> <UNK> said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from <UNK>
<START> this installment of masters of horror was terrible apparently mr carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about pacing and decent plausible dialog there were times when i literally <UNK> at the tv for something to happen maybe he thinks he building suspense but carpenter needs to <UNK> back that overdone over <UNK> musical score of his or his son's and advance the action a little bit how many times did the girl say oh no i can't have this baby and oh no here it comes carpenter takes elements from much much better films assault on <UNK> 13 and the thing and throws them in here as if we are supposed to acknowledge and appreciate his trademark style what is lacking here is genuine suspense and energy it's as though he's <UNK> through the process of movie making br br for better carpenter films stick to the tried and true classics the thing halloween and they live for better masters of horror episodes check out my personal favorites family <UNK> and dreams in the witch house
<START> quite simply the best reality show ever made the first two seasons the only ones that matter are on <UNK> i challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it i guarantee you will finish watching the season then i guarantee that you will watch season 2 br br other quick reasons to watch it 1 anderson cooper is hilarious 2 the locations in europe are awesome 3 the games are mentally challenging 4 it's very <UNK> 5 in one episode a player responds to another <UNK> desperate i'm trying as hard as i can with an equally desperate not necessarily br br can you figure out who is the mole
<START> the pre release version of <UNK> baby face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate <UNK> on sexual <UNK> <UNK> by a <UNK> professor lily powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's <UNK> to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank because each <UNK> of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his <UNK> locked in the vault the film has no victims except <UNK> childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father the destructive relationship with her father suggests <UNK> hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate while lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly <UNK> wives and <UNK> to trade jobs for sexual <UNK> perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's <UNK> less to <UNK> than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women br br the plot moves fast and the camera <UNK> moves from window to window up the <UNK> of the office building as lily climbs ever higher barbara stanwyck <UNK> in tough hard bitten roles and she is in top form here sentiment does not <UNK> when she is ready to climb the next <UNK> only her african american <UNK> <UNK> receives <UNK> affection trust and loyalty in more <UNK> times the fresh natural beauty of <UNK> harris who plays <UNK> would have had the men throwing the <UNK> and <UNK> at her stanwyck often appears overly made up and <UNK> <UNK> in comparison to harris however despite <UNK> tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial <UNK> she manages to leave a trail of <UNK> and <UNK> men including <UNK> <UNK> donald cook and a young john wayne br br the preferred version of baby face is the <UNK> minute restored cut the edited release version of the film <UNK> turns from the hard facts which the longer cut <UNK> and makes explicit perhaps <UNK> <UNK> who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by <UNK> from <UNK> whose views on women were controversial however despite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and advice not to be defeated by life <UNK> grab for power and money likely <UNK> more to her upbringing and her father than to her <UNK> mentor however the philosophy is but a distraction short fast paced and entertaining baby face is as contemporary in its morality as wall street substitute gordon <UNK> for <UNK> and lily could have <UNK> her <UNK> philosophy to be greed is good
<START> this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only 13 didn't really quite get it i saw it again when i was 20 on video of course i now own it was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music <UNK> scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed
<START> those of you who like me were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of <UNK> the <UNK> monster made of wood here is a brief <UNK> br br twenty years after mike <UNK> gordon <UNK> in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of <UNK> his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his <UNK> home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the <UNK> <UNK> according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear what mike doesn't know is that <UNK> is possessed with his father's spirit and begins killing off the friends or is it really mike himself doing the killings who cares br br a have a few troubles with this film the first lies with <UNK> i thought the original made <UNK> look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious <UNK> is a man actor jon <UNK> in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where <UNK> is still supposed to be <UNK> but if you watch closely you can see him <UNK> another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough some of them do namely <UNK> <UNK> of friday the 13th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving <UNK> murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either <UNK> unseen or <UNK> glimpses of the next scene as <UNK> has a <UNK> one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasn't too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesn't help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy <UNK> <UNK> out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night <UNK> score 4 out of 10
<START> to me a matter of life and death is just that simply the best film ever made br br from beginning to end it <UNK> class it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples br br the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing <UNK> and <UNK> to accent the different worlds works <UNK> the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail <UNK> a thoroughly believable fantasy br br no matter how many times i watch the film and i have watched it a lot it never fails to touch me it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry it is as fresh today as it was in 1946 br br if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film
<START> i have never seen a show as good as full house full house puts all of the newer shows to shame big time anyone who has never seen it which i don't see how it is possible should see it it is a great show for anyone of any age full house will make you laugh it will make you cry it will <UNK> you true some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out <UNK> all of the cheesy aspects full house ran it's first episode on september 22 1987 entitled our very first show and ran it's last episode on may 23 1995 entitled michelle rides again part ii br br the plot of the show is very believable danny <UNK> bob <UNK> <UNK> his wife pam in an accident involving a drunk driver danny has his brother in law jesse <UNK> john <UNK> which is <UNK> younger brother and danny also brings in his best friend joey <UNK> dave <UNK> to help him raise his three daughters <UNK> daughters are named dj <UNK> cameron <UNK> stephanie jodie <UNK> and michelle mary kate and ashley olsen joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran for br br the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor actress who played him her john <UNK> jesse john <UNK> is a great actor he plays jesse jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break in full house john <UNK> does a great job portraying his character he looked and played music like his idol elvis <UNK> br br bob <UNK> danny bob <UNK> is also a great actor he <UNK> his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver he has to raise three girls without a having the girl's mother bob <UNK> does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls br br dave <UNK> joey one word can describe dave <UNK> funny he is great playing the character of joey was perfect for him he does a great job playing the stand up comedian waiting for his big break br br <UNK> cameron <UNK> dj she is a tremendous actress she plays the oldest sister dj which is short for donna jo she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen her acting ability in full house was very believable br br jodie <UNK> stephanie two simple words can describe jodie <UNK> incredibly amazing i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about jodie but i would use up the 1 000 word maximum just on her she got her start in a kids show called mother <UNK> stories and when she came to full house she blew the audience's and <UNK> mind her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was according to dave <UNK> jodie was supposed to be the star of the show it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly she showed great enthusiasm most young kids can't do this as you can probably guess jodie <UNK> stephanie is my favorite character in full house br br mary kate and ashley olsen michelle great actress full house is where they got their start they received the part of michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera br br there are many more cast members that should be recognized these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987 br br the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end i think it was to focused on her towards the end especially when i think jodie and <UNK> were much better at acting br br full house is a great show for everyone it can teach you a lot one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as <UNK> a family member occurs full house continues to attract new fans with all this said there is only a couple things left to say full house will never die and thank you the cast of full house for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy
<START> this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage the main characters are the whiny non hero kevin amy his <UNK> <UNK> conservative girlfriend kyle a <UNK> in red shorts who enjoys phone sex daphne a <UNK> horny girl who is supposed to be cool and has no sense of how to dress and her <UNK> boyfriend nick an army <UNK> who can make an innuendo out of anything no i'm not a <UNK> that's really how the movie goes the movie itself is an over <UNK> rip off of <UNK> <UNK> only you'll never find a trace of <UNK> anywhere no these hobgoblins unleashed by <UNK> man i'm sorry kevin make someone's <UNK> dreams come true and then kill the victims yes you guessed it eventually they wind up in a strip club where the nerdy <UNK> greatest dream is revealed she wants to be a stripper look i watched this flick via mst3k and even with mike nelson tom <UNK> and crow t robot making a laughing stock out of this cinematic <UNK> and it still made me bleed from both eyes not really but i wish i had i'm not giving you anymore plot because <UNK> it gives me this great urge to drive a <UNK> through my brain besides it's not like there's a plot worth mentioning they should put a <UNK> general warning on this film
<START> we could still use black <UNK> even today imagine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful hugh laurie hugh is sensational as the <UNK> prince george and edmund as his brilliant assistant i love the episode which kenneth connor guest stars as a british <UNK> every time edmund says <UNK> the two <UNK> do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits it's the funniest things that you will see of course none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without ben <UNK> and richard curtis who are also behind the films like love actually the thin blue line four <UNK> and a funeral black <UNK> is funny and almost too good for television humor can be smart sexy and funny all at one i was hoping last night on saturday night live that hugh laurie would pay homage to his background in british humor if the gang at snl did some research they would know what a treasure it was to have hugh laurie grace their stage
<START> i've said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damn br br the director seems to have a great eye for 30s art <UNK> which i love and i think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making however it's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly <UNK> plotted film spoiler for crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing ok they have one but he's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place <UNK> misses the point of having a villain as far as action goes well let's see sky captain law shoots down one robot two or three of the <UNK> wing <UNK> before <UNK> <UNK> tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him paltrow as polly or peggy or <UNK> or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and <UNK> lack of chemistry is so right and i for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she only has two shots left both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one <UNK> one quite funny although i saw it coming from 70 years away no one except law and paltrow have any significant time on screen and that's the movie's real flaw an audience doesn't identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate without that plus a good engaging story all the cg in the world won't help
<START> this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i've ever seen i laughed so hard i'm sure i missed half the jokes this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is what i particularly like is that he seems never to be <UNK> down the material for his audience his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags thumbs way up
<START> bo derek might have had a career had she not let her late husband john take over as her director it's a real shame no really with the right direction and the right part see 10 bo was okay she wouldn't win any awards even at her best but she is no worse than many an actress who has made it big in the past 15 years or so based on looks alone but <UNK> lay the problem john was determined to ride the wave that bo created with her appearance in 10 that of bo being the perfect 10 the <UNK> woman in america the sex symbol of the 1980s problem is in john's hands this wave crashed with a <UNK> <UNK> in only a few year's time maybe he knew her limitations as an actress perhaps that is why he fashioned movies for her that concentrated on her body not her acting skills but it got old real quick it didn't help matters any that the films of john and bo derek are let's be honest really really bad and bad sums up their take on edgar rice <UNK> literary icon the lord of the jungle tarzan of the apes br br you know what's worst this film is boring make me laugh make me cry just don't bore me not even <UNK> stunning looks and figure can <UNK> any interest and that is what the film is of course built around richard harris god bless his soul he and bo were previously in <UNK> btw <UNK> it up and makes his scenes at least a little interesting and miles <UNK> makes a physically impressive tarzan maybe he got the last laugh after being hit with a ton of <UNK> from the critics over this film miles went on to a solid career as a b movie icon in films that were not great art but a million times more fun than this one but other than that it's <UNK> body and you can only see it so many times before you long for something else to go with it tarzan the ape man has nothing else john derek was a truly dynamic actor he was not a director he should have stayed with his strength this film unfolds at a mind numbingly slow pace and nothing really happens in the action scenes <UNK> tarzan was all about excitement and wish <UNK> who wouldn't want to be as <UNK> strong and good looking as lord <UNK> and fun you get none of that here watch it and you will have wasted <UNK> minutes of your life on second thought you may come away with a valuable lesson how not to handle someone's movie career br br bo derek is all right in my book though she stood by john until his dying day has a true love of animals and nature and even looks back with a giggle at her time in the spotlight she has also <UNK> that she is not the dumb blonde many want her to make her out to be if she could survive tarzan and <UNK> she can survive anything so come back bo all is forgiven br br and as an aside is the steve strong who plays the bad guy the same steve strong who a brief pro wrestling career
<START> this is absolutely the worst trash i have ever seen when i saw it in the theater <UNK> it took 15 full minutes before i realized that what i was seeing was the feature not a sick joke
<START> this was the first regular filmed columbo movie episode but yet it aired as the second after steven spielberg's columbo murder by the book it's also at the same time among one of the better ones br br bernard l <UNK> was one great creative director no wonder that they later asked him to direct three more columbo movies the movie has some real creative and innovative shot sequences and the movie as a whole is also clearly made with style passion and eye for detail every shot <UNK> and is a reason why this movie is better and also better looking just any other average made for tv movie it's definitely one of the better directed columbo movies br br it's a quit original columbo entry for a couple of reasons the murder is more or less an accident and was an <UNK> act so the killer this time doesn't have any time to plan out the <UNK> <UNK> in advance and his to clean up any of the <UNK> afterward and has to <UNK> the body the killer in this movie is not only being handled as the man who committed the crime but more as the man who helps out lieutenant columbo to solve the murder it makes the character a more interesting and layered one as well and also helps to make the way columbo <UNK> the whole crime seem way more interesting as well because of that of course columbo starts to suspect him pretty early on and as always he comes to solution by making himself vulnerable and look more stupid than he of course truly is and by gaining the killer's trust this is obviously no spoiler since this is the way every columbo movie gets set up i liked the story of the movie and how it progressed br br it also helps the movie that it has such a fine cast at the time of this movie peter falk had really made the columbo character his own and the character at this was already fully developed robert <UNK> is truly great as the short <UNK> <UNK> funny thing is that he would later star in three different columbo movies again and one mrs columbo episode only in totally different roles he even played the murderer in a couple of those movies as well again he by the way was not the only actor that did this in other later columbo movies also the great ray <UNK> makes an appearance in this movie as the husband of the victim br br all in all a real great early columbo movie and among the better ones out of the long running series of movies br br 9 10
<START> don't even bother with this movie it's bad when judged on it's own merits but when compared to the 1972 original which is a classic it's down right awful and btw somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book this is silly movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from they are 2 completely different art forms as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does if you used this <UNK> for all movies then 2001 would suck and so would forest <UNK> and silence of the <UNK>
<START> action comedy suspense this movie has it all br br the plot goes that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a heist in a small town in montana every type of crime movie <UNK> character is here frank the master mind carlos the weapons expert max the <UNK> expert nick the safe cracker and ray the car man unfortunately for frank he is <UNK> by 2 bumbling detectives portrayed very well by ed <UNK> and daniel <UNK> that have been chasing him from new jersey write after he sends out the letters to the other 4 br br our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust one another added to the mix is the fact that frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together br br now frank is being taken back to new jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own br br truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
<START> serum starts as eddie derek phillips is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an <UNK> like his father richard dennis o'neill his uncle eddie david h <UNK> however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident is run over by a car taken to the nearest hospital it doesn't look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed a serum which will give the <UNK> the power to self <UNK> any sort of wound or illness desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the <UNK> has <UNK> side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing br br executive produced written directed by steve <UNK> i'll be perfectly frank myself say serum is awful serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to rip off other any number of other's ends up being slightly more fun than having you <UNK> pulled out with <UNK> the script is terrible it has the whole re animator 1985 feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge <UNK> trying to <UNK> death but it's so boring it's untrue the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away finding his ex girlfriend has hooked up with someone else arguments with his step mom getting drunk with his mate generally boring the audience stiff so once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie re animated then he kills a couple of people police catch up with him shoot him the end thank god serum is devoid of any of the <UNK> that one would associate with a good film the character's suck the dialogue is poor it takes itself far too seriously it's dull it's slow it's forgettable considering it's meant to be a horror film there's an <UNK> lack of blood gore or horror not recommended did i mention serum was boring i thought so br br director <UNK> does nothing to <UNK> this thing up although competent there's no style here at all the gore levels are none existent there's a bit of <UNK> blood a bitten neck a couple of <UNK> on a dead woman's face a couple of scenes where a <UNK> <UNK> skin that's it don't expect a re animator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed much like i was in fact filmed in what looks like one house one restaurant a lab the film has no variety either just looks cheap throughout there's a couple of scenes of nudity but that's nowhere near enough to save it br br technically the film isn't too bad at least it looks like proper cameras were used i can't really comment on the special effects because there aren't any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional apparently shot in texas or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actor's rather than friends or family of the director br br serum is a terrible film it's dull slow boring has no gore feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes i don't understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch re animator or one of it's sequels again instead seriously i recommend you give serum a miss there i've just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life you can thank me later
<START> woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better but it would be hard he has had of course some films that aren't quite good but not that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and <UNK> but he has never before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda not quite so tired and so unfunny his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen is it still our good old woody the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected we never hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy than we begin to see the two points of view both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex husband in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for no apparent reason the comedy is about <UNK> who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping <UNK> both go on a wild <UNK> wind of events that never really make sense or fit together or make you laugh more than once or twice there are some nice performances by <UNK> mitchell and will ferrell but they can't fit it together on there own they <UNK> stop it from sinking <UNK> down than most of the other films this year
<START> wow alot of reviews for the <UNK> experiment are here wonderful my name is steve and i run <UNK> films we just started releasing the guinea pig films on dvd for north america now before you ask why am i writing a review instead ask why some people bash it i'm writing this review because i love the guinea pig films why do i love em it's because they go for the throat and they don't let go i've seen it all almost every horror film known to man <UNK> fulci <UNK> <UNK> from every underground cult sensation to every hollywood blockbuster i've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the guinea pig films why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place this review is for the <UNK> experiment i find it devoid of story which is fine by me why do i watch horror films so i can see blood and gore and the torture of people the <UNK> experiment not only delivers but that's all it is pure <UNK> violence yeah i like a story but sometimes i just want the gore and the <UNK> experiment delivers ten <UNK> why do people bash it cause they like a story so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story it make em feel better about themselves we all want blood and gore it's just really hard to justify it if it's not wrapped around a story the guinea pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive <UNK> whenever they have been released br br i'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world maybe i shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe i should my view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it's not i've always told people to find them and to watch them way before i started <UNK> films sure it's <UNK> and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place the <UNK> experiment is not for everybody it's for thrill <UNK> and <UNK> only if you think jason movies and freddy krueger movies are awesome then stick to those but if your on the next level and have seen it all then the <UNK> experiment is for you there is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years they are wrong disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom unless she is totally cool good luck enjoy and never stop living your life
<START> maybe this isn't fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to <UNK> br br the acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a <UNK> i'm no expert but i think people generally put it in a bag br br they use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown it's that over the top <UNK> sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects br br worst movie ever
<START> no wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie it's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic <UNK> cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a <UNK> attraction students fist fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a <UNK> civil war statue the <UNK> <UNK> with a cast of ugh 10 <UNK> <UNK> tries not to gag while he makes out with a mary <UNK> look alike with the most annoying smile since <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reads bob dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging <UNK> and very bad face lift drunken virgin rick <UNK> sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service silly <UNK> school girls dress up in <UNK> stretch pants and walk on the set of <UNK> sing horribly off key and actually make it big in the music business and who wrote this compelling dialog i'm going to <UNK> and wear flowers in my hair i think i found someone to buy <UNK> woody these people are <UNK> these people are my <UNK> as the <UNK> sing mama said oh brother what a mess this is like a <UNK> <UNK> of the 60's except it's not even funny
<START> like all the <UNK> brothers films this one looks great but it is rotten to the core with false <UNK> and <UNK> heap upon each other in some <UNK> of a story in <UNK> this is really just a <UNK> cheap tear <UNK> posing as an intellectually distinguished art film
<START> where to begin there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start okay the two stooges who wrote this <UNK> joseph green and rex <UNK> first they couldn't make up their so called minds for a name my guess they split the difference that's why the main title is brain that wouldn't die but the end screen says head that wouldn't die neither one knows anything about the medical profession after all doctors take <UNK> to do no harm killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered harm plus a little thing called blood and <UNK> matching <UNK> would spell death for jan in the pan plus who keeps a <UNK> work monster what medical school did bill graduate from <UNK> university old fu or mad scientist tech the monster had no name that bugs the hell out of me plus the brilliant surgeon doctor bill <UNK> doesn't know how to keep a patient <UNK> all and all a disaster of a movie it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable except on mst3k i give it the <UNK> turkey
<START> this movie was well done in all respects the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving it is my all time favorite movie ahead of <UNK> white hunter black heart this movie is simply the best br br cheers <UNK>
<START> that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the <UNK> yearning for freedom in some <UNK> british school oh yes it's like in the army you learn to <UNK> and do what you're asked to yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and <UNK> away their optimism on the <UNK> of life great br br basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in if nice intentions that <UNK> no cinematographic challenges the result is a <UNK> movie do you see how boring i mean br br at least that <UNK> helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self indulgent <UNK>
<START> this story is about the romantic triangle between a <UNK> african male prostitute a french <UNK> prostitute stephanie and a russian <UNK> who speaks no french and never seems to <UNK> br br as a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on <UNK> <UNK> winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is <UNK> in a weird blue <UNK> and yes i know it's because the white balance was out everyone is pale and <UNK> and looks <UNK> <UNK> and dirty bodies are <UNK> and shot in such <UNK> that they look quite ugly and unappealing <UNK> <UNK> hair <UNK> bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex br br and the story well <UNK> mother is dying all three characters go back to <UNK> home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably <UNK> interiors we see a bit of <UNK> childhood as a boy called pierre the mother dies well and that's about it really character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story br br i suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non <UNK> but really after paying my seven <UNK> i don't feel like having to <UNK> the film myself that's what the director takes my money for to expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too much br br this film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to <UNK> les <UNK> ie shock the <UNK> i can see how it was a <UNK> in for the berlin film festival and i can see why it got nowhere
<START> spoilers <UNK> br br what really scares you killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath br br maybe but those fears don't even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider and that is the death of one's own child pet sematary <UNK> this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore br br i've read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc i disagree the acting is actually first rate for a film like this maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario but the film's events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible this is the true horror of pet sematary it isn't that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and <UNK> it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that louis <UNK> does despite warning or even past history br br the movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart the heart of a <UNK> trying to make up for not being able to protect and the results are horrifying in fact when the film <UNK> into slasher territory near the end it's almost a letdown although i believe it's perfectly logical how it got there br br i am a true horror fan and i <UNK> that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made if you don't think so see it again after you have children
<START> things to come is an historic film along with metropolis <UNK> it stands as one of the first great science fiction <UNK> it is also one of the first <UNK> movies it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year and even in a subtle way the year it would end in the real world but then the film <UNK> from reality depicting a world <UNK> by war only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 br br the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight making groundbreaking use of models and <UNK> paintings later to become <UNK> of the science fiction genre it is sad that after things to come sci fi would become identified with cheaply made b movies a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001 a space odyssey more than 30 years later if they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film things would have been very different in hollywood br br raymond massey and some of his co stars play multiple roles in this film to good effect massey plays a great doctor who like role as a pilot from an advanced for 1970 civilization who tries to win over the <UNK> of a <UNK> country ruled by a simple minded <UNK> a very effective performance by ralph richardson ultimately the storyline covers 100 years but that's a big problem with this film there really isn't a cohesive storyline br br perhaps in such an episodic film somewhat reminiscent of <UNK> actually it's hard to have a conventional plot but i felt more could have been made of the material and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci fi <UNK> a sequel br br things to come is a film every serious sci fi buff should see at least once unlike metropolis however it might not bear repeated viewings
<START> well i bought the zombie bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun that's what it is without the fun this film truly is mindless it is absent of any plot or character development or any sort of storyline the basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore basically every kill looks exactly the same zombies ripping someone apart yeah that's okay but you need some original kills too i mean it got really lame every kill looked exactly the same filmed exactly the same way thats what killed me i love gore and the gore in this film did nothing for me it was just boring no storyline just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person i wanted to like this movie too i love shot on video gore movies like redneck zombies but i couldn't kid myself this film has it's good points but none of those are in the film i understand that many of the zombies helped out with the <UNK> and there were like over 100 zombies which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world but overall this is a terrible film
<START> i am compelled to write a review of this <UNK> feature as a means of warning others to save your money almost any episode of <UNK> <UNK> the human animal or david <UNK> the nature of things could have <UNK> the material presented not only does the director fail to make use of <UNK> incredible <UNK> to 70 <UNK> film stock and gigantic presentation screen everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the <UNK> of such programming mentioned previously viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather her husband buster and their niece and nephew we follow them for an interminable forty odd minutes as they eat sweat listen to music etc although we are given access to scenes inside the human <UNK> track and learn about <UNK> natural diving <UNK> do we really learn anything more than most grade school <UNK> are we even remotely entertained by the <UNK> atlantic heather do we care avoid this film at all cost if you do wish to see an <UNK> feature i suggest the beautifully photographed india kingdom of the tiger or the technically thrilling space station 3d trust me
<START> the best of the seven sam fuller movies that i've seen including park row run of the arrow <UNK> shock <UNK> the naked kiss the big red one and this film pickup on south street counts as one of the best film <UNK> it represents fuller at his most controlled i like him when he's out of control of course but nearly everything in pickup is perfect the film is absolutely beautiful richard widmark stars as a <UNK> who steals some <UNK> that was meant to go to communist spies jean peters plays the woman who was carrying the film for her boyfriend played by richard <UNK> peters is forced to find widmark and get it back she finds him through a <UNK> <UNK> played by thelma ritter widmark and peters are attracted to each other which changes peters <UNK> that and the fact that she learns she's working for <UNK> the cold war stuff is really interesting the love story is done a little quickly and not entirely believable but it's not so bad that it <UNK> the film unlike <UNK> previous film park row richard widmark is great this must be one of his best roles but i'm not so familiar with his career that i can say that for sure thelma ritter gives the most memorable performance her role gives the film an unexpected emotional <UNK> and her final scene in this film is as touching as any you will find in the cinema i will never forget that 10 10
<START> still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time it has been <UNK> compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of it's outing of many rock clich√©s unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy that's all that matters oh yeah the <UNK> pretty damn good too written by mick jones of <UNK> and chris <UNK> of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea the crying game but would only later become familiar with bill <UNK> underworld love actually pirates of the <UNK> ii and timothy <UNK> the harry potter movies
<START> this movie portrays ruth as a <UNK> hard drinking gambling <UNK> sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe <UNK> early life was quite interesting and this was for all <UNK> and purposes was <UNK> in this film also lou <UNK> was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball <UNK> <UNK> their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for <UNK> on his faults and not his greatness
<START> my favorite part was when the credits started to roll i wish i could give it a <UNK> out of 10 i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back don't waste your money or time on it i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after <UNK> br br <UNK> was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career but she chose to be in it br br all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked more than <UNK> and <UNK> combined that's saying something br br don't br br do br br it
<START> chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so annoying unless you believe in <UNK> re incarnation and the other <UNK> <UNK> which this <UNK> big time the re <UNK> of souls they call it here <UNK> <UNK> br br this story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait it's also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr <UNK> shepherd ryan <UNK> and mary stuart masterson br br at least it's a pretty tame film language wise that's about the only redeeming quality of this movie
<START> the most <UNK> way to describe ride with the devil is with but one word authenticity i will not rehash what has already been said about this <UNK> film but i would like to say how much the historical research and <UNK> attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this <UNK> br br as a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film i must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding bleeding kansas yes there were liberties taken on the actual events as all fiction is apt to do but the overall feel of the film is genuine authentic costumes authentic attitudes no pc <UNK> here even the actors look authentic even jewel <UNK> who has a small part in the film looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph br br a few viewers i talked with have expressed their <UNK> at the stylized dialog they cannot believe that 19th century <UNK> would talk like <UNK> br br what they don't realize is that in this age of verbal <UNK> the american public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly <UNK> and <UNK> bunch these people were raised on shakespeare and the king james version of the bible the screenwriters <UNK> the most likely verbal styles of these people judging from <UNK> of the time the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film br br but in addition to a historical document this film works on a visceral level as well beautifully photographed and performed it <UNK> back to the days of the great western epics the raid on lawrence kansas done so many times before in so many other lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action br br romance adventure moral and <UNK> conflict this film has everything a <UNK> <UNK> could want br br in a year that was dominated by <UNK> garbage like american beauty this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system but i am certain that ride with the devil will be given it's due in the coming years please rent this film you will not be disappointed
<START> there are bad movies then there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art this is one of those films my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked you know staring off into space and <UNK> you can tell that the people involved i hope they changed their names to protect themselves were having a blast and they definitely weren't shy i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous <UNK> and really bad gore effects i laughed out loud during most of the movie so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time beware viewer the above words in no way <UNK> that this is a good film because it is not all i can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title
<START> of those comments here before mine i mostly agree with <UNK> the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny but though managing at some points in other places it failed you could see them wanting to make a joke but no one in the audience laughed also agree with <UNK> view on the end credits leave it normal or make it cool but not what they've done now br br ok that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie i enjoyed it it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely didn't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature like luke <UNK> character matt asking the super chick p <UNK> or bed when she told him she'd get him a new one after a wild night in bed ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore br br i cannot however agree with <UNK> who says that the film could earn an <UNK> rating there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that some sexual acts yes but nothing explicit only humorous and no nudity whatsoever maybe he was at a <UNK> that showed more i'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever superman returns and click i didn't really expect anything from either one i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially <UNK> which i wouldn't <UNK> film superman surprised me with actually having me feel good <UNK> about seeing his first heroic deed like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it but for the rest of the story i'd rather watch my super ex girlfriend at least it offers some surprises click again was a total surprise much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie the jokes also work much better than in ex girlfriend both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones br br anyway the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i've seen within a very short period and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all i'd rank them click girlfriend superman
<START> this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen worse than the most <UNK> american <UNK> worse than <UNK> <UNK> carey in american <UNK> par excellence i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of <UNK> <UNK> and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea it's not it is <UNK> rubbish from very <UNK> of satan himself who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it robert jones as <UNK> producer spending our tax <UNK> money <UNK> money folks on this piece of nonsense should be <UNK> who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re make <UNK> i ask you camp as a christmas tree <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is classic of really bad british film we really don't need a reminder and we certainly don't need a poor second rate badly scripted badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the <UNK> men i rest my case br br do not pay any money to see this it is absolute and utter crap the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge <UNK> of cash our cash for making it they should hang their heads in shame br br i am <UNK> at the low low standard of this film it makes me <UNK> that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show harvey <UNK> where are you come back we forgive you
<START> i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday i don't know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the <UNK> while it may have a bright color <UNK> and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie there are some old things missing that <UNK> this gadget right down the toilet br br first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough the gadget mobile is now a talking car not a car that can turn into a van plus it looks a lot <UNK> and <UNK> instead of being plain cool penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all br br the plot is non existent there's something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all i got what the deal was with the short giant italian guy i will never know it had nothing to do with anything br br and if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever and he stays on the force so why it's called <UNK> <UNK> is a mystery also br br i wasn't impressed at all this is an <UNK> to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd but don't let that <UNK> you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it
<START> movie had some good acting and good moments though obviously pretty low budget but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed the main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all there are a few scenes where they disagree because of it but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently especially since the <UNK> of glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money also several times glenn is portrayed <UNK> for being the way he is <UNK> to adam for his past while adam is shown to be <UNK> and traditional which the film <UNK> to be the good way in the end i don't like being <UNK> to like that i attended a discussion session with the director after viewing <UNK> and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in <UNK> shoes and he said he does in real life relate to <UNK> view that he could never date someone with <UNK> views well then i think he should have done a much better job explaining how glenn could do it in the film also director said he directed this his first movie only after reading directing for <UNK> directing was not that bad but far from a top notch effort i've seen worse but i rarely leave films feeling this frustrated
<START> loony tunes have <UNK> at least twice into the future the first time was with the brilliantly funny duck <UNK> the latter time was with this ¬Ö um ¬Ö effort <UNK> unleashed isn't without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn't up to warner brothers quality wb cartoons are noted for their <UNK> humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children these pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up br br the premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals 2 <UNK> a <UNK> devil a duck a <UNK> and a <UNK> live on the city planet of <UNK> and <UNK> super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in <UNK> what's confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count up to <UNK> from the 21st century cute but <UNK> stupid br br in each episode the super <UNK> ¬ñ amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter ¬ñ fight various super villains for the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh ¬ñ the usual evil laugh of course why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always ¬ñ always ¬ñ laugh <UNK> at every opportunity animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the <UNK> of villains and occasionally their <UNK> and or <UNK> br br in point of fact the makers of this series missed their best <UNK> right from the get go the <UNK> of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not the problem here is that we don't see enough wb <UNK> <UNK> and ace have fairly ordinary <UNK> generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as bugs like what we have here is basically the silly and <UNK> teen <UNK> including its overly modern animation look but with animals <UNK> br br the other <UNK> by the <UNK> creators is or are the villains as noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil laugh bit <UNK> amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists adding to the fun could have been say <UNK> sam ¬ñ as well as the <UNK> still hunting <UNK> ¬ñ as well as tech e <UNK> converted into a really neurotic villain ¬ñ and so on ah the sadness of missed <UNK> br br sadly this whole production has gone into too much <UNK> that is a 2nd season nevertheless we can <UNK> that there's something new out there for the 14 going on 9 crowd the rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of duck <UNK>
<START> after seeing arthur on tv numerous times i laughed so hard dudley moore's role as arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but john gielgud as his servant father figure <UNK> was equally charming i bought the dvd a few weeks ago and watched it despite the passage of nearly 27 years it's still as enjoyable as it ever was <UNK> <UNK> role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic br br arthur bach moore is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child his activities are <UNK> by his dry english butler <UNK> gielgud it appears that nobody really cares about arthur except for him <UNK> father <UNK> offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde <UNK> susan johnson <UNK> in four weeks he'll cut off his son's inheritance of <UNK> million dollars br br however arthur meets and falls in love with linda <UNK> minnelli a young working class waitress and tie thief now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money when <UNK> dies arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with susan before the wedding leaving him to keep both the money and his true love br br arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone
<START> i thought it would at least be <UNK> beautiful it was slow pretentious and boring i almost fell asleep there are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out <UNK> while someone <UNK> randomly on a wooden object that being said there are some pretty songs but it's not worth seeing <UNK> movie over go on <UNK> they have the album preview it and choose the good ones br br half the movie is some guy making tea well that's a slight exaggeration but you'll see what i mean if you see it that being said don't see it
<START> it's hard to rate films like this because do you rate it on production or just fun br br i saw this film back in about 1988 <UNK> or so when i was a boy and i'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible but there is a certain <UNK> surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere what is important are the fight scenes while a <UNK> <UNK> are really good br br i must say it was better when i was a boy only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film but as a sit back with a few beers martial arts film i can't fault it it delivers and is much better than the mountains of american ninja style rubbish that was <UNK> out in the 80's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes br br in an interesting note dusty nelson the writer and director of <UNK> killers did another ninja film under the <UNK> movie flag called white phantom i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to <UNK> killers but the <UNK> clan is once again a main feature including the same <UNK> and similar story only this time including a white ninja this too while being mostly dire had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more <UNK> and to be frank are pretty awful br br so if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours
<START> i attended camp <UNK> it was located at the head of the <UNK> bay on the north east river in <UNK> it was a similar type summer camp with <UNK> it was established by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i started out as a young <UNK> and later became a junior senior <UNK> and later the <UNK> director if the camp had continued i would have done anything within my power to become the camp director alas the powers of the <UNK> decided to close down the camp and sell it to the state of <UNK> i visited the former camp some years later by boat and was <UNK> by the neglect of the state of <UNK> and natural destruction by mother nature the <UNK> <UNK> site served so many with all the benefits of contact with <UNK> offerings a black man by the name of curtis ford and his family were residents and <UNK> of the property mr curtis was my friend and mentor i <UNK> his every being even as he could not swim he was a <UNK> if i asked him where the fish were biting he would <UNK> the spot and i would have a ball <UNK> was also a family camp at the end of the summer these memories will be with me for eternity
<START> faith and <UNK> viewed through the lens of an elderly <UNK> jewish american gentleman and a younger african american jewish gentleman who <UNK> between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have <UNK> over the years br br <UNK> character is a <UNK> with <UNK> back problems and a <UNK> ill wife <UNK> character is a career hustler never <UNK> on a regular job and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd <UNK> he must convince mostel to <UNK> his faith as it has been failing along with his wife's health and his own but <UNK> <UNK> has his own problems still <UNK> for the girlfriend he left behind br br <UNK> character leaves the film before he seemingly should and so the the ending is <UNK> and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending br br this is not a <UNK> hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith it is worth watching more than once and <UNK> the excellent performances of the principal actors
<START> i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what's up tiger lily with this film br br it has to be one of the worst french films i've seen in a long time actually along with <UNK> of the wolves 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time br br it's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun <UNK> <UNK> in particular and jean <UNK> being among my <UNK> i was <UNK> disappointed to see them <UNK> in such a poor film br br lou <UNK> is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent br br avoid this film if you want to laugh watch an <UNK> <UNK> instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la <UNK> de <UNK>
<START> the movie was very sweet and heartwarming i cry almost every time i watch the movie i would recommend this movie for every one the movie was so inspiring to me the actors did a great job of acting and the movie was very well played and done the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her br br after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie the little girl who raised paulie love <UNK> all the obstacles
<START> i saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's i have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on video finally it's out it was made in brazil so i assumed that was why it hadn't made it to video yet i have been checking video stores for the past 15 years waiting for this outstanding movie to come out it is one of my all time favorites but be warned it is weird like <UNK> <UNK> weird its weirdness <UNK> from its super realism br br the movie is based on a true incident back a few centuries ago in pre colonial times when europeans were first <UNK> the <UNK> in the amazon a white man is mistaken by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy so they intend to kill him before they <UNK> him though they make him part of their tribe their <UNK> the entire movie is like watching a national <UNK> documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe that's it <UNK> <UNK> no intense insight into the variety of human life definitely br br oh yeah be warned this film has definite nudity this is not some hollywood schlock flick about noble <UNK> this film tells it like it was re read above national <UNK> super realism br br
<START> i bought this video at <UNK> 1 bin i think i over paid in the 1940s bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd rate movies for small studios in this case <UNK> the ones who made most of the <UNK> boys films while the <UNK> of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ed wood classics such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die hard fans br br i am an old movie <UNK> so i gave this a try besides a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good just not this one br br lugosi is what else a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he <UNK> from young brides they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had so you can see that the plot was never really <UNK> out at all br br anyways a really annoying female reporter a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen so she follows some clues all the way to the <UNK> of lugosi <UNK> home is complete with his crazed wife a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the <UNK> sons an ugly <UNK> sex fiend and a dwarf naturally this <UNK> reporter <UNK> repeatedly throughout the film apparently <UNK> and good <UNK> <UNK> go hand in hand eventually the <UNK> all die mostly due to their own hands and all is well at the conclusion the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry and naturally the <UNK> dumb cameraman <UNK> when this occurs if you haven't noticed there's a lot of <UNK> in this film or maybe because it was such a slow and <UNK> film they just fell asleep
<START> all the other comments already said what i was going to say here goes anyway i thought this was italian at first sorry about that italy i wasn't bored because i kept waiting for something to happen who did that song about dr <UNK> and professor <UNK> way back when was it alan parsons saw this on a <UNK> 10 pack and the quality was as expected terrible full of <UNK> and stuff the movie was an incoherent mess goofy music and clueless characters the main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was <UNK> than the patients i thought the doctor directing the battle scene was never going to end had some good looking babes though it seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked i gave it a 2 for the <UNK> women that bird people dance made me want to pull out my own <UNK> poe probably did about 3 000 <UNK> in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his
<START> indeed drug use warehouse shoot 'em ups <UNK> <UNK> bullet <UNK> a futuristic city with a mix of asian races and a lonely vampire all in the same movie seems like a story that could only be <UNK> by a japanese pop rock star and that is exactly what <UNK> <UNK> is and more while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b movie of the week <UNK> <UNK> pulls it off with but a few expected <UNK> and <UNK> along the way br br the film has a gritty definitely independent feel to it jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition but rather <UNK> leaps and <UNK> giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely <UNK> at a true plot but the film makes no excuses instead turning the story into one of friendship love trust and betrayal all sugar <UNK> in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society <UNK> gangsters and vampires br br hyde as the somber vampire <UNK> is excellent giving depth to the character and <UNK> out the overly <UNK> acting of gackt as <UNK> ' an orphan who befriends <UNK> lee <UNK> wang also shines as the vengeful <UNK> who becomes friends with a grown up sho the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal br br while the action at times is all too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show off one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features the <UNK> as actors have their flaws and so do their characters the movie rarely gets boring and ends where it should after jumping about quite a bit <UNK> <UNK> is rather enjoyable humorous at times and even very touching it is definitely worth your time
<START> how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible <UNK> ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film what's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this <UNK> fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
<START> stories about the possibility of a post apocalyptic future have been around for ages since the very creation of science fiction as a genre per se the fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow and that our own <UNK> and <UNK> to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories whether they are good or bad br br terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film he gives the movie a <UNK> feel throughout showing a society run <UNK> by its own <UNK> and bringing forth the a sense of <UNK> tragedy despite having moments of comedy his world the world in which twelve monkeys <UNK> is a place where the mad run wild where cities are <UNK> in filth and neglect where everything <UNK> of foreboding despite the <UNK> of the opening sequence where madness <UNK> at every corner this is a very dark movie but his very best most linear despite the plot twists which hold up under examination and one which gets better with repeated viewings br br a tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the <UNK> of life on the planet as we have known it leads to scientists of the future to try and make <UNK> to change <UNK> fate on the earth by <UNK> <UNK> citizens the <UNK> of the earth as guinea pigs to go back in time among them one james cole <UNK> to great effect by bruce willis cole could be any person we don't know anything about him but in a way that doesn't matter since he is little more than one of many <UNK> <UNK> and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission what we do know is that he is a man who dreams and his dreams may have been reality he may have already been at the scene of the event of 1996 br br it's this constant sense of <UNK> <UNK> that keeps popping up throughout the movie when taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets jeffrey <UNK> <UNK> played by brad pitt oscar nominated here who <UNK> <UNK> forth talk about doom and destruction and later cole believes he has seen <UNK> in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping what he doesn't know later he meets a psychologist kathryn <UNK> madeleine <UNK> and one of her first reactions to him is that he's insane and that she's seen him before this becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive <UNK> to active and even slightly crazy believer that something terrible is coming this way especially when she meets him six years later she has seen cole before at the same time cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the <UNK> screaming for help after shots have <UNK> out and a particular red headed man in a <UNK> jeffrey <UNK> has apparently escaped not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent <UNK> the questions <UNK> have these events happened are they going to happen who is really a part of this or better yet is everyone down to the smallest player a part of a greater plot or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which time in itself is one huge <UNK> belt showing <UNK> of <UNK> of events that slide by over and over again br br these questions are <UNK> in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece vertigo in which madeleine <UNK> judy barton <UNK> her own brief existence you took no notice she says as cole and <UNK> watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in snippets of dialog from vertigo form a foil to the dialog between <UNK> and cole and later when cole <UNK> from having apparently <UNK> off in the theatre and goes looking for <UNK> he comes face to face with her in disguise looking almost exactly like eva maria saint from north by <UNK> as the <UNK> bernard <UNK> score plays the <UNK> of judy barton dressed as madeleine <UNK> it's a fascinating sequence more so because of the most improbable <UNK> of the names of the actors in both films madeleine <UNK> plays kathryn <UNK> who <UNK> a blond wig and grey <UNK> coat and calls herself judy simmons while helping an insane man named james cole james stewart plays a detective who tries to help insane madeleine <UNK> who will later re appear not once but twice first as brunette judy barton and later as madeleine action and re <UNK> play and re play
<START> so i got a hold of this as an assignment for <UNK> harris who teaches occasionally in the film <UNK> at the u of u i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film br br the documentary section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a nut job from no where but that's not good enough to keep it interesting br br seeing sean penn dressed as a <UNK> is the only highlight and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor br br when <UNK> glover takes on larry the story telling was better but i just couldn't take anymore
<START> as with all of <UNK> films the suspended step of the <UNK> <UNK> demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are <UNK> with no monologues or <UNK> <UNK> the characters' inner conflicts doubts or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional <UNK> and instead forces them to explore and study the characters' identities for themselves as a result the acting is understated and <UNK> as opposed to overt and explicit br br the action scenes are set between long <UNK> of <UNK> where the viewer is asked to become a <UNK> to participate as an actor by <UNK> his or her own psyche as in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the author's writing to provide a <UNK> where the <UNK> imagination and or past experience <UNK> <UNK> drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the <UNK> pacing the <UNK> dialogues that have become his trademark <UNK> the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective <UNK> uses silence to capture moments of high intensity <UNK> to the non verbal language of gestures <UNK> sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so far br br the music by <UNK> long time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> provides more than just a <UNK> background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light <UNK> presents us with an other <UNK> one far different from the <UNK> of the tourist <UNK> with <UNK> blue <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> drowned in an eternal sunshine here the <UNK> are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> have been replaced by the <UNK> dirty snow of the village streets <UNK> genius through <UNK> camera is on display throughout the film br br the suspended step of the <UNK> is above all else a political statement aimed at the <UNK> political situation in the <UNK> at the end of the <UNK> century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the <UNK> border the <UNK> political or other <UNK> by the rest of humanity wait they may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper <UNK> borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races although <UNK> political views are well known the film <UNK> clear of any political <UNK> regarding the causes of the <UNK> <UNK> in the process <UNK> forces us to <UNK> on the concepts of <UNK> cultural political and personal borders br br <UNK> considers himself a <UNK> of <UNK> century <UNK> and he likes to bring lessons from the <UNK> <UNK> into his discussions in this film he does some border crossing himself between the greek and italian cultures drawing from a combined <UNK> and <UNK> tradition of <UNK> travel alexander is a <UNK> in search of a story about an aging greek politician <UNK> who disappeared never to be heard of again this political man a brilliant <UNK> unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his <UNK> existence his wife and his brilliant career to live <UNK> in a <UNK> camp with the lowest of the low he became a poet in <UNK> wondering how to change the world of course the politician is not <UNK> father but the politician stands before alexander like a father figure <UNK> as with <UNK> <UNK> alexander grows as a person during his odyssey br br of course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of <UNK> odyssey in a contemporary context <UNK> draws on <UNK> travels only as <UNK> and <UNK> elements for his film in <UNK> ending <UNK> is more like the <UNK> <UNK> he does not leave for <UNK> but goes on carrying a <UNK> and alexander <UNK> is suspended between returning to his home and his career or <UNK> on a voyage to somewhere else he states as much in a voice over at the beginning of the film <UNK> few lines from <UNK> <UNK> and don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again the wind blows your eyes far away br br finally although <UNK> is not a religious person there is a greek <UNK> religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow suited <UNK> who go around <UNK> things for their fellow human beings by <UNK> <UNK> and also the christ like figure of the politician in the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the <UNK> <UNK> influence in <UNK> work they appear like <UNK> religious figures found in the <UNK> tradition <UNK> and <UNK> men who took up their <UNK> upon the tops of <UNK> in a form of <UNK> br br the film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by mastroianni <UNK> does not give us any clues and the wife's statement it's not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough the important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the <UNK> politician but that he could be the politician but the film still ends on an optimistic note whereas the <UNK> strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus <UNK> across the border are still not possible and it remains <UNK> we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is <UNK> alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the <UNK> on this account <UNK> gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldn't be laughing you've already reached the <UNK> of voice <UNK> and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their <UNK> wide open mouths and <UNK> eyes you feel a <UNK> <UNK> beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly <UNK> up your throat and well you get the point br br but for all its <UNK> and punches in the face <UNK> really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the <UNK> mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and <UNK> makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel <UNK> sorry for him br br it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald <UNK> film but for some insane reason i felt an <UNK> determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy <UNK> the film has to offer if someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly <UNK> your entire body you endure the pain perhaps out of spite or some unknown <UNK> curiosity i can't even begin to attempt to explain br br unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you but if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a <UNK> bag
<START> the human <UNK> is a campy 70's <UNK> movie starring nightclub comedian <UNK> ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date the movie tells the tale of <UNK> a bad ass <UNK> hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife <UNK> barely escapes and <UNK> to sunny california to visit an old friend a nightclub owner and <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> named queen <UNK> however it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her <UNK> so <UNK> takes matters into his own hands <UNK> ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film including strong dramatic skills a <UNK> of kung fu an impressive singing voice he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack a touching compassionate side with the ladies and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing this film has it all people a deep plot <UNK> action laugh a minute comedy beautiful women in distress a slam bang ending what more could you ask from a movie run don't walk to your local video store and rent the human <UNK> today and be sure to share it with your family
<START> and the oscar for the most under rated classic horror actor goes to dwight frye seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as karloff lugosi and price and this movie proves it his character herman was one of the 2 reasons i can give to watch this movie dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed <UNK> a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie br br the other reason is the comic relief of m <UNK> being in the medical profession myself i have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self pity prone <UNK> though other medical mistakes did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor <UNK> his fellow <UNK> <UNK> well continue giving it to her unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this <UNK> slow movie the plot is predictable with only few minor twists the filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more <UNK> at making me yawn yes you can use too much shadow br br my recommendation watch this once to see frye and <UNK> but only when wide awake and with lots of <UNK>
<START> stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment <UNK> graham michael <UNK> zane busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted lame jokes abound and every punch line is well <UNK> the dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a <UNK> <UNK> the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and <UNK> for the entire movie another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school avoid this and seek out one of <UNK> truly funny films like national <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

<START> others have already commented on the decline of director tobe hooper but what about brad <UNK> he was perfectly capable of <UNK> good projects as he proved by starring in the same year's exorcist iii so why did he agree to appear in this sure he gives a suitably demented performance and the film is not outright bad it's just <UNK> uninteresting and unappealing that's three un s too many 1 2
<START> this is perhaps the best <UNK> ever a british better this is spinal tap the characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely <UNK> with some of the events such as <UNK> problem with fitting in the band br br the soundtrack is excellent real period stuff even if it is in the same key you'll be <UNK> some of the songs for days what i liked was the nearly all british cast with some of the favourite household names <UNK> wife is priceless br br the film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it a <UNK> of some really good <UNK> br br it's a hidden diamond
<START> the israeli palestinian conflict <UNK> and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries few have a clue to the other aspect of the division the group of people who want peace and work toward <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> fox in the bubble <UNK> <UNK> has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the <UNK> <UNK> to tell a story that contains some fine humor a lot of love and a taste of brutal reality it is a window into a situation that begs for understanding br br in tel <UNK> three close friends are roommates <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful young woman with strong opinions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a very <UNK> gay young man who works in a popular <UNK> and noam <UNK> <UNK> a handsome somewhat shy fellow who in addition to his day job in a music shop is a member of the national guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city's <UNK> it is during one of these guard duty <UNK> that he meets a young palestinian named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a mutual attraction occurs the three friends decide to <UNK> the <UNK> present <UNK> whom they <UNK> with an israeli name and while <UNK> and noam settle into a love relationship <UNK> hires <UNK> at his <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> both proceed to find love interests too all goes well until <UNK> must return home for his sister's wedding though in tel <UNK> <UNK> has been able to be openly gay with noam life is far different in <UNK> <UNK> is told he must marry his sister's <UNK> to be sister in an attempt to rescue <UNK> from his fate noam and <UNK> disguise themselves as french <UNK> to gain access to <UNK> in a moment of supposed <UNK> noam and <UNK> are discovered kissing by the <UNK> to be and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for <UNK> to remain <UNK> the <UNK> br br while the young people in tel <UNK> are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful <UNK> an attack occurs in <UNK> one that has grave consequences not only immediately but also in the revenge mission <UNK> must now assume the ending is tragic on many levels and it <UNK> just how serious the problem between these two countries is br br the acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people the story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes <UNK> fox such a fine writer director more people should watch this important and very fine film in <UNK> <UNK> and english with subtitles grady <UNK>
<START> this is probably one of the worst wanna be a low budget hit films to credit the dinosaur genre the film is so predictable you could go away cook yourself dinner go answer the phone or whatever and when you're back you'll know exactly what has happened the special effects are so poor you would have thought <UNK> <UNK> were used and the super fast dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator the acting is over <UNK> they try so hard yet there just isn't enough character behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist yeah okay we know exactly whats going to happen to the blonde chick in glasses stereotypical was created for films like this if you want to watch this film i suggest you aren't in as a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were and if you are really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them don't watch it you might break the screen the facts are that far off
<START> i was pretty young when this came out in the us but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing <UNK> to this day i still catch myself <UNK> it the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from frank sinatra to <UNK> stallone to mr t the voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying the puppets were also well done although a little creepy i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug <UNK> of red dwarf a show that i also enjoy very much like another person had written in a comment earlier i too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release but i don't think enough people have heard of it oh well maybe i'll try e bay
<START> in 1993 the <UNK> was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the <UNK> century and take christian <UNK> back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that <UNK> feels completely at ease in the world of the <UNK> century and so make him get back in the <UNK> ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without <UNK> in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes <UNK> headed sometimes a bit of a mess br br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and <UNK> fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie <UNK> the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren't better marie anne <UNK> is nonexistent and christian <UNK> unbearable br br of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into <UNK> and <UNK> certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because <UNK> takes back elements that <UNK> the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding br br a <UNK> and disappointing follow up anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial br br
<START> the shining is a weird example of adaptation it has very little in common with the source novel written by stephen king yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic <UNK> of the horror <UNK> work this is due to two factors stanley kubrick's masterful direction and jack <UNK> <UNK> acting br br nicholson plays jack <UNK> a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period <UNK> by the gruesome stories surrounding the place he claims a nice isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the <UNK> family jack his wife wendy shelley duvall and their five year old son danny danny lloyd the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that <UNK> wrong he has been told by the cook dick <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he is <UNK> with a mysterious psychic energy the titular shining which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future among other things because of this gift the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny even though he is quite capable of <UNK> them that is not jack's case however as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts <UNK> a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break br br the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick though having never worked on this kind of film before knew exactly what was effective and what wasn't hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative <UNK> king criticized the director for changing most of the story <UNK> most of the jack danny subplot merely hinted at in the film that led to the <UNK> emotionally strong climax and while his disappointment is valid the <UNK> was actually necessary the novel dealt with redemption albeit in an unconventional way and redemption is a theme kubrick one of the most famous <UNK> of human <UNK> never had a soft spot for what he is interested in is the mental and subsequently physical <UNK> that threatens the characters and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the <UNK> shot <UNK> encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example br br another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writer's opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus <UNK> the rest of the story now it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning but it is equally true that martin sheen king's ideal choice for the role probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as <UNK> from the moment he starts <UNK> in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal here's johnny scene it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 isn't bad the <UNK> character is <UNK> linked to the one flew over the <UNK> nest star as for duvall and lloyd both add terrific support the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> joel <UNK> as <UNK> great horror child icons one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart blonde and beautiful and not having much else to do but scream and run but two things ought to be considered a back in 1980 the scream queen clich√© wasn't one yet b rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera making the book movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from <UNK> eyes br br <UNK> <UNK> the author of <UNK> once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work and he should know given the liberties danny boyle took when his <UNK> masterpiece was brought to the screen yet that doesn't mean the movie is necessarily bad the shining proves said point to perfection very little from the novel approximately 5 is included in the film but in kubrick and <UNK> hands this <UNK> in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest most original horror pictures of all time which really is saying something given the <UNK> current poor form
<START> i'm not ruining anything when i inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie if that is your thing then your movie has arrived br br a woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods her sister is a creepy lady to say the least and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love on the side a group of <UNK> characters show up and begin <UNK> all kinds of <UNK> <UNK> br br the plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb the woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the <UNK> even continues the have sex with him on the exploitative side of things there is much <UNK> flesh and a couple of kinky <UNK> but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else oh and the aforementioned goat sex scene br br most viewers won't make it to the end exploitation fans will ride it out but will be left wanting more br br 4 10
<START> better than the typical made for tv movie <UNK> to hell is blessed with excellent casting <UNK> <UNK> cassidy mccarthy pre murphy brown joe <UNK> <UNK> moon frye and a high concept update to the familiar <UNK> plot <UNK> is likable as always and <UNK> is particularly <UNK> and <UNK> over the top in the mother of all femme fatale roles kind of a hybrid version of <UNK> wives and they live the movie commits early to its apocalyptic <UNK> vision and horror fans will likely not have many complaints until the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 7 10
<START> although written by stephen king an overrated writer if there ever was one this is actually quite entertaining b movie <UNK> incestuous creatures who live in the candle lit house and drain the life force of <UNK> great graveyard scenery heroic cats and very pretty virgin the soundtrack even has <UNK> music an idea which i found quite nice i'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie although it has crappy dialogue and ideas all of them from a true and tedious king <UNK> albeit <UNK> if i'm understood right is a script without any novel or short story behind it still those touches of <UNK> <UNK> show he didn't use a ghost writer after all
<START> when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film making this picture has a <UNK> voice that will echo throughout the <UNK> of film history br br the opening montage provides a splendid palette which <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uses to establish his art on this <UNK> of entertainment br br <UNK> truly uses the camera as his <UNK> while he brings us along on a ride that <UNK> the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become <UNK> to and <UNK> deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of <UNK> this movie is any director's dream at its very core br br however <UNK> was not alone in this epic <UNK> the writing provided by <UNK> tim sheridan was just as breathtaking br br the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning spoilers spoilers where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the <UNK> and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert <UNK> br br in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat br br therefore much praise must be given to producer scott <UNK> who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and <UNK> makes it look easy br br all in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more br br the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art

<START> hong kong directors crossing over to hollywood to make movies is nothing new with the temporary <UNK> of the likes of tsui <UNK> john woo <UNK> <UNK> in the 90s from their collective <UNK> only a few movies or may i say just one made an impact at the box office the andrew <UNK> and alan <UNK> <UNK> has been a tour de force in recent hk cinematic history especially with their now famous <UNK> affairs trilogy which was remade into martin <UNK> the <UNK> so it's no surprise when hollywood comes knocking on the door br br but without fellow <UNK> <UNK> who usually has script story duties how did <UNK> fare with writers hans bauer and craig mitchell it's like the x files without the x in the way the story is crafted the characters and the parallels drawn with the chris carter series richard gere and claire danes pair up ala david duchovny and gillian anderson only that they don't belong to any federal <UNK> agency who bear arms but are employees of protective services who's chief role is to ensure that sexual <UNK> who belong to their <UNK> are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time hence they are the <UNK> <UNK> to their flock only that their flock suffer from sick sexual <UNK> with the <UNK> for violence br br the parallels in characterization are so blatantly obvious that it's just a <UNK> touch up on the outside like fox <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a strange lonely man consumed by his obsession in his quest to <UNK> <UNK> his flock to <UNK> the line <UNK> by a failed attempt to rescue a missing child just like how <UNK> <UNK> for his missing sister <UNK> is <UNK> by colleagues and given the <UNK> orders disguised as a retirement plan he has deep disgust for the people he's <UNK> sick of their crimes and what they stand for that he has no <UNK> in using <UNK> methods short of flying off the handle while <UNK> out illegal <UNK> punishment at the same time he too has strong <UNK> that he has to fight against in order not to cross the line into becoming like those he <UNK> as part of routine he also <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> for clues and leads toward his objective that of seeking closure salvation for himself and <UNK> a strong belief that the truth is still out there and he wants to believe br br <UNK> allison <UNK> on the other hand is the <UNK> brought in to replace <UNK> but in the meantime while learning the <UNK> on the job for the next 18 days she is required to spy on him and to report his <UNK> pretty much like what dana <UNK> was <UNK> to do with fox <UNK> as the <UNK> of pre <UNK> and holding onto the notion that those <UNK> back to society have been <UNK> of their <UNK> she slowly starts to see what <UNK> sees and understands that it takes a whole lot more than being just a desk and <UNK> job if she truly wants to help people br br and it is this discovery of the world of <UNK> and <UNK> sexual practices that we open all our eyes to much like how <UNK> starring nicolas cage brought snuff films into the spotlight it's a decent <UNK> drama with the usual red herrings and my are they really good ones as it made you wonder quite often if your <UNK> are correct and you soon find yourself firing from the hip as you get proved incorrect at <UNK> <UNK> though i don't credit this to a tight narrative but more from the <UNK> number of characters watch out for <UNK> <UNK> cameo and sub plots the scene in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was akin to <UNK> david mills and william <UNK> when they <UNK> john <UNK> apartment and find plenty of <UNK> inside though here given the subject nature it wasn't <UNK> upon much br br apparently the flock somehow decided that <UNK> <UNK> cinematography was good enough despite its very strange style of having no style <UNK> almost every trick in the book to try and recreate feelings of watching another <UNK> only that this was deeply <UNK> in <UNK> of brown rather than the doom and <UNK> of black it does take a little while to get used to this and i put this effect as one which actually <UNK> from what is happening in the story not a really good move though with somewhat frequent <UNK> of scenes involving flashbacks br br but the flock still makes decent entertainment though x <UNK> out there would probably find it hard not to picture their favourite actors in the lead roles given so much similarities in character gere and danes do put forth some chemistry as the old <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> and while it's not exactly great andrew <UNK> did manage to pull off something enjoyable
<START> there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy tale like as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the <UNK> as well as the 1990's exciting hilarious and <UNK> with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert <UNK> especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that <UNK> the viewer from start to finish br br ten stars and not a <UNK> less
<START> there are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that if executed clearly could have <UNK> it from spaghetti western <UNK> into something special unfortunately a town called hell is one of the worst edited movies imaginable scenes start and end abruptly characters leave for long stretches the performances and accents of the actors are pretty inconsistent etc br br robert shaw is a mexican revolutionary who after taking part in <UNK> out a village stays on to become a priest ten years later the village is being run by mayor telly <UNK> stella stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband colonel martin <UNK> arrives looking for shaw they all yell at each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot <UNK> <UNK> is in it too as a blind man the performances aren't bad but they are <UNK> uneven <UNK> has an accent sometimes as does <UNK> who is really grating here shaw and <UNK> prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and stevens looks pretty <UNK> if a bit out of place amongst the <UNK> filth

<START> hotel du <UNK> is the only <UNK> movie from the 1936 1946 era which has dialogs not written by jacques <UNK> but by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was much more interested in the <UNK> <UNK> couple than in the pair of lovers <UNK> <UNK> the latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the edith <UNK> song les <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> except that the <UNK> tale is a tragic one what's fascinating today is this popular little world the <UNK> saint martin settings br br this movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special reason the <UNK> <UNK> tells his <UNK> <UNK> he wants a change of air <UNK> because she does not understand the meaning of the world <UNK> the whore <UNK> wonderful <UNK> thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole french <UNK> br br in french <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> translation attempt atmosphere atmosphere have i got an atmosphere face this is our french <UNK> perfect
<START> the <UNK> may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it but that doesn't make up for the fact that it's pretty <UNK> directed and acted and with a very mediocre script br br b grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish br br it would be <UNK> to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making br br hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video br br this film will open the <UNK> film weekend in <UNK> on april 10 2002 i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the <UNK> cocktail party they're gonna need it
<START> by saying that i mean that this is not a well made movie but it's a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far and if you are a ww2 buff then this is a treat for you cause there are three out of four <UNK> members playing roles in this movie it's theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary br br me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over human heroes of the second world war and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next generations cause nowadays kids doesn't read books they watch movies br br so if you want a action <UNK> rent private ryan this is the truth about lingering pain outrageous <UNK> and the will to fight when all seems lost
<START> this movie deserved a working over on mystery science theater even though it has nothing whatever to do with king <UNK> it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh riot really it's worse than destroy all monsters be sure to check out the following the cheesy <UNK> looks like the <UNK> have been here the obviously <UNK> <UNK> jacket on allan <UNK> david <UNK> badly done <UNK> which does draw attention away from his even worse acting the incredibly bad process work on all the monsters the monsters themselves the hand puppet which <UNK> the little girl the giant snake that <UNK> <UNK> while he sinks in <UNK> the red <UNK> eyes on the <UNK> <UNK> the amazingly hilarious boat oh brother which appears to be made of <UNK> <UNK> on an old sand <UNK> and looks like a <UNK> from a jr sr prom voyage into the future with the class of <UNK> the <UNK> city where they wear roman <UNK> armor but which inexplicably has egyptian <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> invented the <UNK> come on and worst of all <UNK> and <UNK> with her fright wig playing <UNK> face oh the horror the best parts are that the <UNK> <UNK> manage to lose the comic frenchman and the african guy <UNK> or whatever evidently chose to die <UNK> rather than be in any more scenes
<START> meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby <UNK> chamberlain and using her <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario that's all too real for us in america the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy target br br lindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond <UNK> even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child the media began a <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> invasion of <UNK> that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they <UNK> this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apart br br this stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a <UNK> mother cry and <UNK> and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people don't understand that not everyone <UNK> the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin <UNK> meryl streep <UNK> this <UNK> woman to the <UNK> and in doing so creates a cold but not <UNK> woman one that stood by her <UNK> even if they cost her liberty because of her sam <UNK> is allowed to have his character slowly <UNK> into despair someone has to or the <UNK> would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media they'll always eat train <UNK> up and feed the <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> public
<START> i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel <UNK> being attacked by man eating ants what i didn't remember was how awful it was br br i recently caught this movie on television late at night i'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from <UNK> and are never to be found again suzanne <UNK> at the <UNK> of her career playing <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> plays a <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> workers are <UNK> a swimming pool outside and accidentally <UNK> an <UNK> nest or should i say a man eating <UNK> nest one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants one minute he's picking them off his clothes one by one the next minute he's covered in them the next scene shows a <UNK> in the dirt br br if you thought that was pretty far fetched you should see myrna loy playing a wheel chair bound resident who gets <UNK> out of the <UNK> via helicopter i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting <UNK> out of the movie br br the final scenes depict suzanne robert <UNK> and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other blowing through <UNK> and covered in ants br br that's basically the movie there's really no disaster appeal or big star draw to the film it was intended to be a <UNK> <UNK> television event at the time now it's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4 <UNK> <UNK> on your local television station br br if you want to catch suzanne <UNK> at her best then watch an episode of <UNK> company if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this movie br br 0 10
<START> this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very <UNK> existence however after a while the excitement begins to <UNK> and the couple become <UNK> and pointless in their existence however out of no where when they are on a luxury cruise the ship sinks and they lose everything and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life what an odd silly and preachy film personally i'd like to <UNK> all that money and find out if it makes me miserable br br the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting
<START> the <UNK> plot of dr fu <UNK> starring peter sellers in a spoof of the characters created by <UNK> rohmer is an injustice to the end of <UNK> career the plot was very simplistic and if done the right way could have been handled nicely but instead it was poorly executed part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog cheap laughs choppy directing and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat <UNK> br br the acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture i found sellers portrayal of diabolical <UNK> brilliantly done with the occasional lines that will be remembered for example there is the scene where fu <UNK> is confused which henchman is which in which he says ah you all look the same to me i hate to admit it but i laughed out loud with that line br br then of course a <UNK> of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of helen <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> david <UNK> as sir roger <UNK> his last film as well not a way to end a career and sid <UNK> who gives a rather whimsical performance of al <UNK> relative who works for the fbi these characters also kept me watching br br the sets were also nice oriental designs and english society in 1933 was depicted with <UNK> in this dud of a picture br br in all honesty my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a peter sellers or sid <UNK> fan otherwise you're better off <UNK> on chewing <UNK> foil
<START> enjoyable in spite of leslie <UNK> performance mr howard plays philip as a flat uninteresting character one is supposed to feel sorry for this man however i find myself cheering bette <UNK> mildred ms davis gives one her finest performances she received an academy award nomination thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life be sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him
<START> yes he is no not because of <UNK> likes to <UNK> his actors and show <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> is the naked emperor so to speak br br it's big time for someone to state the truth this <UNK> is a <UNK> a brat locked in an old man's body his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic <UNK> whatsoever it is 100 visual <UNK> he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their <UNK> and if he does this in front of the audience he might eve get a hard on did you know that on the set of <UNK> <UNK> he used to embarrass poor <UNK> <UNK> by telling her oh <UNK> how i wanna f you she is a great lady very decent and sensitive and she became <UNK> ashamed to his petty satisfaction and as a worrying alarm <UNK> about the degree of <UNK> and lack of education in romanian audiences so many people are still so foolish to <UNK> these visual <UNK> works of art will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all
<START> i'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well filmed and well acted out this is a romantic period film set in <UNK> century italy but filmed in french with english subtitles the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower paced than films set in the modern day era so it will bore some if you can overlook that fact it is actually a really good film the scenery the costumes and the cinematography are beautiful and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals <UNK> the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real life characters in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline i decided to check out the <UNK> of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie's story that of an sad unfinished love story was completely <UNK> br br in real life artemisia was raped by <UNK> initially rather than <UNK> to his advances willingly and <UNK> as the movie had portrayed she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her when they were in court he had not admitted guilt of rape out of pity for <UNK> torture unlike what the movie portrays in reality he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose <UNK> woman with <UNK> sexual <UNK> in the movie his sister <UNK> in court that <UNK> had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister in law and <UNK> character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been <UNK> him regarding his alleged affair with his sister in law although he admits to having had a wife back in <UNK> needless to say in reality it wasn't really like that at all in fact far from it <UNK> was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife whom he had <UNK> from rape and to add to that <UNK> really had sexual relations with his sister in law <UNK> her in the process but all this wasn't really mutual as well again he had raped his sister in law before br br so now we have a clear picture of the real <UNK> as a multiple sex <UNK> what do we make of the film <UNK> portrayal of him as a lover we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film that this film was never made to be historically accurate apart from these points just mentioned there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of <UNK> art in real life she was never really influenced by <UNK> painting style and she was actually considered a much better painter than <UNK> ever was one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia <UNK> has been credited as the first woman painter in history and although her <UNK> of the art <UNK> many of her male peers she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman in <UNK> century italy br br enjoy this film for its own sake for it is a pretty good romantic drama but take its historical references with a grain of salt
<START> it's nothing brilliant groundbreaking or innovative but <UNK> <UNK> is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study it's like crash <UNK> on a bad dose of heroin but not really it's an <UNK> film following the lives of several depressed deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other it's disturbing yet very well acted and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do certainly not for the weak hearted this highly <UNK> film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end we just see the lives of these <UNK> individuals over the course of two days grade b
<START> this movie was very funny i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days the movie is <UNK> unique in it's humor and visuals both are terrific and on par with <UNK> other more serious movie gems cube and cypher i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he's made is very interesting br br very likable about this movie are the music and loser characters dave and andrew portrayed by david <UNK> and andrew miller co writer of the story actors i both like very much also cool are the x box dead or alive fights you even see dave playing <UNK> at a point and <UNK> amazing guitar solo among many other things br br all in all a great feel good film about friendship you have to see this
<START> i'm overwhelmed by the work of jim carrey i keep on getting this movie stuck in my head the grinch liking martha may cindy lou who's very annoying her sweet innocence who tries to get the grinch in the christmas spirit the childhood of the grinch very funny and moreover the weak obvious ending with christmas isn't all about presents i have to say i felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and <UNK> laughing and so forth but this movie was a good full <UNK> adaption of dr <UNK> short film and is for all ages
<START> this movie was fantastic great movie all through scary as hell and i mean it freaked me out as much as pulse and it and the omen etc but with a great movie comes a crap ending right right this movies ending was pathetic stuff i mean a ghost turned back time in a chicks house and it thinks now i have done that it means i can call her and <UNK> be the right time cause she thinks it is right wrong my ass i don't care if the ghost is satan it just doesn't happen its a movie yes but most evil movies or praised movies like this are meant to make sense but it didn't it just showed us what i just said and people don't think anything of it can someone please tell me why you all haven't noticed that pathetic part the movie for me ended in the hospital and that is all check out number 3 its much more kick ass
<START> it's the same old if i can't get the funding for my project i'll <UNK> myself monster movie there is nothing new here it's a lot like the jeff goldblum fly movie the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity but eventually <UNK> to the effects of his experiments the acting is pretty bad there are people acting <UNK> all along the way putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son admittedly he is good looking but he seems like a lot of trouble it's just a pretty big waste of time even his <UNK> suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness much anticipated twisted comedy from writer director richard shepard is a coming out party for pierce brosnan the actor that bond guy is gone this new guy is something else entirely have read that shepard thought brosnan was too much the pretty boy for this <UNK> role but brosnan proves to be the perfect julian noble <UNK> and is anything but pretty do not <UNK> how twisted the humor is in this one if you go expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex killing religion sports business and anything else you might <UNK> politically incorrect brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his marvelous facial gestures and physical movements even sitting on a hotel bed with or without a <UNK> is a joy to behold br br greg kinnear is the straight guy to <UNK> comic and has plenty of depth and comic timing to make this <UNK> click hope davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role as <UNK> wife what's with her name bean who happens to get a little excited when she has a <UNK> in her living room br br the visuals and settings are perfect including a <UNK> <UNK> and denver <UNK> and how often do we get the killers and <UNK> <UNK> on the same soundtrack this one is definitely not for everyone but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you enjoy <UNK> film making it could be for you
<START> i didn't enjoy this movie at all for one i just found it crude and vulgar for no reason i also felt it's misogynistic against women also the movie really doesn't appear to be about anything and i didn't find any of the characters likable really the there doesn't seem to be any point to it all maybe i'm missing something but for me this movie is pretty much a waste of time when i could have been doing something more <UNK> and enjoyable like using my face as a pin <UNK> james garner is in this thing as are c thomas <UNK> and shirley jones and james <UNK> all are wasted here and i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers <UNK> harrison from the later years of <UNK> company is also in the movie and it is nice to see her in a non <UNK> role but other than that she can't rise above the mediocre script for me tank is a 3 10
<START> acting was weak but in a horror flick i can live with that if the story is good it wasn't the initial event was an clumsy and obvious <UNK> to exploit most people's <UNK> of kids ok fine fast forward to the place in the country where they will recover emotionally i like the revelation of the ghosts ok cool this will be a supernatural kinda horror story with rotting things partly in our world partly in where ever then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a <UNK> of cats and birds is there an evil force trying to attack them directly is there an evil force trying to attack them <UNK> make people do awful things they wouldn't really do oh wait no maybe the whole region is some kind of psychic echo chamber where <UNK> <UNK> can <UNK> into murder ok hold on maybe it's really just one little mentally <UNK> <UNK> style redneck boy who misses his <UNK> and is on some kind of spree like a k tel norman bates knock off oh yeah extra points off the only black character seems to be the <UNK> of an our gang <UNK> porter the actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue but the fact is his purpose is <UNK> done <UNK> get <UNK> <UNK> boss at least they wrote him smart enough to <UNK> outta there the bit with the little girl being <UNK> and pulled away was definitely creepy as was the chick in the shower those were just two of quite a few really delicious <UNK> in this movie the problem is that they are combined in <UNK> ways like a bite of <UNK> a bite of chocolate and a bite of a <UNK> bear each is great on it's own but mixed up <UNK> such potential wasted
<START> i have read several good reviews that have <UNK> and <UNK> the various aspects of this film one thing i see over and over is annoyance with <UNK> the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world i loved her character maybe because i am a 23 year old political science student and i think i'm going to change the world too so i relate to <UNK> besides she's cute she's no super model but more of a cute girl next door br br ok so she cried and screamed a lot it's very dramatic and seems overdone but doesn't it fit her character she goes on that show with the intention of <UNK> her life to prove a point she thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick i think she made her argument very well of course being a young naive girl she is terrified of what she is about to face i think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear furthermore i think she <UNK> a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in br br as for the movie in general other than <UNK> it was pretty much what i expected it had excellent gore scenes by <UNK> budget standards the plot maybe took a quick thought hardly any <UNK> it's basically just a dark <UNK> senseless slasher film which the name implies i love the <UNK> of the doctor he kept ripping <UNK> shirt off not just for the cause of sleaze though largely so but also to torment her before he kills her the chainsaw <UNK> was hilarious for slasher film lovers he was probably the best character br br i give this film 4 out of 10 it had a good setting almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting i would recommend it for a cheap thrill but hardly a diamond in the rough that is <UNK> budget horror
<START> for those who think it is strictly <UNK> humor and <UNK> you are in fact the mindless one while the show does contain its share of <UNK> jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and <UNK> fun at social problems racial <UNK> <UNK> stereotypes etc you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it br br what i also love is that not everything is a punchline for those expecting a <UNK> joke like friends i love friends <UNK> you won't find it here instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic we don't walk around in this world and have witty <UNK> for everything said which is in most comedies instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense br br so don't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that
<START> seriously i've read some of the reviews on this film and i have to ask were you people watching the same movie br br yes i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate 1930 vintage los angeles but so what br br none of the characters are likable the story seems <UNK> karen black is simply not a very good actress donald sutherland is just <UNK> and his character homer simpson makes me wish for the animated version <UNK> then you had the creepy child actor the <UNK> billy <UNK> and so on br br this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go what the heck
<START> this may be the only film that actually comes close to capturing on film the essentially <UNK> world of the american college experience of the late 60s early 70s go ahead name another movie that even approaches this one getting straight <UNK> these are caricatures return of the <UNK> seven has its moments but that's a <UNK> film about self obsessed individuals more than a film about a time and a place depicted in that time and place drive he said portrays with subtlety and nuance where it should and a swift kick in the shorts where that's the only appropriate way the anti draft movement the ambiguity of big time college sports especially when there's a war on the sexual revolution of the period and the general <UNK> of the day believe me it was like that br br the whole cast deserves <UNK> as does the director of course but particular praise should be reserved for bruce dern as the basketball coach and karen black the hero's very unusual except for that time love interest william <UNK> as the lead also rates a real round of applause both for his perfect capturing of the student <UNK> of the period and for actually playing real college basketball in the film remember anthony <UNK> in tall story <UNK> br br all in all a classic of a kind and the last film someone currently in <UNK> grade should be writing comments on boring <UNK> um right sonny please go back to your arnold movies why isn't this film available from imdb
<START> oh dear this movie was bad for various reasons i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over all score sorry but to rate this highly as many have is a joke once you get past the one shot black and white movie gimmick which was a nice idea the movie drags on even at a run time of only <UNK> minutes the credits sequence at the start was so annoying too in the van the guys suffer a flat <UNK> and change the wheel wow that was needed in the story how slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound campbell they did not seem to bother continue chasing him sigh i am only too glad i got this free with a special edition of evil dead
<START> the first time i saw this film i loved it when i was 11 i was more interested in the music and dancing as i've grown older i've become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a <UNK> of michael's career from the jackson 5 up to bad it was still entertaining to watch the <UNK> sequence could've been left out though the kids were pretty good speed demon and leave me alone were funny especially when the police officer tells michael i need your <UNK> right here after stopping him for dancing in a no dancing zone but it's smooth criminal that's the <UNK> on the cake joe <UNK> did an excellent job as the <UNK> and that hair was wild the dancing is perfect and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the <UNK> any fan of michael's should see this if you haven't already i give it a 10
<START> first thing first in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music and thats where mr <UNK> and his party fails br br music is completely pale and <UNK> on other hand there is ajay <UNK> who has removed a letter <UNK> from his spelling done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like this br br <UNK> is like a doll which is used to <UNK> public even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i don't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of band br br in nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of t watch it if you wanna get fooled
<START> worst movie on earth i don't even know where to begin but i hope i can save another person from <UNK> themselves with this movie when it comes to acting and lighting this movie is similar to a bad porno without the sex the actors are some of the worst i've ever seen and couldn't have been worse even if they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie the movie must have had a record breaking low budget which i'm sure was wasted almost solely on the movie's cover this movie has now become a running joke with friends of mine and has become the standard for comparing other garbage movies i would like to point of that no other movie even begins to compare i feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and me watch this movie and am surprised she still considers me a friend after the torment i put us through don't see this movie
<START> anyone who does not find this movie funny does not understand simple comedy this movie is not a complex comedy it is full of one liners and sight gags and will make anyone who wants to laugh laugh the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up
<START> sandra the making of a woman is a standout among exploitation films and is so for two reasons 1 an excellent yet <UNK> performance by monica <UNK> and 2 the fact that gary <UNK> was at the <UNK> of the project these two talents both of whom are quite underrated make sandra a film that should be seen br br another key element of the film's success is its realism there is nothing fake or hollywood about this set in california film it is truly a slice of life the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film the simple dresses worn by the character the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at her front door and sandra sits on the couch without make up while <UNK> tries to sell her some <UNK> looking truly as if she just woke up but nevertheless beautiful the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a <UNK> the one room apartment into which sandra moves all of these elements of the film seem totally real and as such the viewer is drawn into <UNK> little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed sandra also makes her case for free love with <UNK> and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class br br this film could have easily failed in less competent hands and could have gone off in any of the usual <UNK> directions but the <UNK> <UNK> team see to it that sandra is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film
<START> other reviewers have <UNK> this film noir well i just wanted to add to the <UNK> comment one reviewer made regarding elisha <UNK> obviously coke <UNK> <UNK> episode this was a <UNK> i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his <UNK> performance br br a bit of trivia that i am <UNK> about cook appeared as a <UNK> in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a <UNK> in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene <UNK> was <UNK> most <UNK> is it too much to suggest that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by <UNK> work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier br br if you watch <UNK> in ball of fire i think you'll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time
<START> leave it to geniuses like <UNK> <UNK> the spanish director to convince the higher ups in his country to <UNK> this misguided attempt of a film the sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material most of the pictures that are made in spain fall under two categories those about the spanish civil war that love to present past history as the writers <UNK> fit the other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the <UNK> don't have anything interest to say br br as the film opens we get to watch <UNK> penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the <UNK> at a party later on sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire the story of <UNK> attraction to sandra a married woman that seems to be happily married is false from the start br br our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier better made picture by mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but alas it has nothing to do with the mess we are <UNK> to watch in this venture as far as the comments <UNK> in imdb all the negative votes come from spanish viewers which speaks volumes coming from them
<START> when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original like <UNK> creek meets texas chainsaw massacre and i mean it only cost three <UNK> around 6 to be honest i don't think it was even worth that br br it seemed like the directors the <UNK> <UNK> couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror it ended up with a clich√© ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed br br the only good part really was the middle end i won't ruin it for you but that was the only good part br br overall a pointless watch it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes if you want an artsy film don't bother if you want a slasher movie don't bother the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening
<START> quentin crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic when things are show <UNK> grim they are realistic and when something gets the ironic treatment they're spot on unfortunately for leon de <UNK> he falls into the second <UNK> this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish ken <UNK> type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate <UNK> movies from merely being <UNK> los <UNK> al <UNK> is just that only depressing things are <UNK> grim the characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the <UNK> story isn't enough <UNK> <UNK> the tale over with a visually grey and <UNK> colour palette the films was ridiculously over rated at the <UNK> a movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed <UNK> workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though i would be the first to sympathize with the <UNK> of these people this movie only manages to make me grow <UNK> in their fate in 21st century spain unemployed people do not live like <UNK> and the public transport <UNK> have decent <UNK> and it's hard to come across a bar with so few <UNK> and such little happiness to be encountered in it leon de <UNK> obviously doesn't have a clue about working class spain and does it no <UNK> pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw the scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more <UNK> with the subject of the <UNK> trap namely purely <UNK> which is <UNK> more engaging humorous and yet sad
<START> at the start this one is from england so of course i had 98 chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema i never heard of this film before from the minute i saw helena bonham carter i said to myself oh here's comes the feminine version of my left foot i was right but i was also wrong wrong because the two movies are very <UNK> my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie not because this is funny but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality here very beautiful bonham carter did exactly the same thing but with very feminine emotions the story is well written and it's very intelligent for me miss bonham carter gives one of the greatest woman's part of the 1990's with emily lloyd in breaking the waves gee and look at her eyes she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since <UNK> <UNK> louise brooks <UNK> morgan and <UNK> <UNK> she's also a true talent as seen on many other movies see this one you won't regret it and a very fine job by branagh too
<START> perhaps i'm out of date or just don't know what <UNK> is like in current <UNK> but the <UNK> that i read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan she usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the <UNK> over your eyes and gets her way br br this movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn't particularly convincing and the action was <UNK> i was really looking for something more along the lines of frank <UNK> book <UNK> assassin which is much darker than anything in this movie br br special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical <UNK> hand was not menacing enough and <UNK> was not bitchy enough she's the girl you love to hate but in this story i just didn't care either way
<START> it is always sad when <UNK> movies such as this are overlooked by the majority of <UNK> panic is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the <UNK> of his own life br br william h macy as alex is as convincing as always this fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your <UNK> no matter how flawed his characters may be we may not always <UNK> the <UNK> of the protagonists he plays but the emotions of fear and confusion that he evokes in us are often all too painfully familiar the title panic initially seems <UNK> given the lack of overt emotion at one point alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry yet as this story unfolds it becomes increasingly obvious that rage and desperation not indifference are the driving forces behind this man's existence br br more than once i was reminded of his performance in <UNK> another strongly character driven movie in both <UNK> and panic we witness a middle aged man who somehow seems to have stepped out of <UNK> with the rest of life he has lost his way and the only way back <UNK> appears to be though the darkness he knows he is making bad choices but desperation <UNK> self control and common sense br br alex <UNK> with sarah a 23 year old woman <UNK> played by <UNK> campbell whom he meets in a doctor's office <UNK> this union is less coincidence more the work of fate alex finds a certain comfort being with sarah <UNK> perhaps that she is a fellow drifter like him someone who has lost her way and is floating <UNK> through the rest of her life waiting <UNK> for its inevitable conclusion br br <UNK> for movies such as this is a <UNK> and convincing way for <UNK> campbell to answer those critics who question her acting abilities too often it is the characters she has played who are the weakness offering campbell no depth in which to <UNK> her acting <UNK> this performance however may be an eye opener for many br br in a perfect movie world not only would there be many more films like panic but also they would reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience if you watch movies for the <UNK> and depth of characterization rather than merely the latest state of the art special effects then for you panic is <UNK> a

<START> be warned br br this is crap that other crap won't even <UNK> to be in company with because it's beneath them okay got that out of the way let me say something more <UNK> br br i've seen <UNK> of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a novel due to the <UNK> reputation of the director wong <UNK> <UNK> well despite of all of that <UNK> hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of <UNK> fans mostly it is just shots of dripping water <UNK> of <UNK> legs of horses running etc i couldn't sit through most of the movie br br fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr <UNK> movies another shot after hearing many <UNK> especially from cannes i was intrigued by his latest <UNK> a friend told me to start w <UNK> express because it is his most accessible movies so wrong i was just p o that i got <UNK> into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious <UNK> some professional reviewers mentioned it as a <UNK> on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah it's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it but no he merely shows what is faye <UNK> acting is very typical of hong <UNK> style <UNK> <UNK> deer in the <UNK> wide eye expression try to be cute and <UNK> kind of acting the rest of the cast is equally uninspired br br i think the word auteur is a <UNK> for a director who tries something new and different which is to be <UNK> but not one who hasn't yet <UNK> the art of cinematic story telling which is what mr wong is for the last 17 years

<START> i read all of nancy drew as a <UNK> and collect the books as a grown up i loved the effect used at the end and a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books <UNK> into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental <UNK> dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew just like the picture of betty <UNK> she keeps up with the times
<START> i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring true supposedly a modern <UNK> of the hitchcock original <UNK> i think <UNK> would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was <UNK> fault really i mean i'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion lol it is possible that this thing ends up <UNK> as it goes along but for me i'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 1 10
<START> the movie is boring the characters and scenarios are unrealistic unbelievable the action is hilarious this movie is a big mess it almost seems like when the action music kicks in the most impressive stunt is running either voice is dubbed over with mr <UNK> or steven sang too much and it changed his voice there is way too much dialog in this movie and extremely bad acting on <UNK> behalf the movie is great sleep therapy the fighting is laughable the eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent the main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed the main villain was used to explain the story through <UNK> he would just throw random plots in such as spoiler <UNK> his designer drug is going to be in the water supply which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie this movie is highly recommended to pass

<START> i'm a christian who generally believes in the <UNK> taught in left behind that being said i think left behind is one of the worst films i've seen in some time br br to have a good movie you need to have a well written screenplay left behind fell woefully short on this for one thing it <UNK> <UNK> from the book sometimes this is done to <UNK> a 400 page novel down to a two hour film but in this film i saw changes that made no sense whatsoever br br another thing there is zero character development when characters in the story get saved i won't say who the book makes it clear that it's a long soul searching process in the film it's quick and artificial the book is written <UNK> enough where people like <UNK> steele buck williams and <UNK> <UNK> seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial in another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind again i won't say who it seems artificial br br i realize as a christian it's <UNK> for me to say i disliked this film but i can't in a good conscience recommend a film that i feel was horribly done perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2 3 films either way christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way i realize a lot of effort probably went into left behind but that's the way i see it
<START> i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price portrays don <UNK> a magician <UNK> who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical <UNK> and also his wife portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva <UNK> even though price is a murderer i actually found myself rooting for him he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him br br although this movie doesn't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles such as my favorite house of wax it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest br br this is a must for vincent price fans
<START> i can't think of much to say about this film br br this was an awful movie i can't even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to begin br br the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond <UNK> br br the editing was poor the acting was sub par and the storyline was weak <UNK> robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american <UNK> br br if a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasn't it was just pathetic
<START> i love this movie because i grew up around <UNK> racing pat <UNK> behind the <UNK> reminds me of my father who was drawn to the <UNK> because unlike <UNK> <UNK> men of normal height and weight can be drivers br br yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but it's also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat <UNK> religious moral views <UNK> him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from today's standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment

<START> words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady really disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey <UNK> the best actor in this movie also it is rated <UNK> 17 <UNK> away the only people that might tolerate it
<START> first of all i'd just like to say this movie <UNK> more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has <UNK> up out of its <UNK> <UNK> is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle it has all of the classic elements of a late 80's early 90's action film the random gratuitous acts of violence ie when walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money the <UNK> of <UNK> the guys on fire the guys that get blown off buildings and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as let's go sit out on the deck and others that make this film a top buy off of the <UNK> rack at the local video store if you have a <UNK> for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your <UNK>
<START> imagine the big chill with a cast of twenty somethings whose characters are all unlikable and an <UNK> like man lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the <UNK> <UNK> on the positive side the movie does not <UNK> on showing the monster there's no <UNK> a boo shots or <UNK> scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like he's right out there folks unfortunately the design and construction aren't that inspired a little bit of mystery might have helped mind you i've seen far worse but if you're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick your monster better look damn good br br spoiler ahead br br oh and there's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script as for the acting well let's just say it wasn't painfully bad but i don't expect we'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic <UNK> br br gore <UNK> 2 out of 5 nudity <UNK> 1 out of 5 intelligence <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i didn't think it could be done but something has come along and replaced open house a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate as the worst film i've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life br br it was <UNK> as the best film in <UNK> most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry br br watching this movie was like a little slice of hell it's from <UNK> and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of short cuts and blue <UNK> scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark <UNK> there's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who <UNK> for him the skinny <UNK> whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the <UNK> room of his dead child the <UNK> annoying woman <UNK> who <UNK> top ten lists the list goes on forever much like the two hours plus i spent in that theatre br br yes the characters interact but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way i couldn't say if they were any good as actors as according to the subtitles they were given lines that were the <UNK> equivalent of you are so lame they certainly didn't have to learn many as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene br br this is no <UNK> or any of the aforementioned movies there is no art to discover and nothing to <UNK> on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your never walk out during a movie policy which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene and if that sounds <UNK> it's not unless you're one of few who doesn't find the idea of your parents having sex and with a few local middle aged couples to boot revolting br br this movie was offensive to me not the <UNK> nudity not the cringe inducing soundtrack not the <UNK> scenes involving guns i was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding i was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see dog days and come out wondering if that was the best us <UNK> could find most of all i was offended that somehow the people involved with the festival <UNK> everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and <UNK> new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a <UNK> br br
<START> how does a <UNK> in a <UNK> make love in the <UNK> purple heather very very carefully now i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in scotland far too many americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously it's a joke people four legs good two legs bad as <UNK> had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic <UNK> production of <UNK> would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his <UNK> with all the authority of a man whose great <UNK> once stepped off the train at <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> enemy where would the <UNK> be without them to hate and blame for everything <UNK> roth cox and hurt should be ashamed for <UNK> in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison and at least alan <UNK> was funny
<START> this weekend just passed i watched 28 weeks later which was very good after that i watched this film br br i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch the scenes were unrealistic there was no script and no plot the alien creature was unreal and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight and to make it worse the guy named cody had an <UNK> loose filthy tongue which <UNK> attention from the main film br br forget about this movie rather go and watch 28 weeks later br br cheers <UNK> c

<START> the film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with <UNK> and <UNK> in lead roles br br the film finally was made now with <UNK> shah directing it and ajay and salman starring together after a decade hum <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> 1999 br br the movie however falls short due to it's 90's handling and worst it's <UNK> br br the film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also <UNK> the love triangle br br everything is predictable and <UNK> and too clich√©d br br there are <UNK> like how ajay runs away from london airport and makes a place for himself with no one even the way he starts his band is not convincing the second half gets better with the twist in the tale of ajay destroying salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad note br br direction by <UNK> shah is ordinary to below average music is the worst point most songs are mediocre br br amongst actors ajay gives his best shot though he isn't convincing as a rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role salman however <UNK> with his <UNK> and talking nonsense he only <UNK> when he gets drugged and <UNK> <UNK> is nothing great just a show piece <UNK> should stick to mtv <UNK> <UNK> is okay
<START> with nothing better to do i decided to check out aztec rex as it was being billed for the hell of it br br the silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing they actually looked like <UNK> those rough designs that artists later use to finish the cgi effects adding more details <UNK> movements etc absolutely awful looking dinosaurs which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit through this anyway br br the one redeeming factor was the lovely <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> she kept my interest if only the budget had been <UNK> up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used br br disappointing at least the cast and crew got a free trip to hawaii where the movie was filmed
<START> this was a truly bad film the character cole played by michael <UNK> was the biggest reason this <UNK> the actor felt that <UNK> up an unbelievably awkward southern <UNK> would make this character more evil it didn't after about 20 minutes i had wished for a speech <UNK> to make an appearance this would have added some sincerity br br 1 badly acted 2 unsympathetic characters 3 razor thin plot line br br <UNK> br br
<START> a movie made for contemporary audience the masses get to see what they want to see action comedy drama and of course <UNK> scenes as well this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family it isn't for eyes of children i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes br br if it is just entertainment you are looking for then this movie has it all the songs are catchy a lavish production i must add br br however the message of the movie is not universal it <UNK> on the idea of <UNK> that is if you do good you will get good and if you do evil you will get evil the fruit of good deeds is good while the fruit of evil is evil br br in real life this is not always true it is well known that most people do not get justice in this world while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end there are many who escape and then there are many people who do good and yet in return they meet with a sorry end br br if you don't care about the message and all you want is an escape from <UNK> reality this movie is an entertainer alright
<START> i really enjoyed this episode seeing the flash cyborg green arrow and <UNK> even though all he did was swim made my eyes <UNK> to see most of the <UNK> of the justice league trying to bring down lex luthor is what i've been waiting for this sounds a bit off topic but making a live action justice league show would definitely make me have a reason to <UNK> everything that i usually do during the week down the drain just to watch one episode this is the thrill i got from watching this episode i wish they had made this episode a little longer like a two hour special because i felt that one hour of the justice league wasn't enough now before i bore you unless i already have with my rambling i just want to say <UNK> is cool again it sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on <UNK> but i'm sure the writers will just fall back into that loop hole so enjoy this episode who knows when another good one's going to come out catch it again this <UNK> <UNK> 22 if you missed the first airing
<START> having heard of modesty blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and i liked the film a lot it delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background br br although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written sadly this is also where a major <UNK> of the movie is revealed an intimate play lives on the <UNK> of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered while alexandra <UNK> did an excellent job as modesty blaise her counterpart <UNK> coaster <UNK> as the villain <UNK> did not smiling his way through the plot as if it is an <UNK> <UNK> commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece the supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and <UNK> to decent performances from fred <UNK> as professor <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK>
<START> following a roughly 7 year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a <UNK> hard core of hard <UNK> of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street 1993 99 was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just <UNK> but too small to get a case of <UNK> ratings <UNK> over br br during the <UNK> <UNK> on friday <UNK> they had presented some of the best and most <UNK> artistic of <UNK> dramas there i've said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious <UNK> politically correct preaching br br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this 2 hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past <UNK> happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off br br our <UNK> as we join the story we find that <UNK> homicide unit commanding officer lt al <UNK> has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but <UNK> isn't ready to really <UNK> <UNK> yet so instead of a <UNK> chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of <UNK> city ' br br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an <UNK> bullet alive but in a <UNK> state he is taken to the hospital br br news <UNK> quickly and as if officially <UNK> we find all of the detectives of the <UNK> unit we've seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present <UNK> as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead br br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to <UNK> ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we'll leave that as classified br br in <UNK> up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our <UNK> as for <UNK> the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn't score as high as a typical weekly episode
<START> criminally insane 2 is included on the new dvd of <UNK> black wedding criminally insane and it's a good thing too because when i've seen a movie and know there's a sequel especially something that's as obscure as this i'm always curious i've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again most of <UNK> is nothing but flashbacks to <UNK> and footage of <UNK> asleep <UNK> fond memories i guess thanks to <UNK> 13 she's released from <UNK> state wonder if she got to see the <UNK> play while she was there and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that <UNK> promptly takes to calling <UNK> this is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic and it's even complete with a couple of rolls of course <UNK> does her thing which is to <UNK> anyone between her and food especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and <UNK> her <UNK> also you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big <UNK> full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink guess that's all a matter of misguided trust if you liked or disliked criminally insane either way there's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity one wonders why the makers of this even bothered 2 out of 10
<START> i just can't understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy meets girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by <UNK> talk about winning the gene pool <UNK> is as <UNK> and <UNK> as ever who says the golden age of cinema is dead and <UNK> holds his own br br there is <UNK> chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get together br br ignore the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be <UNK> br br ps i am 33 male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess
<START> alright this film is the representation of several things for starters this film is about a disgruntled student who brings a gun to school and shoots roughly 9 students one student survives and is in the hospital with extensive head <UNK> the lead character is what several people who consider a <UNK> <UNK> despite the movie's stating of her not being so she seems quite mysterious but was also the only <UNK> student in the <UNK> <UNK> she's <UNK> due to having a history of knowing the <UNK> and having a record of being on the phone with him the night before anyhow she's a very brief and distant person who seems to despise society yet due to some at first unexplained events she spent roughly a year out of school failing the grade she has the desire to graduate and the principle practically cons her into the only possible way she can pass is to spend time with the survivor the girl in the hospital br br these two leads are nearly entirely opposite and they are quite that on a social level while <UNK> is a quiet <UNK> disturbed anti social <UNK> girl who spends her time entirely alone even though she seems to read quite often somewhat of a closet out of the closet <UNK> the other girl is a rich popular <UNK> girl who seems always incredibly optimistic and trapped in her own fantasy world ignoring the outside world and its realism to survive i feel both of these roles to a marvelous job of representing most <UNK> in the modern <UNK> but more importantly shows how two entirely opposite girls who know nothing of each other eventually open to each other while the injured girl learns a deep meaningful truth on her once <UNK> life and the outside world <UNK> learns that complete <UNK> of society and <UNK> everything inside is not always the best thing br br many people will look to the connection between these two girls and see one of two things either a <UNK> hateful girl who wants he rest of the world to suffer as she does taking it out on an innocent girl or the story of a seemingly trapped <UNK> girl who meets an <UNK> to society and learns not only not to judge but that she is actually perhaps one of the most intelligent people she's known in other words people may see this film as a focus on <UNK> teaching the other girl a lesson about life but it isn't about that br br this film is about several things while it is about all i have stated it is also representative of how people deal from a large life changing catastrophe truly this movie is not very symbolic but instead incredibly straight forward with its message as long as you aren't afraid to open your mind and your heart to some emotions you may not be familiar with being portrayed so miraculously br br overall this film is one of the best i've ever seen the acting is brilliant the storyline and representation is deep and meaningful and the emotion flowing through out this film will have anyone not only relating but possibly crying this film is by far heart wrenching and very <UNK> and if i ever believed any film could alter a person's life this would be the first that could have changed mine br br i <UNK> this movie if you ever want a movie that's moving and <UNK> while incredibly entertaining and real watch this
<START> based on an actual mining disaster this early german <UNK> with english subtitles still remains one of the most effective <UNK> dramas ever filmed featuring many non professional actors <UNK> gives a chilling view of the friendship that <UNK> the mine workers regardless of which side of the french german border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone <UNK> any <UNK> orders a fellow <UNK> in need will receive the help of his <UNK> even at threat of great loss including life br br this film reminds of the self <UNK> <UNK> shown by the <UNK> following the 9 11 attacks putting aside any <UNK> rules and <UNK> these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives and to find their fellow fire fighters more than 70 years later <UNK> still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed
<START> i am decidedly not in the target audience for this film i am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film this happened quite by accident with the discovery of a movie called <UNK> late one night on television the first two things i noticed about that film were that it was 1 technically amateurish and 2 brilliantly written when i read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was <UNK> i started to get interesting when he said his main influence was the station agent a movie i'd seen on dvd a week prior i decided i had to go and check it out the result could be described along the same lines as <UNK> although the two films are nothing alike content wise both films suffer from technical <UNK> that are overcome through amazing writing whereas <UNK> is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation less like me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy he's always running one way or another filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones the themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant i can tell from watching it that not much has changed since i was growing up young men still have the same problems they always have the writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully honest characters and has them do completely believable things as far as indie cinema goes this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint but from an artistic one it is very close
<START> the house that <UNK> blood is one of the better anthology films of the time period br br spoilers br br tracking down a missing film star inspector <UNK> john bennett finds that the last reported <UNK> was in a large mansion in the countryside during the course of looking through the house he is told four different stories about past residents of the house br br the good story s method for murder moving into the mysterious <UNK> to get some peace and quiet while charles <UNK> his latest <UNK> horror novelist charles <UNK> <UNK> elliott and his wife alice joanna <UNK> are thrilled with the story which centers around a serial <UNK> named dominic after a series of strange <UNK> and experiences in the house charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife probably one of the better entries in the film it's easily the <UNK> the atmosphere here is what sets it apart the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep out moment the classic moment is the kill in the <UNK> office which is an all time high for creepiness the build up to it with the <UNK> sounds quick flashes of a mysterious being and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor br br <UNK> for the sweet moving into a new house widower john reid christopher lee hires former school teacher ann norton <UNK> dawn porter for his young daughter jane chloe <UNK> while he's away on business ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane's past which john <UNK> <UNK> when she learns the true nature of what has happened it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible with the <UNK> outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories this is a quite pleasant entry the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out with small amounts of clues <UNK> up here and there and the final revelation is downright nerve <UNK> that part alone is the main reason why this one works and lee doesn't harm it either br br the bad story s <UNK> tortured by memories of his lost love phillip grayson peter cushing and his friend <UNK> rogers <UNK> <UNK> both become <UNK> with a statue of a woman in a wax museum as the statue takes over their lives they discover a shocking secret about the museum that <UNK> the both of them there's a clever premise here and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum which are always creepy this is no exception and it looks eerie which is helped by the <UNK> lighting on display on the <UNK> a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace it takes a long time for events to unfold out and most of the time is spent on exposition it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away those really lower this one a bit had the twist been changed it would've scored higher the rest is acceptable br br the cloak veteran horror film actor paul henderson jon pertwee upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a <UNK> store the cloak soon turns him into a vampire going crazy on the set with co star carla ingrid pitt and other <UNK> acts at home <UNK> the cloak is the cause he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination this has a pretty decent premise and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares but what sinks it is several factors first it's just too goofy for it's own good the plot twist at the end is a perfect example which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all and just comes across as just plain silly there's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through it's the weakest one in the film br br the final verdict a quite decent <UNK> film there's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that <UNK> this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films br br today's rating pg 13 violence
<START> this is a truly classic movie in its story acting and film presentation wonderful actors are <UNK> throughout the whole movie miss sullivan and jimmy stewart being the foremost characters in real life she greatly admired and liked jimmy and indeed gave him his basically first acting roles and helped him be more calm with his appearance on the set the chemistry between the two was always apparent and so warm and enjoyable to behold she was such a beautiful young woman and so sweet in her personality portrayals the story of these two young people and how they eventually come together in the end is charming to watch and pure magical entertainment heart warming <UNK> are also given by the other supporting actors in this marvelous story movie i whole <UNK> give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic that has a special appeal for all generations a must see for all
<START> summer holiday is the forgotten musical version of eugene <UNK> ah wilderness and deservedly so with the broadway musical adaptation of take me along with the exception of the stanley <UNK> song none of the other harry warren ralph <UNK> songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable br br it was right after the release of this film that mgm let mickey rooney go and i don't think it was a coincidence the film was made in 1946 and released in 1948 so mickey was 26 playing an andy hardy like teenager he was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion br br rooney made four films for mgm from 1946 to 1948 this one killer mccoy a remake of robert <UNK> a crowd <UNK> love laughs at andy hardy and words and music in all of them rooney was playing an adult part even in the andy hardy film mickey played an adult andy hardy returned from world war ii why he was in this louis b <UNK> only knows br br <UNK> bad casting makes summer holiday all the worse because in the original ah wilderness the emphasis is on the father's character played here by walter huston and in the broadway show take me along which won a tony award for jackie <UNK> the great one played the <UNK> brother in law uncle sid here played by frank morgan and that's the central character br br gloria <UNK> steps in for judy garland as <UNK> sweet and adorable girl friend and marilyn <UNK> plays the show girl who gives rooney an adult education in the original play o'neill has her as a prostitute but this was the hollywood of the code so all marilyn does is get young rooney <UNK> br br a lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best but summer holiday fades rather quickly into a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is <UNK> through the reviews that <UNK> appear on this film's imdb space i saw this movie courtesy of subway <UNK> new york asian film festival which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year see vital snake of june <UNK> no <UNK> survive style and have <UNK> every day that a scene from that movie <UNK> itself from the back of my mind and becomes a vivid memory br br i'm sure that you can read a <UNK> summary of the film off of subway cinema which is probably why i made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film the description built up the kind of horror film that i had <UNK> for for a while one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares p was in fact different it relied on cheap laughs br br the incredibly annoying <UNK> described this movie as lesbians team up to fight monsters completely untrue there is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and <UNK> is actually going somewhere more lies this film seems like a short made for are you afraid of the dark the story is ridiculous and only succeeded in <UNK> laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally <UNK> their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the 9 that they wasted at the door i almost wish paul <UNK> was in the audience so that i could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad <UNK> horror <UNK> porn that belongs on the spice channel which only succeeded to get the actress <UNK> from her family and caused a minor stir at the <UNK> film festival the only stir that this caused was a <UNK> in the lower <UNK> as it couldn't <UNK> itself from the sh <UNK> that it is anyway i hope i can <UNK> anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences knocking out <UNK> for the number 2
<START> as a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent this prequel has none of those aforementioned <UNK> going for it the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous unbelievable this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to <UNK> not that teens don't love virtual reality <UNK> <UNK> filled with sex violence heavy dance music its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth reason or political religious passion as to create such futuristic <UNK> or become suicide <UNK> that <UNK> me these kids are definitely not from this planet the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting the scene with eric <UNK> giving his cyborg a <UNK> <UNK> via the student <UNK> <UNK> was amusing if not entertaining but this old concept was far better portrayed much more believable in the brilliant classic original frankenstein with boris karloff caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film no surprise there overall this movie was bland unoriginal cheap looking using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg i doubt i'll be watching this space soap when it <UNK> on the sci fi channel unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure <UNK>
<START> this is without a doubt the funniest of the curly stooges shorts i've seen it dozens of times and it always makes me laugh hilarious <UNK> sequences a perfect example of musical comedy even people who don't like the <UNK> remember this one <UNK>
<START> malcolm mcdowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different especially designed for people who like yellow <UNK> on their movies
<START> <UNK> i don't what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john <UNK> early offerings perhaps i should take that back i don't want to insult <UNK> ability as a director <UNK> br br i particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility <UNK> it's full faith and credit by the way br br this also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multi involved <UNK> such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability albeit a stunt some might say to pull something off like that
<START> a great movie rather challenging than really entertaining sadly no memorable quotes here but this one's my favorite alexandre if you're leaving someone that you have loved you have to say what i'm telling you now farewell i'm going but to disappear to hide like a criminal is <UNK> didn't watch it with english subtitles br br in my opinion this expresses it all there is so much tactics involved in the relationships between alexandre and the others and yet everyone <UNK> for a little bit more truth however knowing the truth can hurt even more as alexandre experiences common interpretation is that the movie <UNK> the mere possibility of <UNK> love by depicting the <UNK> <UNK> on the people involved it does indeed show this in a convincing manner but i would appreciate it if the reasons had been treated a bit more in depth it's not that <UNK> love is in itself doomed to failure but people especially men i think should work on themselves and try to overcome the <UNK> morals before and not through practicing <UNK> love br br that said the movie's realistic though and really worthwhile watching
<START> the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all time and such a disappointment i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should br br <UNK> <UNK> 0 10 no stars f
<START> i watched this movie at a sneak preview screening and i'm glad i didn't pay for it this movie is just disgusting its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences such as the shootout in little germany i made a little list of things i enjoyed in the movie and a lot of which i didn't agree of br br 1 dave <UNK> penis 2 the fart jokes 3 the <UNK> jokes 4 the dude was a <UNK> 5 no gary coleman 6 the <UNK> 7 again making fun of bush we get it he's an idiot move on 8 the dude has blonde hair 9 the plot 10 the killing of <UNK> 11 uwe boll was in it 12 most of the cast were just <UNK> and out there br br now the few good ones br br 1 the dude uses a cat as a <UNK> like in the game 2 lots of action 3 <UNK> made a return and a cameo of the maker of <UNK> 4 <UNK> i didn't have to pay for it 5 there are a few what the <UNK> moments br br boll did it again he made another crappy game into movie adaption kudos to you mr boll 2 10
<START> i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who <UNK> on about what a cute story this was br br <UNK> br br i want my two hours back as i could have done so many more <UNK> things with my time like for instance <UNK> my thumbs i see nothing redeeming about this film at all save for the eye candy aspect of it br br 3 10 and that's being generous
<START> i thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies i have ever seen the others being the christmas wife and jack frost all three movies are about death if you like being thoroughly depressed then by all means watch this film or any of the others in this film the acting is good and some of the scenery apart when people are dying is lovely but i am worried that a <UNK> depressed person might accidentally see the film and do themselves in despite a happily ever after ending the major portion of this film is one awful disaster following another and for some crazy reason i don't want to be depressed when i watch a christmas movie i know this sounds crazy folks after all isn't <UNK> your eyes out and feeling miserable what the holidays are all about anyway br br for a more uplifting viewing experience try the forgotten house without a christmas tree george c scott's christmas carol or a christmas story instead unless of course you like being miserable
<START> <UNK> the sidewalk ends 1950 ' opens appropriately with dana <UNK> and gene <UNK> names <UNK> on the sidewalk as dirty water <UNK> down between the bars of a <UNK> <UNK> the sidewalk represents <UNK> integrity and morality ¬ñ only crooks and <UNK> walk in the <UNK> but even the most <UNK> of men have a tendency to <UNK> on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet mark dixon dana andrews was born in the <UNK> his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life <UNK> his way back onto the sidewalk <UNK> balanced on the edge of the <UNK> as a police detective dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a mean streak that he can't escape when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he <UNK> a cheap criminal <UNK> cheat and lie to cover up his <UNK> br br <UNK> the sidewalk <UNK> was the only film to reunite dana andrews gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb <UNK> 1944 ' though the two films as far as noir goes couldn't be further apart whereas the earlier picture had the strong <UNK> of a country house murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama given her <UNK> memorable performance as laura hunt it's unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused <UNK> the typical <UNK> of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in jules <UNK> 'the night and the city 1950 ' andrews on the other hand has rarely been better <UNK> a <UNK> and unhinged anger that i hadn't expected of him gary <UNK> is suitably smug as the crime boss <UNK> but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role and i think that an actor like richard <UNK> who played mr brown in 'the big <UNK> 1955 ' would have better suited the character i hadn't realised this but <UNK> appeared just one year earlier in <UNK> <UNK> 1949 ' br br the tension as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting ¬ñ certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era ¬ñ though i feel that the situation still wasn't exploited to its full potential the taxi driver is the only person who could have <UNK> identified dixon as the <UNK> but preminger <UNK> <UNK> over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs had the witness been brought in as dixon was re <UNK> his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks and why for that matter couldn't the taxi <UNK> <UNK> have immediately <UNK> <UNK> taylor tom <UNK> from suspicion of murder <UNK> inconsistencies such as these <UNK> an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben <UNK> who <UNK> his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> law <UNK> tormented by rage and <UNK> has rarely been done better at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas <UNK> <UNK> dangerous ground <UNK> '
<START> i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff <UNK> by the performances and visuals whatever the case i'm sure i loved it from the wonderfully twisted lurid <UNK> stories to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone to the vivid <UNK> colour with which it's all captured this is high class trash and it's great fun not to mention the <UNK> sly and <UNK> <UNK> sexual <UNK> which <UNK> the entire film always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so i'd be lying if i said that the film's sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it but there's some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional or was it comedy and i really really <UNK> that i could really get into this melodrama stuff
<START> an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the <UNK> to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrix br br but it's not only the same lame film as art speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological <UNK> it ego super ego <UNK> phase sexual <UNK> br br it is <UNK> with the cheesy effect of having <UNK> edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is <UNK> speaking <UNK> br br to put it in <UNK> own words i saw 5 7 on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie maker br br mr zizek what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you two points only and may god have mercy on your soul
<START> today actresses happily gain weight <UNK> their hair dress like <UNK> and lose their <UNK> for a role and bette davis was probably the actress who started the trend even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and <UNK> bennett type makeup in films davis was willing to <UNK> herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside br br her determination is <UNK> demonstrated here in her <UNK> film of human bondage in which she stars with leslie howard as philip carey davis plays mildred a <UNK> manipulative greedy low life to <UNK> <UNK> club <UNK> philip he first meets her when she's a waitress and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she <UNK> with a wealthy older man alan hale sr in truth mildred is <UNK> by <UNK> club foot on his part philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open <UNK> and her <UNK> toward him he allows mildred to bleed him dry <UNK> in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women kay johnson and frances dee when he gets the <UNK> to throw her out mildred <UNK> his apartment and <UNK> him forcing him to <UNK> from medical school and lose his <UNK> br br of human bondage looks rather stilted today in parts though leslie howard was a wonderful actor and attractive his acting style is of a more <UNK> old school and as a result he tends to date whatever he's in he shines in material like his role opposite davis in it's love i'm after or the <UNK> forest which call for his kind of technique his dated acting is even more obvious here because davis was <UNK> new ground with a gritty edgy performance that would really make her name if she seems at times over the top she came from the stage and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her contrast this performance with the restraint warmth and <UNK> of her <UNK> in all this and heaven too or the pathos she brought to dark victory she was a true actress and a true artist davis really allows herself to look like holy hell <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely pathetic as philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades br br an excellent film in which to see the <UNK> of one of film's greatest stars
<START> this 1934 adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on <UNK> so her studio didn't push for her her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards as the heartless waitress who <UNK> philip a sensitive medical student around and nearly ruins his life davis is way too shrill almost demonic director john <UNK> who usually <UNK> good performances from his actresses was perhaps overwhelmed by this one davis is watchable for sure but so <UNK> and <UNK> as to seem <UNK> human i imagine the character of <UNK> as <UNK> less feminine than davis with maybe a touch of the <UNK> davis is such a strong immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her which makes <UNK> attraction to her seem more overtly <UNK> than it should be br br as philip leslie howard is excellent his wan somewhat <UNK> good looks are perfect for this failed <UNK> nor does he <UNK> a personal interpretation on the part as say <UNK> <UNK> might have done which gives his work a rare clarity he seems completely in control here as he should be playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand howard was a fine actor too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm which he doesn't use here br br it's been so long since i've read the book i don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's <UNK> to it i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey the sexual <UNK> are muted and at times philip behaves so <UNK> that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity surely not mr <UNK> intention thanks to <UNK> performance philip remains firmly in focus as one can see in his various <UNK> to and <UNK> for <UNK> the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational in himself and in others br br overall a very good film a little stilted at times due to its age it evokes london nicely and is well acted for the most part
<START> not very impressed its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film because there is almost no development in the plot everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry the acting seems very poor as well and reminds me of the old black and white <UNK> era films shown occasionally on daytime chinese television although this is difficult to tell with the female role <UNK> as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden <UNK> it reminds me of <UNK> star <UNK> li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the west for having a <UNK> on her face all the time br br <UNK> <UNK> film the <UNK> <UNK> was a far better film but don't be fooled by the fact that <UNK> in a small town was set in the late <UNK> unlike the blue <UNK> the fact that this film is set in a time of <UNK> is irrelevant to the plot itself the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a <UNK> backdrop br br i wonder whether <UNK> <UNK> is simply trying to ride on the popularity of chinese films in the west and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> and one that is simply tedious and <UNK> br br if any film fits the description of <UNK> ' this is it i see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the chinese film industry
<START> i've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini series planet earth narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough nevertheless whether it was screened down here in australia or not i never caught up with it and when i happened upon the opportunity to see <UNK> 2007 ' ¬ñ a feature length <UNK> of the same nature footage ¬ñ on the big screen i jumped at the chance the theatre was basically empty just one other <UNK> sat in the row ahead of me and it was as though i had not only the big screen to myself but indeed the entire planet earth for 90 minutes i was <UNK> into the beauty and <UNK> of the isolated wilderness amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film awesome in its scope and yet painfully intimate at times <UNK> is a heartfelt <UNK> from the filmmakers to <UNK> the delicate balance of life on our planet and how the <UNK> of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of <UNK> br br though the film directed by <UNK> <UNK> and mark <UNK> obviously <UNK> for the <UNK> of the wilderness it <UNK> from beating us over the head with propaganda and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether indeed there is not a human in sight instead we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the <UNK> of the natural world to experience the <UNK> and also the <UNK> of life on earth i hear that the original mini series which ran for eleven episodes <UNK> a lot deeper into the scientific background of world <UNK> but i think that here the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact i can't remember the last time that i felt so inspired and yet utterly <UNK> at the same time by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a <UNK> few individual animals <UNK> them to an extent we are suddenly able to appreciate the human side of each species and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a <UNK> and more an <UNK> tragedy br br <UNK> is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young <UNK> to the <UNK> ice or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life saving <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death most <UNK> <UNK> in the desperate ballet of predator prey interactions though occasionally perhaps to <UNK> towards a younger audience the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment i regularly shed at tear at the <UNK> of death in nature and the raw instinct that <UNK> these <UNK> final hopeless efforts at survival there's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt both in the slow motion footage of a <UNK> bringing down its prey the result of a single <UNK> <UNK> or the <UNK> mid air leap of a great white shark as it <UNK> a hapless sea lion it is this <UNK> balance that has been <UNK> <UNK> by the <UNK> of our own species br br aside from these main stories we are also treated to brief snippets of <UNK> from around the world including the birds of paradise of <UNK> new guinea and the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of course entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone and an inevitable consequence of having to <UNK> through so much footage is that some interesting <UNK> are <UNK> over far took quickly by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear elephant and <UNK> whale ¬ñ <UNK> their <UNK> via some astonishing high definition time <UNK> photography throughout a <UNK> year ¬ñ the filmmakers were able to avoid any <UNK> problems that might <UNK> from having so much to show and only 90 minutes to show it consequently <UNK> left me <UNK> for more and fortunately i now have approximately eleven hours more as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box set for planet earth uplifting and tear <UNK> awe inspiring and <UNK> <UNK> is a truly magnificent documentary experience and it might just be my favourite film of 2007
<START> i've seen the thin man series powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and <UNK> chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to <UNK> and lock lips with powell there seems to be no end to his lovable playful <UNK> <UNK> character lawrence <UNK> is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too <UNK> but i can't help myself
<START> i remember this series so well it was excellent such strong and compelling characters stylish and sexy and so different to everything else on offer at the time and now i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama <UNK> br br both season 1 and season 2 are available on dvd region 2 in the uk its a treat to watch the series again br br season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes br br unfortunately it seems to have ended after 2 seasons br br this series was a lot of fun br br sometimes you can get it on special at amazon co uk
<START> this is one of the worst b slashers i've ever seen in my life the ending is something you have to see to believe br br the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the <UNK> while dressed in a santa suit he puts the presents under the tree eats the <UNK> and milk and then goes back up the <UNK> phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually <UNK> his mother then harry goes up stairs <UNK> a snow globe grabs a <UNK> of glass and cuts himself br br then you move on to the present you see harry he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of <UNK> he has two books one book for good kids and the other for bad kids he writes down everything they do in these books the guy is a creep he also works at the jolly dream toy factory his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house br br when harry finds out that his boss only cares about <UNK> he goes and <UNK> all the toys and delivers them to a few kids then he travels to a church and kills 4 people then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree the kids catch him but they go back to bed so harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves br br as he is walking towards a house a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him the <UNK> are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don't get hurt how do they know that harry is the killer sure you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids br br when harry runs off the <UNK> light <UNK> and follow him to kill him they don't even know that he is the killer when harry reaches his brother's house his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip <UNK> him he only loses consciousness phillip loads harry back into his van when harry wakes up he takes off br br the ending is something i could not believe once again you'll have to see it to believe it br br one thing that <UNK> me was the black santa that's right the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man so why did they bring in a black man br br skip this and see silent night deadly night and <UNK> <UNK> you'll get your <UNK> worth seeing those two films they are better than this pile of garbage i give this movie 1 star out of 10 wish i could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves
<START> the anime that got me hooked on anime br br set in the year <UNK> hey that's not too far away now the earth is now poison gas <UNK> of <UNK> and violence seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists the government of the fictional new <UNK> city form the tank police to deal with the problem cops with tanks oh the insanity br br the heroes of this series include the new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a red haired japanese woman yeah i know they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance who has just been <UNK> into the tank police and is quickly <UNK> with blond blue eyed nice guy al <UNK> is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain also known as <UNK> a big guy who looks like tom <UNK> on <UNK> and sporting a pair of nifty <UNK> a big revolver and a bad temper britain didn't like having <UNK> join the tank police in the first place and her <UNK> his tiger special a giant green monster tank doesn't exactly <UNK> her to him nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini tank that she <UNK> <UNK> and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child <UNK> where the boys are more your size as he puts it there's also <UNK> the <UNK> genius bible <UNK> god <UNK> <UNK> purple mo <UNK> <UNK> and the pot <UNK> chief who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them they're not very well liked by the people br br the villains are a cyborg named <UNK> who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as green peace his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg <UNK> anna <UNK> <UNK> in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal <UNK> <UNK> from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked <UNK> the story however was <UNK> in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic manga book that's very hard to find br br all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that <UNK> how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get <UNK> this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it you'd better go get quentin tarantino uneven in places but still a lot of fun br br followed by new <UNK> tank police
<START> this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great <UNK> to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone who's into thrillers it will not disappoint you
<START> a film with very little positive to say for it br br firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama br br besides being remarkably slow the empty <UNK> seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again i lost count of how many times i had seen that field at night or that bit of <UNK> earth br br it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be <UNK> rather than just confused so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine we find <UNK> is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless <UNK> beth has a key to a warehouse of books there are <UNK> other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too late br br and on the point of the <UNK> horror filmmakers note that large <UNK> objects are <UNK> not scary ¬ñ and also if they're meant to be an <UNK> big then make them so br br there is also a frightening lack of <UNK> as beth the best performer in the piece followed by <UNK> ¬ñ the cop suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on <UNK> br br with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child did he crawl out of the window he's six months old the film <UNK> into badly written scene after badly written scene bad <UNK> <UNK> horror music fails to add atmosphere br br often bad films can be amusing but not the empty <UNK> which is just bad
<START> br br this movie sucks big time it reminded me of the movie <UNK> christopher <UNK> which i also found extremely boring and <UNK> santa is in every way an even <UNK> movie br br only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history i loved her <UNK> looks in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i will not spend more time dealing with this movie i will say another good thing about this movie use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly
<START> eyes of the werewolf 1999 is a really bad movie the premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible i wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of <UNK> it into production some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out who is that weird little <UNK> who helps him out and what's up with that female cop if you really want to find out check out eyes of the werewolf br br not a bad idea for a movie i just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre production before they decided to shoot the movie
<START> a wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that <UNK> you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way one <UNK> at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well this is possibly <UNK> best performance certainly his most natural <UNK> <UNK> performs <UNK> in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including <UNK> sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age <UNK> <UNK> is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play initially this seems a down and dirty <UNK> rant romp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges in the end this <UNK> and daring film demands respect
<START> this is probably the worst movie ever made it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it i could've understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets but nowadays there is no excuses for giving birth to this i'm a b movie <UNK> and from certain people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst it's hard to imagine vampires with no <UNK> the music score is totally out of place the sound effects are just not effective and finally mr savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause he had a not to bad career over all let me know <UNK> i'm to hard on this one cause when i don't like a movie i tend to forget about it's good side
<START> i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is <UNK> the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves i e what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the <UNK> of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and <UNK> her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to <UNK> a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions
<START> this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or <UNK> the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the <UNK> <UNK> tom hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt <UNK> <UNK> although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high <UNK> if he were a woman they'd have had him playing the mother of a high <UNK> is is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the plot who cares typical teen <UNK> played by adults
<START> we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating not knowing anything about this true story i thought oh no p brosnan as an american indian <UNK> indian in the film what a bad choice until i discovered the truth about grey owl the film does a good job of <UNK> the dignity of these native peoples and <UNK> the racist <UNK> about them and annie <UNK> wow what a beauty and very convincing as an indian woman i believe she is french canadian she sure <UNK> to the all too familiar speech of such in spite of <UNK> detached <UNK> style in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate dedicated man the plot is a little weak in <UNK> his <UNK> from <UNK> to animal <UNK> good film highly recommended
<START> this game is one of the best <UNK> fist it is actually more amusing than any other because of the battle system you harm the enemy depending on how you aim the attack you can <UNK> into <UNK> the special attack the magic the script is very good characters are all lovely and you have no long dialogs to support as happened in several games of final <UNK> series i got bored of that dialogs about past when you just want to go on with the <UNK> story <UNK> is a jewel on this game it combines middle age fantasy with futuristic science fiction it's remarkable that animation effects are just incredible i like them more than other in other modern games we can't remember that legend of the <UNK> is 8 years now then map is huge there are all kinds of places an enemies finally music is not the best game <UNK> i have heard but it's perfect for a game like this
<START> i was expecting a b movie french musical after all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> of low budget french films of that time and it is in color but i have <UNK> in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity musical numbers are awful and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid and the songs what songs this is just a succession of bad numbers one after another the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women it was not familiar at that time in fact some numbers are just there to show us topless women it adds to the mediocrity and try to find young michel <UNK> the future great actor of french cinema in a bit part as a musician in his very first movie good luck
<START> the thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round <UNK> wasn't as good as thumb wars for a number of reasons primarily i think mr <UNK> had far less to work with in the titanic send up unlike star wars the movie titanic hasn't yet become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will <UNK> with the audience br br in <UNK> the holes are filled by one off jokes which don't really seem related to anything for example the hero's <UNK> that the heroine isn't clean during the jump off end of ship scene it's not funny rather you just think to yourself did i miss something in the original movie there were too many of these type of <UNK> jokes <UNK> <UNK> br br by contrast the send up of the smarmy <UNK> designer had meaning and was funny also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go faster as a maniac running around demanding everything be faster including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die these sort of jokes meant something in the titanic context and <UNK> meaningful humour to <UNK> br br the thumb media the faces and the voices are still amusing the props and sets and the cg animation are worthy of appreciation overall although <UNK> proves that <UNK> alone won't work this <UNK> still keeps you amused and <UNK> to the end
<START> blonde and <UNK> has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you're being utterly <UNK> it feels like a late era carry on when the series was no longer blazing <UNK> but was still more funny than not think behind or england and you won't be too far off the mark pamela and denise are <UNK> charming and clearly aware this isn't a masterpiece they're making although you can give me it over lots of things i'm told to like the supporting cast are energetic even if some of them aren't particularly good i can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie that's already practically forgotten making much difference to anything so just smile i really do think blonde and <UNK> is ace and i hope you hate me for it
<START> in a time of magic <UNK> and demons abound a diabolical <UNK> named <UNK> and his mother queen <UNK> who lives in the realm of ice and wants to <UNK> the region of fire ruled by the king <UNK> but when his beautiful daughter princess <UNK> has been kidnapped by <UNK> <UNK> a warrior named <UNK> must protect her and must defeat <UNK> from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an <UNK> named <UNK> br br a nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation <UNK> over them <UNK> it's ralph bakshi's second best movie only with american pop being number one and heavy traffic being third and <UNK> being fourth it's certainly better than his cool world or lord of the rings the artwork is designed by famed artist frank <UNK> and the animation has good <UNK> and there's also a <UNK> for the guys br br i highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2 disc limited edition dvd from blue underground br br also recommended the black <UNK> the dark crystal conan the barbarian the wizard of oz rock rule <UNK> heavy metal <UNK> legend of <UNK> fantastic planet princess <UNK> <UNK> valley of the wind conan the <UNK> <UNK> the princess bride lord of the rings 1978 the sword in the stone <UNK> army of darkness <UNK> <UNK> king arthur the <UNK> return of the king 1980 conquest american pop jason and the <UNK> clash of the <UNK> the last <UNK> the secret of <UNK> the flight of dragons <UNK> disney legend the chronicles of <UNK> harry potter and the <UNK> of fire
<START> dont let the mpaa fool you with their rated r for extreme violence there is <UNK> no extreme violence in this boring <UNK> of s t i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense avoid
<START> quite simply the funniest and <UNK> film comedy of all time it's certainly on my personal top ten list this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale millionaire heir arthur bach moore is a middle aged <UNK> who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite <UNK> he also refuses to leave the bottle one day he and his personal butler <UNK> gielgud go shopping at <UNK> <UNK> and run into petty <UNK> linda minnelli arthur and <UNK> chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film there are hilarious set pieces <UNK> in one such scene arthur drunk throughout most of the story knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering <UNK> from a human <UNK> my husband has a gun performances by everyone involved should be <UNK> noted <UNK> fitzgerald plays <UNK> loving yet ruthless grandmother sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he took home the oscar for this one and christopher cross provides the main theme song oscar winner best that you can do it's a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month march 2002
<START> gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime a bit slow moving especially around the middle of the series but over all enjoyable now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a <UNK> i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam gundam <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> ms team and gundam seed br br i will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be rip offs i e <UNK> <UNK> to the original <UNK> <UNK> but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series as is seed br br if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first and then know that you are watching an <UNK> series
<START> probably one of the most <UNK> slasher movies ever badly acted and badly written br br the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a <UNK> but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy <UNK> john <UNK> played by woody roll or could it be one of the five characters br br acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne <UNK> who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura <UNK> the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end br br the kills can't really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand <UNK> in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive br br overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
<START> i had lost faith in <UNK> r <UNK> after the movie main <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> then a year back now i saw <UNK> for vivah which looked good but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for <UNK> i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie <UNK> r <UNK> it right this time okay i was not a huge fan of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but i have always loved <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to me i think vivah is <UNK> best work i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it my view a much underrated movie br br the story of this movie you might call <UNK> and very old times but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an <UNK> marriage are aware it's an old tradition it's done in present times lots of people don't believe in this <UNK> marriage but i do the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly when <UNK> meets <UNK> for the first time they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way <UNK> and <UNK> meet in this movie is how most <UNK> happen it was a very sweet you feel nervous yet excited the song do <UNK> shows that very well getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between <UNK> and <UNK> shahid kapoor and amrita <UNK> and there families a twist occurs in this movie which is really good the last <UNK> you all will be reaching for the <UNK> box br br what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> how they fall for each other is too sweet simple boy and simple girl when they first meet during and after the song do <UNK> <UNK> it's very sweet to watch she hardly says anything and <UNK> does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have another factor is that <UNK> <UNK> is really mean to her and you feel sorry for <UNK> because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with <UNK> more then just <UNK> when she finds happiness through <UNK> you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl which brings me to performances and amrita <UNK> as <UNK> is amazing in the movie her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness shahid kapoor as <UNK> is amazing too he is <UNK> support in the film he is her happiness the movie together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a <UNK> couple since <UNK> and <UNK> if <UNK> <UNK> didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show scenes which touched me was when <UNK> takes <UNK> to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can <UNK> connect to the film is just the <UNK> thing you will see ever br br the direction is spot on to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera <UNK> them to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop the music is amazing the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for br br what i can finally say it rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person its basically the <UNK> journey ever its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the <UNK> part of your <UNK> this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing
<START> i am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me so i gave this a shot after all it's the great harold lloyd who <UNK> chaplin as a great silent film comedian i have watched much less of <UNK> silent films then of <UNK> but i have to say i'm a much bigger chaplin fan anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn't finish it i can understand why his sound career was so limited he didn't get very good material to work with after you've seen chaplin <UNK> and <UNK> the three stooges martin and lewis the marx brothers and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable i was also interested in watching <UNK> <UNK> as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time 4 out of 10 don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend kelly the second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with <UNK> kelly and in a supporting role charles chase these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel
<START> by the end of the first hour my jaw was <UNK> <UNK> between my feet the movie never and i do mean never lets up in action it may be mild action but it's action once again every member of the cast fits perfectly the explosions were realistic the chase scenes were <UNK> and the fighting was incredible matt damon will forever be jason bourne br br all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception the action the stakes the plot how they do it i will never know i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie we wouldn't have this one to talk about br br so don't go see it in theaters go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live but if not december <UNK> bourne comes home to you
<START> london dreams directed by <UNK> shah is a <UNK> foolish film about foolish people it's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat ajay <UNK> plays <UNK> an aspiring pop <UNK> obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at <UNK> <UNK> stadium he becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band mate <UNK> played by salman khan who is evidently more talented than him but nowhere near as focused or ambitious <UNK> decides to <UNK> <UNK> when the <UNK> popularity threatens to <UNK> his own now here's where a heart to heart might have helped had <UNK> explained what this <UNK> <UNK> meant to him <UNK> would have <UNK> backed off and let <UNK> fulfill his childhood dream and we'd have been <UNK> the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel but director <UNK> shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any <UNK> london dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back story involving <UNK> grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage fright at a packed <UNK> concert or the ridiculous incident at a show where <UNK> must take over vocal <UNK> after a blast of <UNK> practically <UNK> <UNK> into silence the idiocy however doesn't end there in his attempts to shame <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uses his connections to get <UNK> hooked onto drugs a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to down a couple of <UNK> shots with her but <UNK> his salt with cocaine before you know it <UNK> has acquired quite the <UNK> for the <UNK> white <UNK> practically <UNK> it down like dinner if that isn't silly enough there's a crude scene later in which <UNK> chases after the said girl to find out who she's been taking orders from the pursuit ends in a dark london alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the <UNK> so as to <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend who's been secretly following after them wait there's more expect to <UNK> hysterically when <UNK> <UNK> off his belt and <UNK> himself mercilessly to <UNK> all thoughts of romance or lust towards the <UNK> lead dancer <UNK> played by <UNK> because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals too <UNK> inspired by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for it to merit any comparison with last year's rock on <UNK> <UNK> latest is a clunky melodrama that's as loosely directed as it is scripted the film goes for broad humor over the top emotions and basically chooses <UNK> over subtlety that works for <UNK> character with salman khan playing him all <UNK> and lovable but in the case of <UNK> ajay <UNK> comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly <UNK> when <UNK> does reach <UNK> point however it results in an awkward pre climax scene in which he <UNK> a packed concert hall and is understandably <UNK> with plastic <UNK> as punishment of the remaining cast there's not a kind word i can say for <UNK> who practically lit up <UNK> with her <UNK> charm but disappoints here with unnecessary over acting in a <UNK> role <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> roy <UNK> reduced to mere <UNK> in the band show up at regular <UNK> usually to utter some inane dialogue like we'll rock it dude for its dim witted writing and sloppy direction london dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch if you must watch it for salman khan who's turned <UNK> into a <UNK> acting style it's the only thing that'll make you smile in this sad sad film
<START> there are similarities between ray <UNK> <UNK> and his last movie <UNK> ¬ñ a dead body and its <UNK> for already dysfunctional lives but whereas <UNK> offered some hope and resolution <UNK> leaves everything <UNK> in a bleak way that will leave most viewers <UNK> perhaps even cheated br br the storyline the aftermath of a <UNK> discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river is based on a short story by raymond <UNK> it became an element in robert altman's classic 1993 ensemble short cuts lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small australian community under stress the movie poses some moral questions would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend and more <UNK> for <UNK> would it make any difference if the dead person was an <UNK> the acting especially by gabriel <UNK> and laura <UNK> is commendable and there are elements of <UNK> <UNK> by haunting music not unlike <UNK> at hanging rock br br if all this sounds like the basis for a great movie be prepared for a let down the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning thereby <UNK> the element of mystery and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale
<START> i really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie remember folks this is an snl movie not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction the ladies man is a hilarious movie albeit stupid at times with a <UNK> out cast and as usual wonderful performances by will <UNK> and tim meadows yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are unbelievable but its comedy i really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film anyway all i ask is that people take this as it is an snl silly and <UNK> comedy nothing that will win awards but nonetheless some modern comedy gold 10 4 <UNK>
<START> why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago i can say that there is little if anything from the original book i went into this film with low expectations i knew it would have a crappy <UNK> feel to it but it even failed to meet these br br this is not a prequel the only relationship it has with the original is the name this is not the story of carlito <UNK> it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name they have just totally <UNK> in the face of every carlito's way fan out there adding insult to injury by casting luis <UNK> who plays a crucial character in the original movie in a different role br br what's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original <UNK> material of the book carlito's way something i really would have liked to have seen i felt the same way about <UNK> they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of <UNK> most feared underworld figure instead they made a ho hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook though eric <UNK> performance was spot on now we will never get to see carlito's real initial rise and fall br br the three stars is because looking at it purely as a stand alone flick it is not so appalling there are some decent performances jay <UNK> is no carlito but he could be good in other roles and the story is not too bad even <UNK> combs suits his role but they totally <UNK> the nature of the underworld at that time i am a bit of a crime non fiction buff something which the original film and the books got right having been written by then attorney and now judge <UNK> <UNK> br br the fact is though it's not a stand alone it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed
<START> i like billy crystal and i thought it would be fun to watch this film since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together i thought i had seen all <UNK> movies but couldn't remember this one and now i know why it's so full of clich√©s and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going billy doesn't even get to be funny very often he's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down alan king himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la and when the end comes boy does it come quickly almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene mostly disappointing with a few <UNK> of good humor
<START> i got to say that uma thurman is the <UNK> woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most <UNK> <UNK> comedies have but with something a <UNK> extra chemistry uma and luke both have this <UNK> but believable chemistry that seem to <UNK> in each scene both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore anna <UNK> and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even <UNK> <UNK> rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody but i have to say i went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little too well lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film 3 1 2 out of 5
<START> this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who <UNK> a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus <UNK> the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who <UNK> the white characters then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie
<START> i'm fan of art i like anything about art i like paintings <UNK> etc this movie shows it so i like it a lot it shows how a woman wants to paint anything about art especially naked bodies but she can't do it because of her strict family father at the beginning of the movie she painted herself naked but she wanted a man for her paintings but her family didn't let her paint naked men because it's against the moral even so artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked she falls in love with her art teacher and it seems the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too so at the ending he sacrifices his freedom for hers by lying he said that he raped her but it wasn't true artemisia fell in love with him but if she says that she will suffer a lot because in the trial in which artemisia her father and the art teacher were somebody was hurting her artistic hands to say the truth i think this a great movie about art and an artistic love it's worth watching <UNK> <UNK> is great as artemisia she acts very well i also like her performance in the portrait of a lady as <UNK> <UNK> 8 5 10
<START> <UNK> really took the words right out of my mouth i loved <UNK> early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him i just saw this movie ok fell asleep about 90 through so i didn't see the end when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu i was thankful i didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end there was something strange about the voice of segal and others kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed but in the same language <UNK> is english right anyway if i had 10 thumbs they'd all point down right now for this segal injustice
<START> pretty poor <UNK> clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film how disappointing for this to come from hooper and <UNK> br br government <UNK> do a human experiment with a <UNK> bomb the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees and when he's an adult people in his life start <UNK> <UNK> he tries to find out why br br the people completely on fire are well done but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense they're obviously changed to <UNK> when <UNK> of fire shoot out of characters' arms it looks silly rather than <UNK> the way it should also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and <UNK> in huge <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> how is that supposed to happen exactly br br something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies
<START> rating 4 out of 10 br br as this mini series approached and we were well aware of it for the last six months as sci fi channel continued to pepper their shows with <UNK> ads i confess that i felt a growing <UNK> as i learned more br br as with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time different people go to it to see different things in this regard when people think of battlestar galactica they remember different things for some it is the <UNK> warriors with the <UNK> red light in their <UNK> for others it is the <UNK> that they held for special effects that were quite <UNK> for their time many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s especially those on television for some the memories resolve around the story arc others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced br br frankly i come from the latter group the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire yes evil the <UNK> had nothing to gain but the <UNK> of the human race yet they did it while base stars were <UNK> around men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually <UNK> resources and somehow they managed to survive until the next show they didn't survive because they had better technology or more fire power they survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show br br the show had its flaws and at times was sappy but they were people you could care about br br the writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this in some ways he took the least significant part of the original show the character's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a <UNK> of television science fiction since that was their goal they can be judged on how well they accomplished it failure it was far from a <UNK> in fact it was in many ways one of the most <UNK> of science fiction <UNK> in a long time it borrows <UNK> from st <UNK> st <UNK> <UNK> 5 and even battlefield earth i find that unfortunate br br ronald d moore has been a <UNK> to popular science fiction for more than a decade and has made contribution to some of the most popular television science fiction that you could hope to see one of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the enterprise d e that was the <UNK> rule of <UNK> st <UNK> like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority ron moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master gene <UNK> here instead of writing the best story possible he has created a <UNK> cast as i have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could besides being dysfunctional some of it was not the least bit believable anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone <UNK> striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days in hack they could have gotten execution and they never would have gotten out the next day it wouldn't have happened period especially in time of war br br the thing that i remembered most of ron moore's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of capt james kirk he killed capt kirk and alas for me he has killed battlestar galactica
<START> i hope the viewer who regards <UNK> <UNK> as one of corey <UNK> finest and the best movies of the century was kidding <UNK> sarcasm on my part i sincerely hope so br br 'the dream <UNK> marks the first of a long line of mediocre <UNK> that would plague the rest of corey <UNK> career except <UNK> of the <UNK> which was surprisingly decent here <UNK> plays <UNK> college boy <UNK> who <UNK> that a cool car will attract his dream girl's attention lucky for <UNK> a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband <UNK> decides to reward her faithful piano <UNK> <UNK> with a gift a slick <UNK> <UNK> however <UNK> to the woman and unfortunate for <UNK> is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the <UNK> now being that in this movie bodies don't seem to <UNK> or possess a rather foul <UNK> <UNK> is unaware of this in fact the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is <UNK> despite several odd circumstances that <UNK> in particular a <UNK> man follows him around desperate to get hold of that body relatively <UNK> br br this is a low grade action <UNK> as many of <UNK> films like this are see the double o kid despite being part action part romantic comedy this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem i e <UNK> being in possession of a car and a dead body and a hit man finding out that the <UNK> is going to be hard to find after which and thanks to poor acting by <UNK> i loved this kid too but it's not exactly <UNK> to admit the times when he obviously couldn't act well and the lack of real <UNK> and <UNK> between <UNK> and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result <UNK> to add injury to insult the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self evident songs you would hear in team america see the <UNK> montage br br loyal corey <UNK> fans however should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance however others understanding that <UNK> career probably <UNK> when he was 14 or 15 and never <UNK> might expect mediocrity as will viewers just looking for early 90s b comedy fluff to pass the time
<START> this is the single worst movie i have ever seen let me say that again this is the single worst movie i have ever seen br br it had all of the ear marks of a bad movie continuity errors bad writing bad acting bad production value bad music i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you this movie gets and f in this category the second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them we are supposed to care this movie gets an f in this regard as well br br the first story a woman gets <UNK> by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her the next story an <UNK> guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his oh and then there is the horrific nail biting story of a bad roommate come on could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house being <UNK> <UNK> and having a roommate turns out all of these stories where hallucinations virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself wow stupid br br let me explain something i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are i couldn't do that with this one it was utter pain to sit and watch do not under any <UNK> watch this movie you will regret it
<START> this film came recommended as a good action film which i don't really think it is i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow there really isn't that much action until the end of the film and it's pretty dark and hard to see what's really happening i was sure hoping for something different but alas didn't find it here
<START> this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few <UNK> theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are <UNK> without proper start and and with a <UNK> content and full of <UNK> he has nothing to say about the subject so he over <UNK> with violence <UNK> and <UNK> language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him <UNK> in piece
<START> i'm always <UNK> on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes people who think it's the best movie and people who think it's the worst br br <UNK> wouldn't be the worst movie i've ever seen but it's up there first of all the sound the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when <UNK> was talking in her <UNK> voice she could hardly be heard br br i usually like <UNK> and <UNK> but they were both flat in this movie <UNK> had basically 3 emotions quiet in great pain or really angry she has <UNK> the first was the <UNK> one the second involved screaming pain the third involving raising her voice it was <UNK> that <UNK> the three and not emotion br br maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style when you watch a 3 minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story in a 2 hour feature film it's nauseating i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the <UNK> and dropping a child and no <UNK> does not rain that often br br i think maybe a real story with something to say could have been intended but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that <UNK> apartment that ms <UNK> lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story
<START> possible spoilers br br i recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences ron <UNK> is just right as doc cool calm almost always in control and with an occasional <UNK> in his eye what more can one ask for i have never read a doc savage book so i don't know if it is faithful to the source but i enjoyed the light tone and <UNK> do many people have compared this movie to <UNK> of the lost <UNK> which i don't think is fair the difference in budget is astounding <UNK> must have at least 10 times the budget doc savage does not have the extensive location work that <UNK> has special effects are also at a minimum but come on people the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right the <UNK> music is catchy love that theme song every time i watch the film i end up <UNK> the theme for days the best way to approach this film is to just relax and enjoy highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and doc chase the indian sniper throughout the <UNK> of new york and the very funny fight sequence between doc and captain <UNK> not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant <UNK> really overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day i give it 7 out of 10 br br doc savage doc savage thank the lord he's here
<START> the dentist starts on the morning of dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen his wife <UNK> linda hoffman wedding <UNK> on the surface mr mrs feinstone seem to have a nice life a beautiful home in los angeles he has a successful career with responsibility but beneath things are very wrong alan discovers that brooke is having an affair with matt michael <UNK> the swimming pool <UNK> to add to his <UNK> alan then discovers that matt is also having sex with paula roberts <UNK> <UNK> one of his next door <UNK> to top it all off he owes the irs who are breathing down his neck a shed load of money alan starts to lose his mind he convinces himself that everything is <UNK> rotten just like his <UNK> teeth it's up to him to fix it that morning at work he begins to take his <UNK> anger out on his patients first he <UNK> a young boy named <UNK> brian <UNK> he sexual <UNK> a patient named april reign <UNK> <UNK> after he <UNK> that she is his wife deliberately performs an unnecessary painful <UNK> on another alan also begins to take drugs as he completely loses it goes homicidal starting with his <UNK> wife pool <UNK> br br directed by brian <UNK> i thought the dentist was a good film tried something a bit different the script by dennis <UNK> stuart gordon charles <UNK> is more of a psycho thriller than straight slasher which came as a surprise to me as i was expecting the latter it would have been easy to make a teenage slasher film like friday the 13th 1980 with a high body count a wise cracking dentist villain but what the dentist actually turned out to be is very different the dentist is at heart a character study of one mans descent into madness it does a fine job although having said that i'm not sure what he goes through is enough justification for his subsequent murderous actions it moves along at a nice pace has a nice narrative in which i liked the constant connection alan makes between the <UNK> he sees in his patients the <UNK> he sees in the world around him is an entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes it goes without saying that anyone with a <UNK> about the dentist probably should give this one a miss or you'll never go again i liked the ending too where the tables are turned i'll say no more br br director <UNK> does his usual fine job here in fact i don't think i've seen a <UNK> film that i didn't enjoy to some extent he obviously predictably takes the opportunity to play on our fear of the dentist with some nice dental torture set pieces including pulling people's teeth out sexually <UNK> them performing <UNK> on drugs torturing people with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there are some other gore scenes as well a dead dog someone <UNK> <UNK> with a knife cut out <UNK> <UNK> gives the film a certain style on what was probably a low budget he likes to <UNK> his camera which make for some nice angles i liked the shot where the camera is above someone being <UNK> huge <UNK> of blood splatter on the floor in a nice wide <UNK> angle br br technically the dentist is fine decent cinematography music production values although some of the special make up effects look a little unconvincing the acting is pretty strong from everyone involved with corbin putting in a good <UNK> performance the ever cool genre favourite ken <UNK> turns up as detective <UNK> one of los angeles finest br br the dentist didn't turn out like i had expected all the better for it if your a horror fan perhaps want something a bit different then this is well worth checking out i liked it think it's definitely worth a watch
<START> another weak third season entry <UNK> there in truth no beauty ' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say fascinating the main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane it's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise obviously i think it was a mistake to ever <UNK> the alien as its actual <UNK> in no way even <UNK> such a <UNK> build up all we get is the standard star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes usually when the ship is passing through a <UNK> storm or something similar in any event <UNK> appearance can at least be <UNK> by mr spock and then only if spock is wearing a special <UNK> for the longest time i thought the <UNK> name was <UNK> ' which i found humorous but i <UNK> spock is required to mind <UNK> with <UNK> at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety this is accomplished but when spock <UNK> go back to end the mind <UNK> by <UNK> spock forgets his <UNK> uh oh he goes crazy but eventually <UNK> with the help of <UNK> assistant a blind woman with psychic powers this might have been a really bizarre excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the <UNK> last season
<START> i saw his movie in dallas texas when it came out in 1986 i remember them giving out <UNK> for showing up to see the movie after seeing the movie i can see why the movie was not bad nor was it great the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story they created a new story new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of <UNK> masters attacking the earth they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue as a kid i loved the movie but unfortunately i haven't seen it as an adult and can't give a better review looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re <UNK> my stance on it that being said will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge i love <UNK> and can't wait for the shadows chronicles
<START> having not seen all the films released in 2002 i can't say that this is the best film of the year i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year br br most american films featuring black people either <UNK> over the american <UNK> with race relations or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto with every <UNK> imaginable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard race is irrelevant save for one fight that may or may not have been <UNK> by a racial <UNK> br br antwone <UNK> story is one that should find <UNK> with any <UNK> individual he is <UNK> and <UNK> portrayed by derek luke denzel washington while obviously using his star power to have the film made sticks to the background for the most part and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story br br at a time when bet and popular culture in general want to maintain the <UNK> of a large number of americans and <UNK> too you know this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us i just hope that the non black audience will go see this film for that humanity rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with that would be a sad commentary on race relations in north america in and of itself br br
<START> i thank god i didn't go to cinema for this film i would be very sorry for the money i gave i saw it on tv and i couldn't <UNK> my eyes i wonder if any film could be worse than this one they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing awful acting and awful scenario i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company it's very big fiasco in year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of film <UNK>
<START> visitor q is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world's most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from <UNK> to murder to incest to <UNK> to <UNK> to a <UNK> mom who <UNK> her husband and adult daughter etc the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following however with home video quality and a <UNK> production visitor q just doesn't hold up even as a curiosity <UNK> are <UNK> out and <UNK> <UNK> clearly visible make up is awful and everything else is amateurish at best a waste of time c
<START> i loved this movie it was so well done great acting and drama and historically accurate i love <UNK> schneider movies this one rocks not as great as <UNK> but still rocks br br and <UNK> she commented and said french dubbing well this is originally a german movie not french so <UNK> second of all there was a plot maybe your not familiar with history oh and her mother played the part of her <UNK> not her teacher and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria maybe u missed that detail br br but anyway <UNK> the history in this movie is great i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating i love all the historical stuff like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the new type of dance <UNK> when <UNK> was new it was considered kinda <UNK> because the couples dance so close <UNK> her <UNK> was like oh my god br br and also the clothes i love the clothes the styles are great <UNK> <UNK> are awesome and of course <UNK> always looks very pretty
<START> casting jack cassidy as ken <UNK> was sheer brilliance cassidy <UNK> arrogance confidence charm and wit all with a condescending evil little <UNK> on his face in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer having appeared three times in the columbo series this particular and first performance is my favorite columbo episode ever hands down a fresh faced steven spielberg did amazing camera work yes there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between columbo and franklin also the <UNK> and tight in shots at big bear lake <UNK> <UNK> cabin home were very impressive br br if you have not yet seen this episode then you owe it to yourself to do so it's a true masterpiece br br jack cassidy was a very talented actor and singer his charismatic personality was highly <UNK> his death in 1976 at age <UNK> was very sad and indeed very tragic he surely had his best years ahead of him rest in peace jack you will live on for eternity through your great work
<START> olivier <UNK> richardson <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> have all directed hamlet but branagh's the only one who got it right br br this is the only film of hamlet that contains the full four hours of william shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story br br not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but branagh's <UNK> use of <UNK> film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out br br examples of this include <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as <UNK> asks him to spy on <UNK> this also included billy crystal as the grave <UNK> robin williams as <UNK> jack lemmon as <UNK> and charlton heston as the actor br br branagh's performance of the act 4 scene 4 <UNK> which again is usually cut out is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows it is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start <UNK> br br branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience br br this is a must see for everyone who <UNK> good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction all of these part of william <UNK> greatest triumph
<START> set in the <UNK> in west africa in the 1950s claire <UNK> <UNK> is a beautifully photographed and emotionally <UNK> tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying <UNK> on a young family during the last years of french rule the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country france <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a young woman traveling through <UNK> recalls her childhood when her father <UNK> <UNK> was a government official in the french <UNK> and she had a loving friendship with the brooding <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> the heart of the film however revolves around <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and her love hate relationship with <UNK> that is <UNK> with <UNK> sexual tension br br the household is divided into public and private spaces the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except <UNK> who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower <UNK> exposing their naked <UNK> bodies to the white family's <UNK> it becomes clear when her husband marc <UNK> <UNK> goes away on business that <UNK> and <UNK> are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged in one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other's image in the mirror with a <UNK> longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo br br the young france <UNK> <UNK> also forms a bond with the <UNK> feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the <UNK> sky in spite of their bond the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when france <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when <UNK> stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command when a plane loses its <UNK> and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located each visitor shows their disdain for the <UNK> one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings <UNK> food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room another luc jean claude <UNK> an arrogant white frenchman <UNK> the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and <UNK> <UNK> about her attraction to <UNK> leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the <UNK> br br <UNK> is loosely <UNK> adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed denis makes her point about the effects of <UNK> without preaching or <UNK> the characters there are no victims or <UNK> no simplistic good guys <UNK> is a servant but he is also a <UNK> as when he stands guard over the bed where <UNK> and her daughter sleep to protect them from a <UNK> <UNK> it is a sad fact that <UNK> is treated as a boy and not as a man but <UNK> <UNK> his character with such dignity and stature that it <UNK> the pain because of its pace western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not in roger <UNK> phrase coach our emotions the truth of <UNK> lies in the gestures and <UNK> that touch the silent longing of our heart
<START> this movie is terrible but it has some good effects
<START> a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer <UNK> <UNK> magnificent performance from stephen rea as the <UNK> scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest <UNK> to his progress is the russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society br br the film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in russia which is subtly put across there is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two <UNK> of <UNK> superior played by donald sutherland and rea himself these are at first <UNK> with sutherland <UNK> in system looking down and rea <UNK> on the ground looking up however they have a common cause ¬ñ to catch the serial killer br br throughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually <UNK> until at the end of the movie rea and sutherland and rea and sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and <UNK> <UNK> comes excellent script br br further credits go to <UNK> performance which is superb and sympathetic jeffrey <UNK> as the killer whom we despise but can't hate and max von <UNK> who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help
<START> boy what a dud this mess was but it only lasts an hour and i only paid a buck for it so i'll live unlike the entire cast of this 1933 <UNK> who are all dust by now br br so anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been <UNK> of all their blood the local <UNK> start talking about vampires of course and a little more <UNK> after each body is found the town sheriff or <UNK> or whatever he is played by awesome actor melvyn douglas tries to tell them otherwise when he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck instead of two holes close together the locals simply then say it's a giant vampire bat the <UNK> insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human <UNK> doing the killings br br but melvyn doesn't seem too bothered either way he spends most of his time trying to get into the <UNK> of his <UNK> played by faye <UNK> also in this mix is the town <UNK> played by dwight frye who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did he further freaks out the <UNK> by catching bats and drinking his own blood lionel <UNK> plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the <UNK> solve the crimes and boy does he ever stink as an actor <UNK> is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get and lionel barrymore is also in this thing lots of big names to be such a pile of <UNK> br br other than the terrible <UNK> title this movie has the alternate name the blood sucker is much better this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly br br for me the high point of the movie is watching frye he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn't offer much and then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you'll really be let down br br bela lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch think of this movie as a really bad lugosi <UNK> without lugosi and you'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was br br if you can't make a good 1930's horror film at least put lugosi in it
<START> this is another of the many b minus movies <UNK> as film noir in the hope of <UNK> some interest in something that is devoid of it all aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre the acting by the three leads is wooden i guess john <UNK> was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work lee j <UNK> who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction jane <UNK> is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen the one in which john <UNK> goes after lee j <UNK> is particularly strange the dvd transfer is typical <UNK>
<START> includes spoilers br br i've been a horror film fan now for many decades just when i think i've seen all the great ones another pops up to surprise me i had never seen this film before it was a treat off the beaten path too not just the path to the swamp ferry boat either here was a horror film made in the 1940s that <UNK> to try something very different the pretty girl is <UNK> <UNK> for a change and saves the men including the man she loves from the monster how is that for a twist this girl was the complete opposite of most women in films of that time no screaming at her own shadow no <UNK> from fright no <UNK> over a <UNK> as she runs this gal wasn't afraid to live alone in a secluded <UNK> far away from the rest of the villagers not only that but the place was on a <UNK> swamp <UNK> to be haunted heck she even takes <UNK> on the swamp grass <UNK> like a regular 1940s version of <UNK> no snake <UNK> or ghostly <UNK> would dare bother this gal books on early feminist films should be sure to include this overlooked work br br see this if you are a fan like me of those wonderfully atmospheric classic b w horror films they made only in the 30s and 40s and be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection
<START> br br however the ladies of all ages will lap it up no doubt at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother and most of us men try to <UNK> out what it is to be a father whether changing <UNK> is not at all my favourite <UNK> and trying to get those <UNK> baby <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother has absolutely nothing to do with the matter br br some good interpretations here and a good story idea the handling of the matter limited to rather <UNK> tv production concepts gives the film a rather over <UNK> taste with not much new to offer an insipid way of delivering the goods and in the end the outcome is so <UNK> during the last 20 minutes or so even my wife <UNK> off and i was jumping up to the computer to get the on line <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> match hoping the away team would do something rather good they did this film did not br br better by far is mike <UNK> magnificent secrets and lies <UNK> which touches on the same subject matter but with brenda <UNK> playing a far superior part
<START> by the numbers story of the kid prince a singer on his way to becoming a star then he falls in love with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but he has to deal with his wife beating father clarence williams iii and his own self destructive behavior br br i saw this in a theatre in 1984 i was no big fan of prince but i did like the three big songs from this movie purple rain let's get crazy and when <UNK> cry the concert scenes in this movie are great full of energy and excitement unfortunately that's a very small portion of the movie br br the story is <UNK> obvious and have been done many times before and much better too the subplots are to put in nicely badly handled the love triangle between the kid <UNK> and morris day was so predictable and tired that i actually became insulted his wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled in acting and direction that i couldn't believe it the script is terrible lousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines and there's tons of <UNK> here the kid's mother getting beaten the kid hitting <UNK> and for no reason <UNK> <UNK> and goes topless to swim in a dirty river also <UNK> and <UNK> characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly br br the acting is where this movie really fails <UNK> is sweet and beautiful but no actor and prince is easily the worst actor i've ever seen his blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad i couldn't believe it this movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many the dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through they should have just made this a concert film i give this a 2 only for the music
<START> this is an important film it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention there's a lot to like here the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions unlike a lot of recent american cinema this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place the dvd includes a lot of bonus features and there are two <UNK> that explain the movie for the viewers still <UNK> after an initial viewing when the film screened at sundance it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry this is a sunday morning coffee movie not a friday night party movie for the dedicated viewer it's a treasure <UNK>
<START> king kong vs godzilla 1963 which i recall having rated bomb had been my introduction to cult director <UNK> work this one isn't necessarily better ¬ñ it's just that i've learned to be more <UNK> towards such <UNK> <UNK> fare br br here we actually get two <UNK> for the price of one an ugly and dopey looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse the <UNK> creature lives on the island of <UNK> ¬ñ where it's shown fighting a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans naturally it falls for the blonde and bland heroine in fact more intriguing is a femme fatale in <UNK> with the film's villainous mad genius ¬ñ called dr who and sporting the <UNK> look and cape usually associated with a vampire br br he kidnaps king kong and <UNK> it in order to retrieve the element x which is <UNK> in the icy wastes of the north pole apparently the giant ape is more <UNK> to radiation than its mechanical counterpart and to ensure its full co operation who even captures its three <UNK> the female agent then has a change of heart helps the heroes one of whom typically is a <UNK> american and is killed by who kong eventually escapes and makes it to tokyo where it has a final showdown with the robot the doctor <UNK> the ensuing mayhem in his sub ¬ñ which on a request by <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> by the giant ape
<START> if you like cars you will love this film br br there are some superb actors in the film especially <UNK> jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and <UNK> appearance the others are not bad either br br there are only two slight flaws to this film firstly the poor plot however people don't watch this film for the plot secondly the <UNK> of grand <UNK> auto car crime however if people really believe they can steal a <UNK> and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail br br when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role i first thought <UNK> but then i thought <UNK> you suck but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he <UNK> only joking he plays the role very well br br i'll end this unusual review by saying if the <UNK> demise of a criminal has in some way <UNK> the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy <UNK> of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent <UNK> and a supreme glory we should all be so fortunate you can say poor criminal i say poor us br br p s angelina jolie voight looks quite nice
<START> no movies have grabbed my attention like this one has you see i have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty five years the one and only time i saw it was as a teen <UNK> which may have been the year it was released 1977 br br what i do remember of the movie is that it touched those deep held emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again the intrigue this movie provides by the human element of father son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it why this movie has not been brought out of <UNK> and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth i do not know br br <UNK> received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true rating reflects movie content would like to watch this movie on dvd as seeing this 1977 production on a used vhs tape took away from the overall quality
<START> hmm imdb rating of 7 5 good comments <UNK> <UNK> okay two of my friends and me we <UNK> pizza sat down and wanted to see something as cool as <UNK> or at least something brainless but funny like versus but naked blood sucked it's a complete waste okay the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding but that's it nothing more nothing less i won't <UNK> the plot other people did already i just wanted to stop the hype but watch it and rate for yourself maybe we can push the rating where it <UNK> be one more thing that comes to my mind the soundtrack is even worse than carpenter ever was okay john's cool 2 10
<START> ah domino is actually a breath of fresh air something new to the cinema world i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot the varied characters and the intense camera effects i've seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the <UNK> of mistakes made through time all of what you see was the desired effect perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before although that's what sets it apart in a deeper aspect what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes think about it br br when it comes to the story i don't see anything quite bad about it despite it's messy nature according to some it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling the plot really isn't all that hard to follow if you actually focus on what's going on maybe it's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting the plot etc i'm no <UNK> or anything who picks movies apart it just comes to me with that said i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed despite it's future as a cult classic blockbuster or whatever br br and the characters well there's no <UNK> how varied the cast is i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively that's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives setting them apart even further basically i personally loved the cast and characters br br all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just don't see it as i do or it just doesn't appeal to them no matter this is a great film in it's own right no it's a great film period
<START> another <UNK> masterpiece br br this is a best <UNK> film i'm ever seen woo <UNK> forever except some hollywood moments john woo greater director of the century br br maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free mind people br br his movies like the great poetry woo is a movie <UNK> woo is a movie <UNK> woo is a <UNK> of <UNK> br br imho violent in woo films is not a directors <UNK> but a <UNK> of art themes of woo movies is more <UNK> that more of the new films
<START> fully deserving its <UNK> hollywood award nomination this is an entertaining little gem with lots of <UNK> and some delightful surprises <UNK> funny scenes include an hilarious shoot and re shoot of a <UNK> <UNK> scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non com and the hapless <UNK> as a boyer colman <UNK> ¬ó all under the <UNK> eye of ralph <UNK> delightfully <UNK> anguish a lost <UNK> guided and re guided by equally <UNK> jack carson assistant director chandler <UNK> in a <UNK> sent opportunity i'm going to be a director br br ace comic <UNK> has a <UNK> role playing both <UNK> and himself playing <UNK> oddly richard l bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series has turned down that opportunity here in real life <UNK> a <UNK> six foot rock hudson <UNK> but here he's <UNK> by veteran actor over 500 movies jack <UNK>
<START> i saw this film by chance on the small box it has a fantastic and chilling scene about <UNK> gas a lot about <UNK> <UNK> a bit of <UNK> i can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes
<START> someone needed to make a car <UNK> this is truly awful makes jean <UNK> cyborg look like gone with the wind this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back luckily it produced severe <UNK> from which i fell asleep how can actors of this caliber create this dog i would rather spend the time watching <UNK> grow on the side of a fish tank than <UNK> of this wholly awful <UNK> of several genre i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table 5 99 at <UNK> is far too much to spend on this movie if you really have to have it wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the <UNK> for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell br br please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity
<START> i spent eight years running movie theatres in the 80's and 90's this was by far the worst film i ever showed to the public one thing that made it so bad was that it put on <UNK> of trying to be a great inspiring film even the great gregory peck could not save this horrid piece of drivel from being far less than mediocre jamie lee curtis in an early non horror film role demonstrated clearly that she had not yet learned to act she's still trying but it isn't getting much better br br i'm sorry and here's the spoiler international nuclear <UNK> is never going to happen just because it makes children afraid to play little league baseball even the shows on nick and the disney channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe that dreck br br this is not worth the time you would waste watching it on cable tv it is not worth the price of a movie rental your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of <UNK> popcorn to go with the other movie you picked because it can only be better than this
<START> true there are many movies much worse then this movie this movie was no <UNK> the hands of fate or <UNK> 2 yes i have seen them both twice but at the same time this movie is no alien predator or even alien vs predator yes even that movie <UNK> this movies like this make battlefield earth look like a star wars it is so bad <UNK> awards <UNK> your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters this film i'm talking about is of course alone in the dark i'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad br br acting i'll first start off with what perhaps was the best <UNK> of this film next to the ending credits which played <UNK> i had an <UNK> the acting christian slater must be proud of himself he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking <UNK> though all his awful dialog he had to speak it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway perhaps it was because of stephen <UNK> being in the film as well somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it tara reid is a bad actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these that is not to say the acting was perfect though it was average not good and perhaps the only thing in the film not good br br the soundtrack except for <UNK> i had an <UNK> the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy <UNK> being <UNK> into the viewers ears perhaps to disguise the awful story something i will get to soon a long and very expensive 2 cd soundtrack is now up for sale for those <UNK> challenged br br the directing directed by <UNK> favorite director uwe ball who brought us the classic house of the dead telling us yes movies can get this utterly bad and that's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies at least it is said to be directed by uwe ball without being told i would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the <UNK> brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked the director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a <UNK> and pushed forward until it hits a wall on the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action the camera stops for some reason br br the producing who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb i pity the fool sometimes sometimes i'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag br br the writing <UNK> trying to <UNK> the story is more painful then <UNK> an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as i possibly could with it right after but i will still attempt it br br edward <UNK> escapes as a child from an <UNK> where 20 children where to go under science experiments he escapes and hides in an <UNK> <UNK> where he is <UNK> this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud then it fast <UNK> many years later where he's a paranoia detective he <UNK> attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death kills it and moves on with life later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows br br yeah the plot is bad really really bad the film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes which felt like 100 of random text about an untrue civilization called the <UNK> the film goes not to have one twist after another more then the audience can handle more then the audience wants to handle more then the audience could ever care about this storyline is rock bottom bad that even double dragon does better br br overall miss out on this movie i gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0
<START> i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes but 20 minutes in i was <UNK> <UNK> the fast forward button far too many shots of stewart michael <UNK> walking from room to room down <UNK> through doors and down the street and as many shots of him looking <UNK> and confused gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short 20 30 minutes and then stretched into a feature as a <UNK> of love between director <UNK> and star <UNK> they co wrote the screenplay br br it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before or if the ending wasn't <UNK> the one i had predicted three minutes into the film <UNK> for an independent smaller studio film at least its heart was in the right place it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense
<START> you have to see it to believe it directors <UNK> <UNK> and mark <UNK> have done a thing really great it is a 10 out of 10 so i can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie with people love scenes and so on i am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet finally it has nothing to do with al <UNK> documentary movie an <UNK> truth mainly made of long monologues painfully and with truths not always accurate as many scientists have pointed already br br the best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth
<START> this movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good i am a big fan toni collette i think she is a very beautiful and talented actress the movie starts off about robin williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid the book is great and he <UNK> believe a kid wrote it toni collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up i am not gonna ruin the movie but i will say this the movie is not scary br br the acting is pretty good and toni <UNK> performance was awesome as well as robin williams br br the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i would wait for it to come to dvd
<START> some might <UNK> but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films this misses out on all <UNK> br br a bunch of young people women with <UNK> breasts and continuously wet t shirts naturally go to film blood surfing and end up running into a <UNK> foot crocodile br br not only was the croc obviously fake but some of the props notice the boat hitting the <UNK> in particular look like they've come out of thunderbirds br br no good from start to finish don't see it
<START> the oddly named vera ellen was to movie dancing what <UNK> <UNK> was to movie ice <UNK> blonde <UNK> always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually <UNK> with weak material when i watch vera <UNK> sexy <UNK> dance with gene kelly in <UNK> and <UNK> i can't help <UNK> that her <UNK> yellow with narrow red <UNK> <UNK> seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american vera ellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in <UNK> a city not noted for its tap dancers <UNK> be <UNK> and <UNK> go <UNK> br br in the latter <UNK> romero plays an american <UNK> who for some reason is staging a musical in <UNK> there's a vague attempt to link this show to the <UNK> festival which is nonsense the festival is not a showcase for <UNK> leg shows we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from a few <UNK> accents there's absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romero's show is <UNK> to <UNK> this is a <UNK> pun that <UNK> will get and <UNK> won't br br vera ellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot mistaken identity between <UNK> david niven and reporter gordon jackson is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isn't required to convince us that he's interested in <UNK> the heroine br br the single biggest <UNK> of this movie is its <UNK> of bobby <UNK> the father of sally ann <UNK> was a major star of west end stage musicals his <UNK> rendition of she's my lovely was a big hit in britain in <UNK> here he shows up in several scenes as romero's <UNK> but never has a chance to participate in a musical number nor even any real comedy it's absolutely criminal that this movie with a title containing the word <UNK> sure to evoke <UNK> greatest hit would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do br br the delightful character actress <UNK> <UNK> whom i worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and there's a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay <UNK> as vera <UNK> <UNK> somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i've ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> both at the same go but doesn't match either val guest has a story credit but this movie doesn't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though i realise that <UNK> britain could not afford hollywood's process work <UNK> go <UNK> is at <UNK> best a pleasant time <UNK> with <UNK> being the <UNK> word i'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10
<START> this movie is simply far too long far too repetitive with the male nudity and sexuality being as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles far too gratuitous and unnecessary much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience and <UNK> of an audience br br i saw this movie on an early saturday afternoon with a film festival audience the type of crowd that tends to be more <UNK> interested in more experimental or <UNK> films such as one without much dialog shorts foreign films the near sell out crowd in an <UNK> <UNK> seat theater started to <UNK> out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the pay off which never actually arrived i have never in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals experimental gay and otherwise seen such a large number of people walk away from a film br br this movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was it also could have gone in different directions still with a shorter running time and been far more effective br br as it currently exists this is not something that one can readily recommend or one i would have any desire to watch again
<START> the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me because alan <UNK> was a friend of mine i got to hear about it i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor i asked peter <UNK> through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it i was told too late so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay then i was invited to see the finished film i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on it's a beautifully made piece from a <UNK> written first draft i expected to be asked to do much more work on it perhaps if i had it wouldn't be so good i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is i would also love to see the film again i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in <UNK>
<START> probably the worst film i've ever seen the acting and story were terrible and i almost fell asleep the only good actor was <UNK> <UNK> i had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing
<START> scott henderson alan curtis is <UNK> accused of killing his <UNK> wife the night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone he's sentenced to die and his secretary ella raines sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him br br this was made as a b film from universal look at the cast all character actors and one star <UNK> tone on the decline the budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film <UNK> of the 1940s it's beautifully directed by <UNK> <UNK> and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by william irish a pen name for <UNK> <UNK> it moves quickly and just looks fantastic and there's the infamous jam session with raines and elisha cook jr which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy i'm surprised the censors didn't cut it br br there are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect tone gives a dreadful performance he looks ghastly and he's just horrible also curtis is stiff and bland as henderson you really wonder why raines loves him he's so <UNK> but raines is pretty good in the lead role she's pretty and full of life also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true he's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem <UNK> br br still i'm giving this a 9 a really great film flaws aside
<START> as a wwii naval history buff and someone who is not proud of this country's history of race relations i was looking forward to seeing this movie what a disappointing piece of schlock i made it about 3 4 of the way through but i should have turned it off at the sub attack scene the idea that a u boat would fire a <UNK> at a <UNK> as if there was a hope of hitting it and then be able to run away from the <UNK> while <UNK> is preposterous and that's just a small detail the whole movie was poorly written poorly directed and poorly acted i agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie it's as if they decided that since all those crappy wwii propaganda films were made with all white casts they needed to make one with black people and as bad as those old movies were this is actually worse and it almost <UNK> of false advertising to <UNK> <UNK> davis and stephen rea it turns out they had very minor roles i have to believe those two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film i'm done i've given way too much of my life this crap movie
<START> it is not every film's job to <UNK> you <UNK> i will take an ambitious failure over a mass market hit any day while this really can't be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that <UNK> quality <UNK> me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its <UNK> plot seems to be <UNK> up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the long <UNK> climax of <UNK> awakening comes about 20 minutes late br br great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the <UNK> <UNK> is provocative and engaging a character is rear projected but his own hand in the <UNK> isn't the world depicted is deliberate <UNK> and absurd keep your eyes <UNK> for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop br br the compositions are stunning <UNK> chose to release the out of print <UNK> in the pan <UNK> format must have never seen it where is the dvd br br it is <UNK> how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being <UNK> for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock's foreign <UNK> in which <UNK> europeans also manipulate an american <UNK> and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the <UNK> amidst <UNK> societies after <UNK> von trier moved away from this type of <UNK> technical experiment towards dreary over rated un nuanced <UNK> like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
<START> a detective dana andrews with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder craig stevens and then tries to cover it up the otto preminger directed film has plenty of atmosphere but the story gets watered down when the dead man's wife gene tierney falls for andrews he was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film gary <UNK> is great as <UNK> a crime boss that andrews is obsessed with bringing down and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive especially a scene in a bath house with <UNK> andrews and <UNK> brand and the night time <UNK> outside of <UNK> hospital that sets up what ought to have been the film's conclusion high marks for atmosphere andrews <UNK> etc and the general portrayal of the underworld though the love angle and the simplistic good cop bad cop elements don't help its cause
<START> i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film br br stardust follows <UNK> a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall a <UNK> between england and a magical kingdom known as <UNK> br br this film was just a joy to watch it has something in it for everyone all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride a classic br br all the performances are outstanding the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of <UNK> the <UNK> naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as <UNK> but the performance to talk about is robert de niro in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show br br if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film nothing about the film seems forced
<START> action adventure <UNK> clark is twenty years old very pretty and without a care in the world until a brutal street gang <UNK> her life and she turns into an alley cat bent on revenge when the gang attacks her grandparents house and her car <UNK> uses her black belt <UNK> to fight them off but at the same time she earns their hatred and she and her grandparents are marked for <UNK> when her grandparents lose their lives to the brutal thugs <UNK> becomes like a cat stalking her prey and no prison police force boyfriend or crooked judge can get in the way of her <UNK> <UNK> she's a one woman vigilante squad a martial arts queen a crack shot with no mercy she's the alley cat watch for the dramatic ending versus the gang leader rated r for nudity violence other films with <UNK> <UNK> actress filmography <UNK> angel 1985 <UNK> soon lee from here to eternity 1979 mini tv series <UNK> filmography as actress stunts filmography <UNK> angel 1985 stunts p s she should have been <UNK> in the batman movie br br
<START> this film is terrible i was really looking forward to it as i thought <UNK> was great br br the following review may contain spoilers br br br br first the good things it looks great some of the performances are ok the bad things are everything else about it br br the story as you possibly know is about some <UNK> who go fishing and discover a body with the twist that they find it on friday but continue fishing and finally report it on sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range however the film takes it's time boy does it take its time getting to this central event br br of the ensemble of characters about a dozen not one seems to like another one which is i suppose consistent because they are all unlikable i was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related and it was not until near the end of the movie that i could vaguely <UNK> the family tree br br it's hard to think of a film us <UNK> grim which is a failure in the structure of the story as the character's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after once you've set the bar so high it's hard to up it short of everyone committing suicide br br there are silly <UNK> in logic the killer <UNK> the body in the lake and then it somehow <UNK> miles <UNK> into the mountains the <UNK> walk out sunday morning but for some reason <UNK> gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station um they haven't heard of the <UNK> down at the station the media know the whole story less than 24 hours after they reported the body br br totally missing from the story is the debate the <UNK> surely had after they find the body this is a mystery everyone asks them how could you do that and the audience is asking the same question the debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in deliverance i know exactly what i'd do in their situation someone needs to walk out to the car drive to mobile range call the cops wait and them guide them back to the location if the others wait at camp and fish who cares br br a lot of all this just seems false the only thing that <UNK> true was that as the girl was black the local <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> actions as racist wouldn't have done it if it was a white girl br br throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl i think the subject is mentioned once and there is no mystery as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene br br so i'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused when there's a twist not in the plot but the theme suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the <UNK> <UNK> leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about black white <UNK> huh br br this is australian film at its finest according to the age
<START> a fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at doing something about them when the chance strikes nothing was easy for morris either he had a family job job <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> etc it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and <UNK> hop on the <UNK> to play <UNK> ball for 4 months it took guts i am glad that they showed his <UNK> almost up <UNK> he got the <UNK> to the <UNK> br br i can remember seeing him pitch against the red sox i think it was a great story though morris actually looks more like john <UNK> or a mills watson than quaid that's okay br br quaid does a very good job playing the man the teacher coach and <UNK> <UNK> as someone who is in the the same age group i certainly can id with his plight you're not quite too old to do what you had <UNK> of as a kid but it's getting there you have to do it sooner than <UNK> br br <UNK> told nicely edited paced acted good to see the familiar faces of the late <UNK> <UNK> brian cox and rachel <UNK> here br br good job all around glad to see it hit br br outta who <UNK> thought that the <UNK> devil <UNK> <UNK> been the subject of such a good movie early on
<START> slow incomprehensible boring three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book this is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book the best part of the movie was the scenery excellent the worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful <UNK> the editing is abrupt and <UNK> however despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script it was startling that although set in <UNK> there was hardly a person of <UNK> descent wandering about the set even in the flashback scenes depicting <UNK> in the <UNK> century if you have any sense of history try to avoid this movie
<START> at one point <UNK> lucy liu tells neil cillian murphy that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure she said because i'm bore <UNK> it mean that she can't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities well i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic because watching the detectives is a cheer boredom br br have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while <UNK> about them afterward but <UNK> life is completely turned around when <UNK> walks into his store she's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him anyway after some dates they decide to see each other the problem is <UNK> is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and can't really doing something normal whereas neil is completely opposite to hers the question is is they are going to be in love at the end you bet br br watching the detectives is a clich√© romantic comedy to its core and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else from the first couple of set up we know that neil is pretty laid back guy who didn't really commit to anything and then <UNK> enters the scene looking all weird and annoying so at this point we all know that we're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they're going to end up in the end is it worth waiting for i would say no br br as i said they tried to give something more for the audience watching the detectives is trying to talk about commitment to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire we knew in the end that insane things that <UNK> has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart or whatever well i think it is completely <UNK> this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself forget about it that girl is one of a <UNK> after <UNK> with many great directors recently danny <UNK> sunshine and 28 days later ken <UNK> the wind that shakes the <UNK> and neil <UNK> breakfast on <UNK> to name a few it's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy <UNK> paul <UNK> by all means he's not bad as usual but such a talent actor like him shouldn't be wasting his time in the movie like this on the other hand lucy liu is dreadfully awful as <UNK> her acting is a mess i mean it's all over the place and so over the top tony montana would have been proud br br the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title you simply can't really connect a <UNK> between the plot and its title and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all in short watching the detectives is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you couldn't imagine br br <UNK> rating 1 5 4
<START> ok i know that a lot of people will probably <UNK> this review as <UNK> down is a classic and a standard part of most people's childhood but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 i must admit i really hated it br br we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who <UNK> at the very words <UNK> down their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the <UNK> recommended it to be honest i wish i hadn't bothered i gave it the benefit of the doubt generally i don't like to stop watching a film half way through this was an exception it was really really excruciatingly <UNK> dull this film was possibly the <UNK> thing i've ever watched imagine a <UNK> up <UNK> in space and really didn't do it for me the art was alright the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and <UNK> yet the <UNK> themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite <UNK> and poorly produced br br i'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline basically it is the tale of a group of <UNK> who leave their warren due to the <UNK> of humans in the area generally a <UNK> story about the <UNK> of human interactions on the environment it uses <UNK> <UNK> to put the message across for me i kind of wished that they would get <UNK> not because i'm a horrible sadistic person but because the characters were uninspiring annoying dull and generally quite rude oh i'm so terribly english i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened and even that was a terrible <UNK> br br if i were to praise it in any way i'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the <UNK> of building on the countryside and hopefully <UNK> the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well meaning maybe it is all in general <UNK> and preachy but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature the musical score was not bad too br br so to conclude this film is pretty poor i couldn't watch it the whole way through or i'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom granted it isn't <UNK> bad but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes so i've given it a 2 10 br br hope this helps
<START> i'm fond of this film and it <UNK> me that so many reviewers rank it below the peter jackson trilogy a filmed novel is always <UNK> in particular an animated film relies on the <UNK> vision and should be judged on its own terms speaking as a <UNK> this is a <UNK> homage to <UNK> than the updated version while this film has its flaws it stays <UNK> to the source especially so far as the characters are concerned br br in the jackson version <UNK> <UNK> is barely recognizable from the first scenes he is portrayed as a <UNK> constantly <UNK> manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet this is physically and <UNK> true you wonder why fate chose this limp <UNK> to carry the one ring to the cracks of doom jackson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of his finest moment when he allows <UNK> to rescue him from the <UNK> bakshi's version respects the original presenting a <UNK> who demands the <UNK> go back and trouble me no more bakshi <UNK> <UNK> character as <UNK> conceived it we see his decline as the weight of his burden <UNK> <UNK> is so pivotal to lord of the rings you wonder why jackson took such liberties he does so with numerous characters since character development <UNK> the plot to its inevitable conclusion bakshi's film better explores the <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> in a few <UNK> scenes that are completely lacking in jackson's version similarly we see <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and merry <UNK> the idea of <UNK> for my liking the <UNK> is more developed in the animated version than the live action br br <UNK> poetry is an important <UNK> in the novels and bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes when <UNK> sings the merry old <UNK> song minutes before stumbling into <UNK> the <UNK> tune is <UNK> <UNK> with the darker theme music when seconds later invisible to his friends but visible to the <UNK> <UNK> is dangerously exposed this is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever i see it br br the well documented budget time <UNK> limit this film's final impact but had it been completed it may have <UNK> with more viewers as it is it's worth a look even its <UNK> admit that peter jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype
<START> okay my title is kinda lame and almost sells this flick short i remember watching <UNK> ebert in <UNK> talking about this movie and then playing a clip or two not being a rap conscious guy although i could identify <UNK> <UNK> vanilla ice and <UNK> hammer music i wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film but then s e showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name using some shady logic and a bunch of made up facts and then another scene where the band and their rival band both visit a school to promote getting involved and of course <UNK> comes up with some info about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good <UNK> in school and was on the <UNK> <UNK> so i <UNK> it away that i should see this movie br br a couple of years later this thing shows up on hbo and i recorded it only to laugh my butt off for hours yes it has a spinal tap kind of rhythm to it even the <UNK> takes essentially the same tone in setting up the clips and the band follows a similar path what i now call the behind the music phenomenon <UNK> band has good chemistry gets famous too much money too fast <UNK> drugs some type of death band breaks up then <UNK> finishing with a hope for more albums in the future and fade to black the one thing that is true is that in spinal tap you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past but tap drags at some points and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes oh this is his rant about the <UNK> food this is spot where he wants the <UNK> to go to eleven this is the spot where the guy makes the <UNK> sized <UNK> etc br br <UNK> to <UNK> which seems to have more unexpected humor you can see some of it coming but there isn't a big setup for every joke sometimes the jokes just kinda flow <UNK> and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked also the direct references to vanilla ice hammer and a bunch of other caricature type <UNK> really worked well this strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes and the songs is my <UNK> better than big bottom from spinal tap i don't know but they're both damn funny tone <UNK> awful video during his awakening phase is so bizarre yet so funny br br i could go on awhile but save your time and don't waste it on <UNK> i watched the first half hour and got bored you don't get bored on <UNK> there are slightly less funny moments but you can never tell when something good is about to happen perhaps my favorite scene is when ice cold and <UNK> taste name <UNK> if i've ever heard any discover they've been sharing the same girl at one point you've got those two pointing guns at each other and the next thing you know the manager the photographer the girl and i think even tone <UNK> are in the room pointing guns at each other switching targets back and forth and of course someone does get shot br br i did find it odd that <UNK> <UNK> suffered similar <UNK> to spinal <UNK> <UNK> although none <UNK> <UNK> i don't think there were enough similarities that i cannot ignore the <UNK> that <UNK> saw spinal tap prior to writing this film although this is clearly much more the spinal tap of hip hop while some similarities exist the humor is different and the movie seems more like a real documentary maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing even the guy who played <UNK> from revenge of the <UNK> all in all this movie has in my opinion street <UNK> kinda like <UNK>
<START> a nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it i saw it on late night tv there are two hardcore stars in it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> thankfully <UNK> hall has just a small part
<START> this movie is like the thousand cat and mouse movies that <UNK> it the following may look like a spoiler but it really just describes a large class of movies there is the passionate wise main character his goofy but well meaning sidekick with his ill placed attempts at humorous comments the initially hostile but soon <UNK> gorgeous lady who <UNK> the inevitable unlikely love story the loved ones taken hostage and of course the <UNK> evil <UNK> with his brutal <UNK> everybody has seen tons of these movies already and national treasure is like any one of them with only a slightly <UNK> <UNK> every turn of the story was easily predicted and i can assure you i am not the <UNK> tool in the shed i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after <UNK> the theater from a hollywood movie and if you have ever felt that way too <UNK> my warning stay miles away from this movie
<START> i am a big fan of cinema <UNK> and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isn't ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the <UNK> killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really <UNK> from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema <UNK> that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben <UNK> deserves some credit
<START> imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as <UNK> doesn't really matter except that it's quite interesting to watch this abstract <UNK> of film and video one of the first art works to <UNK> the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001 released the same year pure <UNK> isn't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers <UNK> <UNK> birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped <UNK> the way for many other <UNK> video artists in the 70s and deserves to be better known
<START> anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions br br 1 the angry eyes look he gives every enemy 2 the holding of the hands to face mouth <UNK> and frightened eyes 3 the smiling tommy <UNK> br br i have to say that i pretty much hate this show i don't watch it but it's like code <UNK> we've all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointless br br every episode ends with <UNK> winning except for one exception when <UNK> basically let this overly geeky <UNK> fly away on a <UNK> br br the jokes are pretty crude too i think it's mostly people saying the word suck or <UNK> i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too br br isn't there one that hides a <UNK> ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to not to mention his older brother who is borderline <UNK> and has no other character qualities br br the whole show i feel is ripping off <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> like you could say the trio of coop jamie and <UNK> as well as <UNK> being similar to <UNK> where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot br br there is simply no appeal to this show i'm surprised that it's still running
<START> while essentially a remake of the original chinese ghost story this third installment has higher production values and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story tony <UNK> is particularly good <UNK> iii is a gorgeous moving film
<START> private practice is being <UNK> off the fairly successful and well written <UNK> <UNK> the cast is fabulous the premise might even work but the writing is just terrible br br the pre pilot disguised as a <UNK> <UNK> episode should have been my first warning the plot was just blah i thought maybe it was a <UNK> so i set the <UNK> to tape the pilot and all other episodes br br as i was watching the pilot i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more there's supposed to be excitement flash great writing intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season amazingly this show had none of that br br thinking it was a <UNK> i just watched the second episode hoping for the best and although <UNK> better it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss tv br br i just <UNK> this show from my list of shows to watch not worth the effort imo and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season pass this one up folks
<START> did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what br br sound effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12 year old wanna be made the film br br most of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really well br br the mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved that's not the case br br turn left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money good thing i didn't rent the movie myself
<START> i couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to <UNK> models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they <UNK> br br more <UNK> unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as <UNK> who of course has grown into a drop dead gorgeous 20 year <UNK> educated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the world not for the money and she <UNK> steve <UNK> on the first date that's when i quit watching br br if you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental self indulgent waste of time
<START> put quite simply this film is terrifying br br it starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film br br don't expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in <UNK> bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed br br each time you watch this film you realise more about what's happening and about how the two worlds in this film <UNK> br br drawings have never been scarier
<START> <UNK> is a beautiful movie about a first love story everyone probably has one and this is writer director <UNK> <UNK> story of hers with a boy called <UNK> we know that her movies have been semi <UNK> of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and <UNK> of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always <UNK> a warm sincerity and honesty <UNK> is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though i must add as a personal bias that <UNK> still has a special place in my heart br br our favourite family is back <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> though this time we go back to when <UNK> is age 10 the characters are all younger from the movies we've <UNK> with them from <UNK> to <UNK> and here <UNK> <UNK> sisters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> take on the roles of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively which perhaps <UNK> for their excellent chemistry together on screen <UNK> that their not playing sibling roles the only constant it seems is <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> and even <UNK> <UNK> has hair on his head through <UNK> the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that <UNK> has introduced us to we come to learn of and understand the family a little bit more set in the days when they're still living in their <UNK> <UNK> back in <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> a chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in <UNK> well she had it in her since young the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless <UNK> <UNK> with the girls and favourite <UNK> include going with the family to football matches br br the arrival of a boy called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the village provides a cool <UNK> for <UNK> to hang out and do stuff with <UNK> through the <UNK> climbing trees flying <UNK> and as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions br br <UNK> does have its <UNK> moments which <UNK> up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as a <UNK> to our own <UNK> of childhood in short those scenes screamed fun we observe the life in a typical <UNK> where some <UNK> are very nice while others the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ill <UNK> <UNK> from envy there are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate <UNK> and the other from <UNK> own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to <UNK> own br br as always <UNK> movies are filled with excellent music and for <UNK> it has something special the song <UNK> as penned by her father as well as <UNK> me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> used in the movie given that the <UNK> movies to date have been <UNK> around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and <UNK> together makes a compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like <UNK> romance love and forgiveness fans will definitely see the many <UNK> in <UNK> back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain <UNK> and significance of recurring characters or events like that <UNK> boy who steals <UNK> at <UNK> br br and speaking of <UNK> parts of <UNK> too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of <UNK> style or deliberately left as such i thought that as a story about childhood <UNK> from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure and subtly i felt that <UNK> <UNK> this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two br br another highly recommended movie and a rare one that i feel is suitable for all ages bring along your kid brother or sister
<START> terrible acting lame plot stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk it was excruciating to sit through just awful do not waste one penny on this the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch this horror film was not even in the least bit scary creepy or disturbing it was in no way visually appealing the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor actress opening their mouth plus the entire story i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story again do not waste your time or money even if it's a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie you will feel dumber for watching it
<START> while it's early to say how the series will <UNK> i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be there is still potential for the series however of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential too but was sorely disappointed my gut tells me enterprise won't be as bad as voyager however br br as for the impressions of the pilot br br the pilot had some good ideas and good themes i liked the introduction the show's opening credits were interesting with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song scott <UNK> is excellent in the role of captain br br where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure the plot of the episode itself was more a generic trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission the plot would be hard to <UNK> between the <UNK> of enterprise <UNK> or <UNK> the central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series br br the plot of <UNK> the first mission would have been grand enough without the action instead of isolated references to the <UNK> of exploration they could have been the story get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it oh for a tv show that once again would make us think make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a <UNK> of <UNK> there was way too much <UNK> br br we had the feeling more that humans were the <UNK> in an established school new kids on the block as opposed to <UNK> into a largely unknown universe sadly the <UNK> landed on our <UNK> instead of us finding them that meeting could have been far more historic and far more <UNK> just how do two such different societies interact don't just hint about it show it br br i had to think of it more as trek with an <UNK> crew and limited <UNK> as opposed to the first brave steps into the <UNK> i wanted to see something newer and <UNK> the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven't seen this new great concept br br i will conclude with <UNK> the sentiment that the series has potential there are some interesting characters <UNK> is wonderful <UNK> has potential the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11 if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme we will have a show which will create new legends br br you shoot an arrow into the air good luck capt archer br br to the producers take more risks and make us think
<START> i caught this at a screening at the sundance film festival and was in awe over the absolute power this film has it is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it the film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into killers for their country and put into the war and the after effects once they return home it also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche it pays homage to the soldiers and never ever <UNK> the soldiers unlike other films instead <UNK> a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned vets br br this film is powerful moving emotional and thought provoking it stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying <UNK> and going to <UNK> but by actually listening to them and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends br br the best film of the festival so far
<START> this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all the sound track along with finely shot hand held camera work was exquisite the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent <UNK> fanning is rapidly becoming a <UNK> in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent as for mr washington and of course christopher walken they both <UNK> the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light
<START> the movie shocked me personally i had herd mostly bad buzz well finally after <UNK> the dvd for months now i <UNK> it in on a <UNK> night though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his <UNK> from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes the best thing about the movie is it's <UNK> with the relationship there were no <UNK> popping up or characters threatening the relationship i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate they date something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie but this movie did not follow that mold we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also it's no my fair lady but it is a spirited and honest film i'll simply say i like it
<START> i have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10 10 from the kids and me
<START> this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end it has a very <UNK> story and very good selected music the acting of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is satisfying recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie
<START> in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clich√©s obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promised br br however after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one <UNK> <UNK> gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilarious br br the <UNK> ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tall br br sure you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
<START> i'm sitting here <UNK> 2006 and i still can't help rave about this movie <UNK> best movies came in about a 4 5 year span running man predator and total recall 1990 all 3 are amazing the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and <UNK> recall they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in <UNK> but you can't help but <UNK> at the 80's style <UNK> on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television <UNK> in the running man studio which we all know here in 2006 are on the way out with the <UNK> of flat <UNK> and <UNK> also the computer graphics of the the running man game show intro would not look like that in <UNK> nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today's movie's i really think that <UNK> acting is much better than he's given credit for now i would not have elected him <UNK> but that's california for you <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are fantastic <UNK> as well and i find the producers don't try to <UNK> the fight scenes when the stalker is dead he's dead it doesn't go on for 20 minutes each the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don't try and <UNK> it i give this movie a 10 10 and that's coming from someone who doesn't enjoy a lot of movies these days if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic <UNK> displays that you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary
<START> personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie it's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed slow and not very convincing if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie then the only thing worth listening to is the <UNK> logan audio commentary br br but in any case since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to br br overall when it comes to movies i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word <UNK>
<START> when the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a <UNK> of california i was wondering if i got the tapes mixed up then i <UNK> a sigh of relief to see paul thomas in a scene with the lovely joanna storm and laurie smith this is being <UNK> on by jimmy a young tom byron <UNK> aunt honey wilder is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher kay parker i could do without the animal robot role playing or the incest aspects there's one good sex scene between byron and parker but it's not good enough to save this film br br my grade d
<START> there isn't a whole lot going on in this story just two men <UNK> very different ways of handling memories of vietnam but what it lacks in premise it more than makes up for in acting and realism it's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience we even get romance not gratuitous just another very real piece of this story it's well worth seeing
<START> when i was <UNK> of our <UNK> <UNK> one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities one of the best things to come along in 1972 was groove tube the original premise was that it was being shown off off broadway in theaters where television <UNK> were being placed throughout the audience so everyone had a great seat the premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis ala saturday night live keeping the thing fresh they decided on making it into a film for general distribution br br i believe the <UNK> said it was the first time chevy chase was on film watching him run naked though the woods was a <UNK> like many of the reviews before mine it was saturday night live before such a thing existed i highly recommend this <UNK> i've told my 13 year old son about <UNK> the clown he can't wait to get a copy
<START> i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost 30 years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent <UNK> down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald <UNK> was superb br br on the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the <UNK> e g nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can't really say it is carpenter's best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is <UNK> i think he made it halloween is the <UNK> achievement of the horror genre
<START> as a 90 minute experience it is not up to the standard of <UNK> as the actors clearly <UNK> their trade at the who am i ' academy while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark <UNK> beat 'em up however those who enjoyed <UNK> and i thought it was wonderful will undoubtedly enjoy this too you certainly won't <UNK> back to the start and watch it all again but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come br br it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being <UNK> even if not in hong kong and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets time and respect <UNK> to the likes of <UNK> woo <UNK> and corey <UNK> <UNK> if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat <UNK> is magnificent and can really bust a move with some magnificent <UNK> kicks and simple acts of bravery br br if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy then track it down and watch it it's not shakespeare in fact it's less <UNK> than <UNK> in china strike <UNK> but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a <UNK> car br br
<START> i have to be completely honest in saying first that i fell asleep somewhere in the middle so i cannot give a full opinion about the film until i see it in full basically a group of thieves including sid carter sid james and ernie <UNK> bernard <UNK> plan to make a fortune stealing a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> hospital this is where title character <UNK> <UNK> jacques works along with staff members sir bernard cutting kenneth williams dr francis <UNK> charles <UNK> dr <UNK> terry scott and nurse susan ball barbara <UNK> patients and their <UNK> are around too including pregnant mrs <UNK> joan <UNK> and her nervous dad to be husband mr <UNK> kenneth connor also starring bill <UNK> as freddy and <UNK> wendy richard as miss willing this plan by the way is not working out by the way because all the staff are getting in the way that's pretty much all can say about the film until i see it again in full okay
<START> i was honestly surprised by alone in the dark it was so bad i could hardly believe what i was seeing there are no characters just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed the extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an <UNK> and that's about it there was no real plot and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation in fact many action scenes just began on their own coming from nowhere with a <UNK> <UNK> track while i was watching this movie i kept asking where is this happening what's going on the acting was high school drama quality with stiff wooden delivery as though the actors were reading from cue cards without <UNK> their lines their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design <UNK> sounded like it was recorded in an open room the actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks looking almost robotic in their movements so these <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios often without even the benefit of transition scenes they were here now they're there this was happening now that's happening random scenes with little rhyme or reason i had a lot of fun watching it definitely not worth nine bucks though
<START> this is definitely the worst movie <UNK> ever done but at this point in his life he was just happy to have a movie there are 3 or 4 laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it don't waste your time i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies but it sucked
<START> this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about <UNK> that ben and <UNK> flop earlier this summer the order was clearly edited to such an <UNK> degree that the scenes rather than <UNK> a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of <UNK> sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a <UNK> plot now i'm a heath ledger fan 10 things i hate about you a <UNK> tale and particularly his supporting role in <UNK> ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent keep accepting scripts like the order and four <UNK> and he's going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion br br here are the problems i had with the film firstly the director tried to make up for the <UNK> of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything plot <UNK> involving the american trying to take over the <UNK> and the dark <UNK> while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters the attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best secondly please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by <UNK> into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory we had <UNK> angst <UNK> love and most <UNK> <UNK> sex that seemed like a page right out of matrix <UNK> with skull numbing <UNK> music rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing <UNK> in the seats <UNK> and most importantly this movie seemed to ha <UNK> an intriguing concept we have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone's background we learn a little about alex but even he gives up the passion of the <UNK> to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an <UNK> at some point in the past and alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire film br br as the cliche goes nowadays if you're going to see one movie this year make sure it's not this one there's about ten interesting minutes out of the <UNK> 101 minute affair the only thing that saved me was going with a girl who i'm rather fond of br br 1 out of 10 i'm disappointed file this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing heath my man go back to <UNK> ball like cameos they really suit you
<START> an unconventional historical drama with some fine battle scenes <UNK> maguire gives an excellent performance and gets some pretty good back up the script is <UNK> and pretty original and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes that said it does drag a bit and the last reel is too much like a tv mini series still <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> keeps one interested in the dull bits and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for david lynch worth seeing
<START> first off there's absolutely no <UNK> going on in this film with anthony or anyone else these people don't <UNK> they just do it your first test of <UNK> is to <UNK> through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual <UNK> this wouldn't be so bad hell i like violence and <UNK> as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is <UNK> so you make it through the torture and mayhem then we meet donna and the movie turns into something all together different not better just different a road picture without heart there are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos <UNK> written and <UNK> played by <UNK> like judy <UNK> and <UNK> stole and a few <UNK> and drag queens too they all deserve better the photography is <UNK> <UNK> so if you get motion sickness or really any kind of sickness this flick is not for you come to think of it i'm not sure just who this flick is for except maybe gay and <UNK> sexual s m fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot <UNK> films about themselves
<START> the sitcom <UNK> around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions as she had the power of magic she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself frequently resulting in literal <UNK> that are often disastrous and always humorous br br the program began with <UNK> adventures in high school in the fictional town of <UNK> located near boston <UNK> as opposed to <UNK> in the comics in the <UNK> later seasons sabrina <UNK> from high school and <UNK> in college then moved on to her attempts to live on her own and keep a job at the local newspaper breaking further from its comic roots the show ended with <UNK> wedding although in the end she abandoned the wedding and ran off with harvey br br many episodes involve sabrina getting to meet through natural or supernatural means popular real life musical artists of the time including <UNK> the violent <UNK> the <UNK> boys phantom planet <UNK> jones of the <UNK> britney spears <UNK> <UNK> daniel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crush savage garden <UNK> sync and <UNK> course of nature the band of melissa joan <UNK> then boyfriend now husband mark <UNK> appeared in an episode in 2002
<START> after just having watched the deer hunter which is a masterpiece the movie <UNK> had big shoes to fill it has same themes as the deer hunter the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war robert de niro is in this film as in the deer hunter and is very good here as is kathy baker but this movie belongs to ed harris who gives a powerful emotional and <UNK> performance the movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play that was not that big a deal and doesn't really <UNK> the film i actually really liked this movie it's not an epic like the deer hunter they are about similar era and have similar themes but they are two very different films i thought the deer hunter was great and i also think this movie was great it's the acting in this one that makes it so great for me <UNK> is a 10 10
<START> i probably <UNK> my knowledge of iran when i saw secret <UNK> 2001 now i know about four times as much i doubt i learned a whole heck of a lot from not without my daughter 1991 br br <UNK> is a splendid budget iranian comedy about a group a girls working <UNK> to attend a <UNK> soccer match for their country's place in the world cup women are not allowed to attend soccer matches so the <UNK> armed forces have been <UNK> to save any women who try to enter from themselves some teen girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys but are caught the movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are <UNK> by soldiers awaiting some <UNK> punishment although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one <UNK> away from being executed br br the movie explores the absurdity of the situation the thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the <UNK> <UNK> philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago this farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom so a soldier <UNK> her demands that she cover her eyes so she can't see the <UNK> the conflict is not entirely about the battle of the <UNK> at one point some <UNK> <UNK> between a <UNK> who is rural and the girls who are urban br br fortunately this movie was not too <UNK> <UNK> that the comedy was lost on this <UNK> and cultural cousin of the great satan you have to be in the mood for it but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they won't get it
<START> this is one of those awful sex driven b movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater women run around dressed in scantily clad bunny outfits an extremely fat woman is the <UNK> of many tasteless jokes and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an oddball son jim hanks who is of course <UNK> brother whom the man wants to get laid hanks is actually sort of good but this movie goes nowhere and has no point one must wonder why it was even made nevertheless because of <UNK> performance and a few entertaining moments but no more than a few it received a stellar 2 out of 10 i think i was being nice though
<START> jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and <UNK> the opportunity to scare his nemesis br br i didn't find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather <UNK> and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the <UNK> <UNK> in this one <UNK> poor tom for no particular reason br br there is the occasional flash of inspiration such as <UNK> literal <UNK> in <UNK> experience and the moment when his <UNK> lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t <UNK> other cartoons
<START> indian directors have it tough they have to compete with movies like <UNK> where 11 <UNK> <UNK> males defend their village and half of them are <UNK> idiots <UNK> a hapless <UNK> <UNK> foreign return drinking to oblivion with characters running in endless corridors oblivious to any one's feelings or sentiments alas they live in an <UNK> <UNK> of red <UNK> and <UNK> but to make a good movie you have to tight rope walk to <UNK> the <UNK> who are the <UNK> <UNK> who are <UNK> with split <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fights preferably involving a <UNK> bollywood leading actor who is <UNK> handsome so you can connect with a director who wants to tell a tale of <UNK> village head who in own words defending his village this is considered a violent movie or too <UNK> for a male audience there are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lets you in his <UNK> and watch him <UNK> and mock the politician when his loyal <UNK> burst in laughter with every word of satire thrown at him meanwhile his daughter is bathing his <UNK> this is as authentic a scene you can get in rural india <UNK> <UNK> is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting which is a disappearing breed in hindi films the violence depicted is an intricate part of storytelling with song dances thrown in for the <UNK> without whom movies won't sell a sad but true state of affairs faster this changes better for bollywood all said and done this is one good movie
<START> i finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it it actually <UNK> my expectations considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well made film the lack of <UNK> actually helped this film in several ways especially given the plot just like the blair witch project this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film another bonus whereas most low budget horror films even the best of the best suffer from mediocre to unintentionally hysterical acting this film actually had a talented cast save one or two characters particularly the two leads the only thing missing from the film was an original storyline it borrows heavily from better known films like deliverance and wrong turn but if you're like me films of this nature never <UNK> to be terrifying plus the director keeps things interesting throughout i'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and i have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out
<START> i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or <UNK> during the one summer in the mid 90's that my parents <UNK> to those channels i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating i was young then in my early teens and now years later after having discovered the great <UNK> howard and being blown away by big bad love i bought the dvd of wilder <UNK> and re watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years i absolutely loved it i was really impressed and affected by it there are so many dynamic fluid <UNK> and <UNK> within the camera movements and cinematography all of which perfectly <UNK> with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well it's truly cinematic i love <UNK> <UNK> subtle intensity <UNK> strength and hidden intelligence i'm a big fan of anything he does and his interplay with debra <UNK> manic glee they are of course married has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera i wonder if they watch this on wedding <UNK> big bad love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it it's brilliant and dennis quaid in full clown make up <UNK> introduced <UNK> hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full <UNK> delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don't see very often quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge <UNK> mouth span hiding behind his <UNK> eyes lying in wait to <UNK> itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness here as both both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal <UNK> square offs in darkly cool fashion in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity it's really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination <UNK> and chemistry by all parties involved i really cannot imagine how this got <UNK> and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination less system but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile in a great way with all of its day <UNK> bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly <UNK> truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time <UNK> <UNK> blank now that's a compliment in my book
<START> my brother is an avid dvd collector he took one look at the cover two models on <UNK> and had to add it to his collection i stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most <UNK> movie i use that term loosely i've felt <UNK> to sit through i <UNK> not make eye contact with my brother quite certain he must have been <UNK> the <UNK> in his <UNK> fist the biggest name in the whole movie is michael clark <UNK> who appears in one scene which the filmmaker decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie in fact the whole movie pretty much follows this suit the fact that the dvd contained deleted footage was a shock i went to bed without viewing it however to no surprise at all i found this disc without its case behind the tv about a week later
<START> this is a great game okay perhaps it didn't have some of the features it was meant to have but digital <UNK> have still come up with a good game there is a certain similarity to elite you can trade pick up weapons and <UNK> off destroyed ships go on missions however this game features a heavily scripted mission it is a great mission the control system is different it uses the mouse you basically fly you spaceship around a system and work your way up the game features some pretty good graphics even through it was made in 2003 it should run well on even a <UNK> <UNK> pc the story features some great voice acting from john rhys davies george <UNK> jennifer hale she appears in every computer game stick with the story it gets better and better as it goes on there is even a race section where you and an <UNK> have to race your <UNK> around a course it involves you going through rings this section took me a while to beat it adds variety to the game some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game the game has an active <UNK> scene on the net pick up some <UNK> to <UNK> the game i haven't played any of the <UNK> yet br br sadly a sequel to this was cancelled a shame
<START> ally <UNK> was a decent enough show but it was very overrated the characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short br br i think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave it was starting to <UNK> its welcome
<START> this is a film which had <UNK> me thus far but now that i've watched it emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style as usual with the <UNK> format the viewing was far from ideal ¬ñ marred by the occasional video and mostly audio <UNK> ¬ñ but given that the film is still <UNK> on <UNK> dvd this will have to do for the moment since the film's reputation is quite high within the genre itself i assume that the reason behind this <UNK> is because it does not have a well known actor in the lead br br anyway the <UNK> entrance of the film's <UNK> star ¬ñ <UNK> tone ¬ñ packs quite a <UNK> especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first tone was a underrated actor ¬ñ he was rarely given <UNK> roles and this may well be his best making his <UNK> both fascinating and <UNK> dangerous the female lead ¬ñ ella raines who would later feature in <UNK> force <UNK> as well as <UNK> own the suspect 1944 and the strange affair of uncle harry 1945 ¬ñ is quite lovely and <UNK> takes on the role of the <UNK> secretary out to prove her convicted boss alan <UNK> innocent of his wife's brutal murder other key supporting parts are <UNK> by thomas <UNK> as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator and elisha cook jr ¬ñ the <UNK> quintessential fall guy ¬ñ as an ill <UNK> <UNK> man of a <UNK> br br like <UNK> <UNK> jules <UNK> <UNK> was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction ¬ñ all <UNK> angles and terrific set pieces including the <UNK> celebrated jazz sequence in which cook <UNK> beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the <UNK> <UNK> raines who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he <UNK> evidence at the <UNK> which could spring her <UNK> lover from jail another great lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender another <UNK> witness around the streets of new york ¬ñ which results in his being <UNK> down by a car br br notable too is the trial sequence ¬ñ which is entirely depicted through the audience's reaction so that judge jury witnesses and d a are never actually seen although the <UNK> voice is <UNK> that of veteran character actor samuel s <UNK> the <UNK> of the film is the scene in which <UNK> and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved with the <UNK> put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone <UNK> spells the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment where she discovers evidence of his guilt ¬ñ and he <UNK> to having had an affair with <UNK> wife but killed her when she wouldn't desert her husband for him br br by the way i hit upon a little goof in the film while the story is clearly set in 1943 i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film ¬ñ in which alan curtis <UNK> the titular lady to the theater ¬ñ the establishing shot of new york <UNK> clearly of stock footage features a <UNK> promoting laurel and <UNK> 1938 musical comedy swiss miss incidentally famed mystery writer <UNK> <UNK> wrote the original novel on which this was based using a <UNK>
<START> i get <UNK> all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies and they were not disappointed when i watched this one i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over <UNK> i <UNK> for the family and i <UNK> for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how denzel was fabulous as always and so was chris <UNK> mickey rourke i did not even recognized though the years have not been kind to him my husband is not one to re watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies <UNK> he has watched this movie 5 times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching
<START> <UNK> is the story of a dashing young scientist <UNK> at the local college is brought under investigation by financial <UNK> for the college this forces him to take <UNK> in typical bad hollywood melodramatic fashion br br my first thought after this movies conclusion was this not good but not bad for early to mid eighties of course i then realized that it was made in 1990 which almost <UNK> it down to a <UNK> but decided to keep it at the mediocre <UNK> that it is br br <UNK> does on a few occasions seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out the acting while not stellar is mostly competent you can even see the occasional <UNK> of a modest quality pacing is a large problem with the movie after thinking i had been watching for ninety minutes i realized i'd only been watching an hour special effects aren't stellar but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness br br the lead a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a <UNK> <UNK> of tom cruise and christopher reeves reminded me mostly of matt <UNK> character in <UNK> <UNK> the female heroine does an ok job but does not <UNK> herself in anyway there's a <UNK> <UNK> role in here and the actress does what she can with it but it doesn't seem like much there is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's <UNK> cheerful or just weird br br pacing as i said is the worst problem with this movie until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a power ranger <UNK> it is bizarre and inexplicable until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious <UNK> with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be <UNK> in about thirty seconds br br a decent one time watch on the <UNK> creek 50 chilling movie <UNK> nothing that is going to bring you back and nothing to buy on its own
<START> like the gentle giants that make up the latter half of this film's title michael <UNK> latest production has grace but it's also slow and <UNK> the <UNK> last outing <UNK> 3d had the same problem it's hard to imagine a boring shark movie but they somehow managed it the only draw for hammerhead shark frenzy was it's passable <UNK> which is always fun when dealing with wondrous worlds beneath the <UNK> surface but even that was only passable poor focus in some scenes made the production seems amateurish with <UNK> and <UNK> the technology is all but wasted <UNK> scenes and too many close ups of the film's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of <UNK> stunning 3d <UNK> there are far too few scenes of any depth or variety close ups of these awesome creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the cameras field so there is no contrast of depth michael <UNK> is trying to follow in his father's footsteps but when you've got shark week on cable his <UNK> and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment
<START> this is exactly the sort of saturday <UNK> serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and that's the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must <UNK> at its <UNK> and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the <UNK> and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures 1944 they read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing br br one and half stars
<START> really bad movie maybe the worst i've ever seen alien invasion a la the blob without the acting <UNK> turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue bad plot bad fake tongue absurd comedy worth missing wash your hair or take out the trash
<START> this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet <UNK> leaving the rest to be <UNK> and or shared between the principals as usual the storyline <UNK> <UNK> us though for the record it was based on a play shore leave that also served as the basis for a broadway musical hit the deck anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters as always is the music lyrics and <UNK> and this is all out of the right bottle it's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 we get to see astaire play the piano in real life he was an accomplished <UNK> and composed several songs one of which i'm building up to an awful let down had a <UNK> by johnny <UNK> and spent a couple of weeks in the <UNK> and it is the only one of the series in which he played a <UNK> albeit an ex <UNK> who <UNK> in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts he gets to perform a little known but excellent berlin number i'd rather lead a band as well as <UNK> on i'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the <UNK> in 1936 <UNK> of world war ii were already being felt let's face the music and dance one of the most potent <UNK> ever performed by the team so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish out of water without either a horse or a six gun within easy reach and harriet <UNK> doesn't exactly set the screen on fire we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is do they deliver answer in <UNK>
<START> famous words of foreign nightclub owner roman <UNK> that lousy <UNK> sucker who spends the whole movie not only as johnny <UNK> rival but <UNK> the english language as well br br another underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon <UNK> or late late late show 's johnny dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his mother's medical care and put his brother through law school br br yes there's a story but who cares a cast that includes joe <UNK> dom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and alan hale jr will keep you waiting to see what happens next br br there's too many laughs in this to put on here like airplane you have to pay attention or you'll miss something highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two
<START> this film though ostensibly a comedy is deadly serious its subject is <UNK> with a capital i how britain <UNK> <UNK> tries to convince itself that it's still a great power after world war ii at home the empire is run by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who are so in <UNK> that they can't <UNK> close relatives the <UNK> of government consist of long forgotten <UNK> a dig at <UNK> paranoia inhabited by <UNK> rats and <UNK> rooms <UNK> <UNK> bored <UNK> reading popular novels br br abroad britain <UNK> to the old <UNK> but <UNK> out of context looks <UNK> and silly especially when its <UNK> in bumbling <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an <UNK> picture of decline with none of the <UNK> <UNK> that marred the supposedly anti <UNK> jewel in the crown br br the film is also about the cold war <UNK> <UNK> that it's a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt not fear and respect it's about how <UNK> <UNK> more by neglect than <UNK> destroys the <UNK> it <UNK> robbing them of <UNK> power and most importantly self respect leaving them vulnerable to the <UNK> of dangerous <UNK> br br it's the seriousness of course that kills it that's not to say that <UNK> subjects can't be treated in comedy the miracle of <UNK> creek dr <UNK> and the life of brian have all proved that indeed one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy it allows for a <UNK> eyed view br br the problem with <UNK> <UNK> is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic so that it becomes <UNK> down and unfunny in the three films mentioned above much of the comedy <UNK> from character reaction to an extreme situation not the extreme situation itself here the script is too poor to sustain rich comic <UNK> and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled peter sellers terry thomas raymond <UNK> and john le <UNK> are criminally wasted br br terry thomas sublime so often shows that he couldn't handle lead parts and that he needed to play <UNK> arrogant <UNK> not brainless <UNK> the music is made to carry much of the comedy but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen to be fair unlike the majority of british comedies of the period which were <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> often try to make their points through film itself by montage and composition only <UNK> manages to raise genuine laughs and that's by <UNK> a character he could have played in his sleep br br none of the <UNK> <UNK> have dated well they're never thought through enough although <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the decline of the empire it also seems to be anti <UNK> and <UNK> i'm sure this wasn't intended but these <UNK> are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take <UNK> over comic intelligence and film form
<START> i remember this movie when i was 13 seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing age 13 with a group of school buddies we all wanted to see billy crystal in his first movie and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy we suffered through about 45 minutes of it and all agreed to leave the theater it was grotesque tasteless and a far cry from the ability billy crystal had to make us laugh we were not laughing i stumbled upon this review by accident and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a <UNK> gut waste of film this was now if you rent this you deserve what you get you've been warned
<START> wow sheer brilliance br br turning a thriller suspense horror into comedy br br after watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed either not written in depth or too much depth br br if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch br br be sure to keep focused for the classic food <UNK> scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes br br this is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave
<START> after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller setting it in the <UNK> world of computer companies the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good but when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss <UNK> i waited for it's dvd release then bought it <UNK> home for an enjoyable <UNK> viewing the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film for a start the direction is appalling there's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself so he can appear in the film i wouldn't be <UNK> out to employ him in the future secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan <UNK> <UNK> normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by <UNK> when he's running and having geeky friends but he just doesn't look right the female stars rachel leigh cook and <UNK> <UNK> don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their <UNK> the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story
<START> twisted bizarre enchanting and hilarious i couldn't stop laughing watching this film darren <UNK> presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera manipulation is a strong word however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another br br from the beginning i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear <UNK> whenever possible later darren comments about his budding homosexuality and you can see it from the hints big hints of <UNK> at an early age maybe it was just the warm southern california weather who knows as a gay man who also grew up in a <UNK> environment it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him and that his friends seemed to be <UNK> with his <UNK> talent behind the lens br br put the camera on me offers a look back to the 80's <UNK> by <UNK> you'll remember the hair the music and the fashions i'm the same age as mr <UNK> so the trip back to memory lane was welcome his solo lip <UNK> dance number is priceless enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t shirt br br the films deal with dark themes at time child abuse the holocaust nuclear war sexual fantasy and social <UNK> no childhood is completely <UNK> and the way <UNK> deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least and hilarious to behold br br watch at your earliest <UNK>
<START> i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old <UNK> theatre as part of a saturday afternoon <UNK> triple bill which also featured vincent <UNK> last man on earth and mario <UNK> nightmare castle i had nightmares about blood <UNK> ghosts for a week afterwards though i didn't know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre no wonder i was so scared though all three films frightened me it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact br br it was the first on the bill i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about <UNK> minutes the <UNK> runs <UNK> but despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined <UNK> fog <UNK> <UNK> shadows and <UNK> gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the <UNK> out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection since it was a french italian <UNK> it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in <UNK> i couldn't quite remember the title remember i didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka <UNK> macabre coffin of terror castle of terror long night of terror etc and the usa uk working title castle of blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it <UNK> but thanks to the internet and <UNK> i found it at last what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy but as haunted house movies go it's stands up well and <UNK> <UNK> to similar iconic films of the period such as the haunting the <UNK> or black sunday the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio <UNK> it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio <UNK> about a <UNK> writer georges <UNK> who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and <UNK> becomes part of an <UNK> ongoing ghostly story the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest as is <UNK> <UNK> as dr <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as julia br br many of the tricks <UNK> employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere <UNK> <UNK> doors fog etc are bound to seem clich√© to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances <UNK> does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying <UNK> secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the <UNK> writer br br the film is not without faults the pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes i originally missed this is probably <UNK> by <UNK> films effort to <UNK> the film to its original length though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the intro it may have been more of <UNK> than a help the english voice <UNK> are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from english to french english subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers br br however <UNK> films deserves kudos for the quality of the print clearly some effort was put into its <UNK> and deservedly so br br i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to <UNK> of 60's italian <UNK> films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story br br rob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> canada
<START> i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story br br but since this is a biopic it's important to at least know what to expect from the character br br i don't know if the manner the events are told are true or if it everything is fictional but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief but that's just my opinion br br this is a solid western type movie for everybody's tastes heath ledger is great as always and the sexy <UNK> <UNK> charms the screen br br give this movie a chance if it <UNK> on cable otherwise i don't think i could recommend it
<START> i have seen a lot of <UNK> films and always found amazing the way he <UNK> music dance drama and great cinema in his movies <UNK> shows an even better <UNK> dealing with <UNK> concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation <UNK> not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing the interest of <UNK> on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more <UNK> in turning this movie maybe the most <UNK> exciting among his other works that's why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art
<START> i will start this off by saying i couldn't get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from <UNK> like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasn't any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who <UNK> this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity that's the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs <UNK> the acting <UNK> much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos <UNK> who cares <UNK> <UNK> is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser that's about as much of the plot as i understood br br overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in br br my response is always well now you can br br
<START> i completely agree with <UNK> this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to see it and <UNK> i watched it anyway about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity but sat through until the end just to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had not it was disgusting nothing happened and the ending was all preachy no movie that bad has the right to survive i <UNK> all of you to spare yourself the terror of <UNK> drives the bus if only i had <UNK> the same warning please save yourself from this movie i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie and should all be wiped off the face of the planet
<START> howling ii 1985 was a complete <UNK> from the first film whilst the first film was campy and creepy the second one was sleazy and cheesy the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious the brother of the <UNK> werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his <UNK> the scene from the first film was badly re created a skinny plain looking woman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brown to the old country romania to <UNK> the mystery to her sister's murder transformation death christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a <UNK> guide to the two <UNK> <UNK> and her two biggest <UNK> appear as <UNK> the head werewolf of the romania she also suffers from a bad case of morning face <UNK> br br bad movie there's nothing good about this stinker i'm surprise <UNK> <UNK> directed this picture because he's usually a good film maker the film is so dark that you need a <UNK> to watch it no not the content but the film stock itself to round the movie off you get a lousy punk performance from a damned wannabe <UNK> maybe if they <UNK> over a couple of extra bucks they could've got the real deal instead of an imitation br br best to avoid unless you're desperate or you lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel
<START> okay it seems like so far only the <UNK> fans have commented on this film time for a <UNK> beware this <UNK> is long br br for those not in the knowing mostly the non <UNK> tom <UNK> director of this film is the <UNK> of <UNK> one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in <UNK> basically they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale then <UNK> started hurting and the band basically fell apart with <UNK> and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the <UNK> <UNK> the way it always happens in such cases the post breakdown <UNK> was a lot <UNK> and less interesting than the original they tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album the ideal crash in 1999 presenting a much <UNK> form of their earlier style of <UNK> they didn't quite make it however <UNK> were still pretty big it seems big enough for <UNK> to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies br br more often than not this sort of thing is a very big mistake and this film does not make the exception and <UNK> clearly went for art on this one another very big mistake for one thing he's a musician not a movie director for another <UNK> at it's best made fun and provoking music but never anything close to what i would consider art it shows br br so what's this movie about basically it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in <UNK> as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting the characters are shallow the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings humor the whole film made me smile slightly about 3 times and actually managed to <UNK> a single 5 second laugh not quite loud mood the film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all mystery well minor spoiler the idea of the wind man inspiring the name of the film is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza not very and has been done a thousand times before anyone remember <UNK> destiny one of <UNK> worst appearances on film to date end minor spoiler and well its artistic so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous in other words except for the few smiles it bored me out of my shorts br br so what remains well the soundtrack is pretty good though it suffers from some of the same problems that other <UNK> have shown lately first it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the cd second it gives the impression that <UNK> is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs which simply doesn't work in the end it makes the film look like nothing more than an <UNK> to the songs and sadly it's <UNK> own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as i'm concerned all in all it just stands to show that <UNK> knows more about music than movies camera work is okay as well though not anything that would make you scream out with joy br br the only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight seeing factor since i <UNK> from <UNK> it was fun to play a kind of guess the location game i would hardly consider this as a quality though br br all in all another chance lost for <UNK> film i keep on <UNK> that lately the best <UNK> movies have been coming from the french part of the country this is mostly because at least they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional the brothers <UNK> come to mind maybe the <UNK> art house filmmakers should try that too
<START> had a bad day dog bit the <UNK> car wouldn't start people got on your nerves then <UNK> yourself with a delightful experience br br two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a <UNK> rental of a villa in italy due to financial circumstances two other women join them two have <UNK> marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life br br as the spell of the villa <UNK> their spirits each grows in her own way and is <UNK> in her <UNK> this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them and you will find your <UNK> altered for the better a delightfully uplifting movie
<START> wow i thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than i imagined sometimes i like to watch a good car crash movie those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get this is really the only reason i could leave the television on morbid fascination it wasn't so much the acting which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day the script too is <UNK> inducing as for cinematography did anyone else notice that they used a <UNK> drawing <UNK> device like in an old 50's tv show but without irony at first i thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue in cheek manner don't even ask me about the score the only high point is the final song by <UNK> i guess they wanted to leave people with something for their 8 glad i saw it on tv just silly i wonder if this is why timothy <UNK> has had trouble finding much work recently i guess if you don't expect much and want to watch a mindless thriller it would be better than spending an evening <UNK> your <UNK> which is why it merits a 2
<START> i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn't impressed i know it's taboo to knock independent films but this one felt devoid of entertainment br br the premise was interesting but the execution of it fell short i found myself thinking okay they're just getting into it the story will pick up soon before i knew it the film was over and the story never picked up i can't say i found the acting all that impressive either it was pretty bad not star wars prequel trilogy bad but bad nonetheless br br i'm not sure what the running time was i'll assume two hours because it's a safe <UNK> anyway when the film was finished i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i <UNK> in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through br br again i was thoroughly <UNK> and eventually bored out of my wits i'm not one of those guys who requires fast paced action and explosions in a film so don't start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it
<START> another example of the unique talents of cary grant a performance worthy of oscar consideration yet once again <UNK> by the academy mr grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city the <UNK> of building a home are well <UNK> and became the basis loosely for the more modern tom hanks vehicle the money pit br br if you like good old fashioned comedy without the <UNK> and the gratuitous sex this movie is a must see
<START> <UNK> brings us some mildly shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously absolutely a classic in it's own particular kind of way this movie provides a <UNK> different look at <UNK> if you get a chance to see this movie do so you'll definitely have a smile on your face most of the time not because it's funny or anything mundane like that but because it's so bad it goes out the other way and becomes good though maybe not clean fun
<START> i went to see this movie with my 17 y o daughter i insisted we go the <UNK> showing not because i'm a <UNK> but just feeling i had in the <UNK> spirit this is a <UNK> dream so much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info <UNK> if it weren't for the so called acting keeping with tradition the <UNK> franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a <UNK> no pun intended for this <UNK> of a motion picture earlier <UNK> <UNK> although cheesy as well were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to <UNK> ms <UNK> disney's <UNK> drama queen has little acting ability i was surprised that mr keaton and mr dillon would get involved in such a project only the <UNK> bar was a bigger ripoff
<START> a friend once told me that an art house independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film audiences were so <UNK> they <UNK> to tear up the cinema seats of course my imagination ran amok trying to <UNK> up the <UNK> of such a piece of work well now my imagination can be put to rest br br i am a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fan and an <UNK> admirer of his work i have come across many people who thought <UNK> films are slow moving and <UNK> opinions being what they are i found this not to be true of the late director's wonderful works which are <UNK> with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions upon hearing <UNK> <UNK> called the heir to <UNK> i was excited to experience his films br br with the exception of the open air ride through the fields stalker this movie has no <UNK> to anything <UNK> has done it does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level it's supposedly <UNK> stark cinematography is devoid of any <UNK> craft there is a no balance no <UNK> and the exposure <UNK> seems to be running low on <UNK> in the <UNK> snow the main character is so inept and <UNK> it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner br br i am also not <UNK> to non plots or story lines that progress on multiple non linear fashion but there isn't even a non story here one must surely enter the viewing of this film with a <UNK> head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hair pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a <UNK> time <UNK> look as if jerry bruckheimer had filmed a charlie chaplin short br br i won't rule out that this may be one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but to conclude that he is one of <UNK> heir based on this film would be to call paris hilton the <UNK> to <UNK> c'mon guys don't be afraid to say it no amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life i don't <UNK> to fully understand russian culture and i probably don't have russian values but i immediately picked up on <UNK> work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewers br br if it didn't have <UNK> name on it and it aired on say saturday night live i'm pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet <UNK> of a flick
<START> <UNK> journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons the acting of clara <UNK> is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions director <UNK> <UNK> presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby <UNK> the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring the screenplay of angel garcia <UNK> is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all the plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people it was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any americans know of it in fact in 40 years of university teaching i <UNK> about one student a <UNK> who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything <UNK> about it and the overwhelming number of students were merit <UNK> all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education so in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is <UNK> the appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of one's knowledge to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely the left <UNK> <UNK> considers seven aspects of film acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistry on a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help <UNK> journey is above average on all counts <UNK> dialogue which is rated as average the <UNK> average for this film is 9 3 raised to a 10 when <UNK> to the imdb scale i highly recommend this film for all ages
<START> this movie is obviously low budget filmed in british columbia canada the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing set in california late 60's 80's were well conceived i believe this is the best most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of <UNK> the bay area from 1968 19 he was never caught edward james <UNK> <UNK> dave <UNK> george <UNK> zodiac at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen since <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> play a game of cat mouse re visiting crime scenes together each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation <UNK> dying from some type of <UNK> disease knowing <UNK> did it still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way <UNK> totally oblivious self absorbed like all serial killers to the carnage left in his wake the only disappointment was the over the top ending otherwise pretty accurate if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case check it out
<START> home room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her <UNK> because it had her daughter's name on it my heart felt as if it had <UNK> just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet i loved it so much
<START> i loved the first season the quality went down a little bit in the second season which however had a great middle <UNK> third season was fairly novel and original and was ok fourth season started going downhill fast because they never even began giving us any explanations when by now we were really starting to need them what the hell was the <UNK> plan why were there two <UNK> <UNK> what was the point of angel <UNK> leading the fleet to a <UNK> earth 1 what kind of a past did the last five <UNK> have and how did they survive or were they <UNK> questions everywhere answers nowhere br br and then comes the end earth 2 our earth in the past well okay but destroying the fleet giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life and <UNK> a few thousand people paper <UNK> across the planet that's not only anti science it's anti reason and anti life and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> society <UNK> destructive a i that ruins everything it is without vision without hope for a <UNK> future for humanity and it is <UNK> to proper science fiction and don't even get me started on the angels religious <UNK> of the worst kind the ultimate disappointment br br the whole all this has happened before and will happen again thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series not just to earth as we know it making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius <UNK> shame br br 1 out of 10
<START> christ a sequel to one of the most <UNK> films of all time this at least has the decency to leave out the songs bar a <UNK> of the unbearable tomorrow but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny this time annie and her friends head off to london and get caught up in joan <UNK> plot to blow up <UNK> palace or some such <UNK> the movie has a <UNK> <UNK> attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i could feel my teeth <UNK> themselves down into <UNK> <UNK> photographed <UNK> and plodding the movie has only one memorable line <UNK> me you stupid genius and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it
<START> when <UNK> came out the reviews praised it but i didn't get around to seeing it i finally saw it when it got released on video and understand the glowing reviews br br the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto we quickly get introduced to student diana <UNK> michelle rodriguez she has a bad ass expression on her face and any idea about diana that we might <UNK> from this expression soon gets <UNK> when she gets in a fight as diana gets in trouble for this we then meet her father an aggressive type in his own right clearly we can't totally blame diana for her attitude br br but then the movie really picks up as a new thought <UNK> in <UNK> mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence her older brother has already gotten into boxing but her father most likely won't <UNK> only diana herself can decide what to do br br just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty non hollywood movie but the brief appearance of john <UNK> in a supporting role truly <UNK> that even before they get to any boxing scenes you feel like you're getting <UNK> in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives and when they finally arrive at the film's main story there's no turning back br br all in all i definitely recommend this movie i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself herself has been sort of a clich√© in cinema for many years rocky million dollar baby but i still think that they did a great job with it here in fact this may have brought the genre to its <UNK> really good too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one
<START> this was shown as part of the <UNK> <UNK> international festival though for reasons best left to the powers that be a lot seems to have been made of the fact that it's the first <UNK> language film made with <UNK> actors crew but directed by a <UNK> <UNK> have bothered to be honest as this film is dull dull dull why hint at something why <UNK> an idea in mystery why subtly <UNK> a feeling when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs obvious shots and over the top scenes nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director <UNK> clumsily <UNK> out endless clich√©s no <UNK> no guessing it's all up on screen no need to use our <UNK> wonder when the <UNK> bit is coming no you wont 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more <UNK> rising to a <UNK> of <UNK> hell i'm making up words to describe how bad this is wonder whether the <UNK> demon is real or imaginary why tax yourself it's really is a snake and yes it's really is biting his <UNK> and there's blood <UNK> everywhere it's a strange uneasy film for several reasons it's supposed to be a horror film but it's not scary the <UNK> are <UNK> obvious it might be a <UNK> attack on the <UNK> side of thailand yet the director has a sleazy <UNK> style when it comes to showing barely <UNK> teens maybe it was casting himself as the virginity taking <UNK> that planted the <UNK> of doubt in my head or maybe the whole thing was just pants uninspired insipid repetitive hackneyed all candidates for best description but dull seems most appropriate and honest it's all been seen before probably better often with more thought rarely with less imagination or <UNK> sorry thumbs down on every count truly dire
<START> wow this is a good movie the acting wasn't good at all but if you look at some moments in the film <UNK> and watch it again it is genius the man in the begin of the film walks with his <UNK> against a three wow i never expected that then he puts the coke in a <UNK> and runs away i bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later and the genius quotes <UNK> shades i need a <UNK> <UNK> yours if you think you can take them <UNK> just brilliant and the fighting is the best i've seen in a while look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table what a hit and in the middle of the film one guy in a car shot one time then 3 guys fall he is really good at aiming it costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him the end was brilliant it was so exciting that james <UNK> walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves jason peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead i can't say with more words how great this movie is
<START> my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen <UNK> affects people it just demonstrated how teen <UNK> affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny <UNK> girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such i wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script <UNK> the <UNK> of the baby mother is a riot she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly <UNK> when people spy on her through her <UNK> room window <UNK> the father best friend's name is <UNK> and is an obvious rip off of sean <UNK> character in fast times at <UNK> high this movie is horrid simply because none of the characters are believable thank goodness it's only made for tv <UNK> the <UNK> chances of viewing it
<START> such is the dilemma above that debbie must face at the close of this sam <UNK> production naughty <UNK> debbie has just hit town become a <UNK> slept with an elderly rich man who she describes is in his 50's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met and then is the central element to a kidnapping <UNK> plot through it all and amidst all that emotional <UNK> and soul searching what in <UNK> name will debbie do well i cannot give it away completely but don't expect any real <UNK> here let's face it naughty <UNK> is just what it wants to be at least two thirds through a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that <UNK> 70's way film there is no grand art here the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put <UNK> <UNK> in films so that the audience could live out <UNK> their <UNK> tastes by todays standards the film is pretty tame what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end c'mon anyone here believing that little <UNK> by debbie while on the beach <UNK> life she would spend more time picking out which <UNK> top she will wear that day then do that and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand it didn't make sense to me so how on earth did these characters dig it anyone buying cal as a member of the <UNK> something like that or even as a director for hardcore pornography he would be luck to get work at seven eleven this is as another reviewer noted more of a sam <UNK> piece then and al <UNK> piece you can tell when al is in complete charge there is virtually no budget and the film doesn't look nearly as polished as this <UNK> does a decent job directing this time and i have to give <UNK> credit to a degree while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be it has a certain style to it i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs i even liked the music of <UNK> silver heels was a somewhat catchy tune the movie doesn't look cheap really at all compare that to any of <UNK> horror films as for the cast yes bob <UNK> is a bit old for the lead but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well i had major problems with robert <UNK> who was just plain awful in his role the girls have all got great sets so what else was required of them huh naughty <UNK> is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade by the way did i mention it is a pretty bad picture
<START> sasquatch hunters actually wasn't as bad as i thought br br spoilers br br traveling into the woods park rangers charles <UNK> kevin <UNK> roger gordon matt <UNK> brian <UNK> david <UNK> spencer combs rick holland and his sister janet <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dr helen gilbert amy <UNK> white her boss dr ethan <UNK> gary <UNK> and assistant louise keaton <UNK> <UNK> to find the site of some <UNK> bones found in the area when they make camp the team discovers a giant burial ground and more strange bones <UNK> the area when members of the group start to disappear they start to wander through the woods to safety it's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survive br br the good news this wasn't as bad as i thought it would be the movie really starts to pick up some steam at around the half way point when the creature attacks that is a masterful series of scenes as the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature and the suspense throughout the entire play out is extremely high the <UNK> area is most appropriately <UNK> during these parts <UNK> the tension and wondering when a single person wandering around in the forest will get their <UNK> also spread quite <UNK> through the movie is the effective use of off screen <UNK> and <UNK> that are truly <UNK> they really do add much to make this part so creepy as well as the other times the <UNK> <UNK> is heard it's quite effective and works well it's quite nice that the later part of the film picks up the pace as it goes out pretty well on a high note of action one scene especially i feel must point out as being a special scene on first viewing as a man is running through the forest from the creature he spots the expedition that has gone on looking for it raising his hands to <UNK> to them for help the second he goes to <UNK> his presence is he attacked from out of nowhere and killed quite <UNK> it caught me by surprise and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing br br the bad news there was only a couple things to complain about here and one is a usual complaint the creature here is mostly rendered by horrible cgi which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility it <UNK> had the air of menace <UNK> up by the opening of the film is almost shot out the window when the creature appears on screen it's so distracting that it's a shame a little more work wasn't put into it i've complained about this one a lot and is something that really should be done away with as it doesn't look that realistic and is quite fake another big one is the off screen kills in here very often in the film is a person grabbed and then <UNK> away and then finding the bloody body afterward it's quite <UNK> when the kills look nice and <UNK> afterward otherwise i don't really have much of a problem with this one as everything else that's usually <UNK> about this one didn't really bother me but it is called on for others beyond this stuff br br the final verdict i kinda liked this one but it's still not the best sasquatch movie ever it's not supposed to be taken seriously and if viewed that way it's actually <UNK> enjoyable fans of these films should give this one a look and those that like the sci fi creature features might find some nice things in here as well br br rated r graphic language violence and some graphic <UNK>

<START> this movie is really special it's a very beautiful movie which starts with three <UNK> sho his brother <UNK> and their friend <UNK> they're poor children's living on the street but one day they succeeded to steal a bag full of money and then their able to live on to buy a house and their life seems to become much better they're making new friend life friends but something went wrong and they're becoming enemies and it all ends up with them killing each other br br i was negative about this movie in the beginning because when singers gackt solo ex singer in <UNK> <UNK> hyde solo singer in <UNK> en <UNK> both very famous in japan and wang lee <UNK> <UNK> singer trying to become actors but this isn't like the other singers going actors movies they're doing a great job and with no earlier experience in movies except for lee <UNK> who had been in two movies before br br this is absolutely one of my favorite movies maybe that's a little because i'm a very big fan of hyde but it was this movie who made me discover him br br well gackt playing the main character the orphan sho was a part of the group who wrote the script and it was he who insisted that hyde should play <UNK> friend the vampire <UNK> at that time they didn't know each other at least not like friends but after the movie they became really good friend and that shows us too that they really worked hard on this movie and that they had good <UNK> br br the movie have many different feelings running <UNK> the story love hate sadness pain loneliness happiness and so on i think the first hour are the best it's so beautiful after that people are dying <UNK> leaving and it all changes so much but still it's a great movie it's the only movie who has ever made me cry it ends up so sad but still beautiful br br so if you haven't seen this movie you really should because it's wonderful but sad you won't regret it

<START> running only <UNK> two minutes this small overlooked 2006 <UNK> is really just a two character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations taking place almost entirely in various non <UNK> spots in southern los angeles the story itself is <UNK> but like <UNK> <UNK> lost in translation the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly find a common bond and go back to their lives <UNK> for the <UNK> encounter it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters finally freed of the wise <UNK> and authority figures beyond <UNK> that have become his big screen <UNK> freeman seems <UNK> <UNK> as a somewhat self indulgent movie star his character is driven to a low rent <UNK> store in carson where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film br br out of work for a few years he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin but his ego is such that he does not lack the <UNK> to watch and even <UNK> the <UNK> store staff of particular fascination to him is scarlet an <UNK> worker from spain and <UNK> to the express line where she is the <UNK> model of <UNK> she has an interview for a <UNK> job at a construction company but her deep <UNK> <UNK> seems to defeat her chances already still looking like penelope <UNK> <UNK> sister the beautiful vega one of the few <UNK> aspects of james l <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brings a <UNK> edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story which includes stops not only at the <UNK> store but also at target <UNK> and a full service <UNK> nothing earth shattering happens except to show how two people realize the <UNK> <UNK> of chance encounters br br <UNK> keeps the proceedings simple but the production also reflects expert <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> vibrant cinematography he <UNK> alexander <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> score by brazilian composer antonio <UNK> city of god there are fast cameos by bobby <UNK> as <UNK> soon to be ex husband and as themselves danny <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as a funny bits with <UNK> hill knocked up as the clueless driver and jim parsons the knight in garden state as a <UNK> <UNK> the 2007 dvd is <UNK> with extras including a making of documentary 15 days or less aimed at film students and running a marathon <UNK> minutes six extended scenes a light hearted but insightful three way conversation between <UNK> freeman and vega in the middle of target and a couple of snippets that specifically <UNK> the dvd
<START> this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are <UNK> <UNK> blood cells etc i will not try to explain it in more details you will simply have to see it for yourself you will not be disappointed br br i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s with swedish voices i have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also i must admit that the education part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of <UNK> children while they have fun is wonderful i have recently seen a few episodes there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays br br 5 5

<START> this movie while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by mgm and starring janet leigh is still a great film danny glover in one of his best performances brings george knox a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper to life as for this movie being <UNK> how about adding christopher lloyd his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen a wonderful actor joseph gordon <UNK> third rock from the sun brenda <UNK> a charming and well seasoned irish actress tony <UNK> yes even he is good in this film matthew <UNK> he stole the show in <UNK> and confused and his role may not be as pivotal in this film but he got exposure <UNK> <UNK> what i said about matthew <UNK> goes the same for <UNK> except the <UNK> and confused part some great character actors like taylor <UNK> david tony <UNK> <UNK> jay o sanders ranch wilder <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bass and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances ben johnson hank murphy the owner of the california angels and the rest of the cast does a great job plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone i don't care what <UNK> of depression you're in i loved this film as a kid and it brings back memories when i watch it today i need this on dvd i recommend it to any parent who's looking for something their kids have not seen and everybody else for that matter
<START> always <UNK> this film from the video cover eventually got round to buying it for a <UNK> in a sale and boy what a film a simply stunning performance from all of the case and it's filmed so beautifully even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale it's really moving frequently amusing and very watchable not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much <UNK> a 9 10 from me a must see
<START> what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has <UNK> down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba br br unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the <UNK> within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer not even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new <UNK> were <UNK> the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she <UNK> couldn't sleep br br the moral of the story the one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with it br br <UNK>
<START> one the whole this movie isn't perfect it doesn't <UNK> <UNK> together as the story line is basically a bunch of <UNK> to hang jokes br br some of these jokes are a little <UNK> <UNK> and tend to date the picture br br but some of these jokes are classic br br you know a movie has something special when you and your friends still reference silly quotes from it over 2 decades later br br plus there are a bunch of familiar faces michael keaton danny <UNK> joe <UNK> peter boyle <UNK> <UNK> maureen <UNK> bob <UNK> <UNK> dunne and one of the last roles of alan hale jr the <UNK> from <UNK> island br br also there are some great <UNK> moments like when johnny is <UNK> the <UNK> with a <UNK> gun or the <UNK> making an appearance in <UNK> neighborhood also the scene where the fake priest makes up a lot of words in latin is excellent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> too <UNK> post <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uncle <UNK> br br other classic scenes include <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the english language danny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dunne to <UNK> <UNK> peter boyle thinking he lost his <UNK> the fake <UNK> movie br br this movie is no home run but like <UNK> it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable
<START> whilst i have loved haunted house movies such as <UNK> and <UNK> this made for tv adaption of susan hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of hollywood br br with a brilliant cast many of which star in <UNK> and other tv dramas great acting and fantastic setting which portrays <UNK> life convincingly it has all the right ingredients to <UNK> the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story br br herbert wise did not need blood violence or gore to send chills down the <UNK> of an audience using your own imagination the woman in black is a figure of fear and dread and whose presence is never absent once she first appears br br the main character arthur <UNK> a <UNK> learns about his unseen <UNK> on his mission to settle the estate the widow dies and arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many <UNK> which may haunt him for some days some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic particularly the locked room which opens itself which turns the <UNK> off and <UNK> arthur in darkness the film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in <UNK> shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost off the writer puts many chilling <UNK> into the story an example being the tin <UNK> re appearance one is eager to learn the meaning of it all the fact we never really learn that much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling br br the widow for the most part looks vicious and <UNK> the scene after <UNK> the <UNK> sent the chills down me a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated <UNK> land with a howling wind ¬ñ having been on such <UNK> myself i can appreciate how <UNK> this is and the scene in the <UNK> was perhaps the most horrible things i've seen one i don't wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives i have often <UNK> up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep br br the woman in black is a great tv movie and a lost gem i agree to some extent the internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of <UNK> on it but i think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over exposed i think it's still brilliant and fantastically acted and i consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century
<START> this modern film noir with its off beat humour and <UNK> succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish it's impossible not to <UNK> with the honest <UNK> hero or to be <UNK> by the ways in which he tries to <UNK> his way out of the terrible <UNK> that he finds himself in so all you can do is <UNK> your seat belt and enjoy the ride br br the story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the <UNK> <UNK> him into an <UNK> sequence of events from which he is unable to <UNK> himself is pure film noir the same is true of the themes of murder <UNK> corruption and <UNK> which are <UNK> throughout many of the familiar noir visual <UNK> are also present such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit the rain <UNK> roads at night the heavily <UNK> interiors and the lines of shadow created by <UNK> doors across people's faces br br michael williams nicolas cage an injured war veteran without money or a job stops off at a bar in red rock <UNK> and is mistaken by the <UNK> wayne brown j t walsh for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife suzanne lara flynn boyle michael a naturally <UNK> person does nothing to <UNK> wayne of his <UNK> especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do after having been told what his mission is and been given a 5 000 advance he goes to see suzanne and warns her about wayne's plan she doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers michael double the <UNK> wayne had offered for him to eliminate her husband br br michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town his plan fails however when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his <UNK> at the hospital things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is <UNK> lover and he has two bullets in his stomach this leads to the local law <UNK> officers getting involved and the revelation that wayne is the sheriff from this point on things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man <UNK> from dallas dennis hopper arrives on the scene br br red rock west has some great moments of suspense an example of this is the scene in which michael makes his escape from wayne's bar and also some great performances from its very strong cast nicolas <UNK> expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he <UNK> to a variety of situations with anxiety surprise or <UNK> and j t walsh is also particularly good as a <UNK> character who's always <UNK> more than he's actually saying dennis hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer a role he plays with great gusto and lara flynn boyle looks suitably cold and <UNK> as the femme fatale dwight <UNK> also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver br br incredibly red rock west was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has <UNK> emerged from its modest <UNK> to eventually be <UNK> as the great movie that it really is
<START> well on it's credit side if it can be said to have one timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g <UNK> outstanding <UNK> but other than that well to call a spade a spade it sucks <UNK> what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged 20 million dollar budget timothy hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed genius anyway look like the best filmmaker of all time the special effects i guess you'd call them that are not even up to computer game standards the acting is well perhaps about dinner theater comparable and the accents are atrocious at the risk of sounding offensive a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is especially poor <UNK> well <UNK> gay poor <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about the bogus english countryside waving his <UNK> white <UNK> about as if it were heat <UNK> armor hey the <UNK> in star wars had neat white body armor too and it didn't work either they still got <UNK> even when <UNK> and company get fried by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they <UNK> and <UNK> in some weird kind of dance even when they're <UNK> dead and reduced to <UNK> which <UNK> in <UNK> dancing and <UNK> maybe timothy hines rented the <UNK> from ray <UNK> being left over from jason and the <UNK> or was it <UNK> and the <UNK> i <UNK> the soldiers presumably because they're <UNK> all seem to just rather <UNK> explode like the soldier on <UNK> and his unfortunate <UNK> carrying the <UNK> just beyond him wow i loved it but the <UNK> all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war or <UNK> <UNK> which would be more or less correct for the period perhaps that was some bit of <UNK> subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines oddly enough the character of the <UNK> looks exactly like he's drawn in the original <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting oh yeah <UNK> forget the thunder child in the book the <UNK> is described as an <UNK> <UNK> ram it was meant to ram enemy ships yet it's bow was <UNK> after <UNK> the <UNK> toy constructed martian war machines with a tiny <UNK> hole in the <UNK> and she <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> could've <UNK> the titanic and survived but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest <UNK> constraints as our own military the costumes are all wrong especially the british army and police uniforms <UNK> together mostly from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in an obvious homage to western films of <UNK> has obviously set his movie in wild western england because all his riders are using western <UNK> the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish <UNK> accent used by clan macabre and magically delicious irish accents from county <UNK> on the credit side and contrary to what one reviewer wrote the only genuine authentic feature of this thing is the <UNK> the guns are not from the civil war but appear to my eye and research as <UNK> <UNK> british nine or 12 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perfectly authentic to the period so was the <UNK> shown being used but the <UNK> who is a driver in the horse <UNK> was not shown correctly driving his <UNK> you don't sit on the <UNK> <UNK> box and drive a gun team you ride the <UNK> wheel horses the opening using what i believe is authentic period film footage is okay and the <UNK> not bad however to the best of my knowledge <UNK> has never had an underground and it certainly didn't in <UNK> br br but growing up reading this novel i am very disappointed even more disappointed then i was at spielberg's <UNK> dollar special effects laden version maybe his version would have <UNK> by <UNK> anthony <UNK> for tom cruise and vice versa i have a lot more to say but i'll let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds that's faithful to the original <UNK> vision is fine for a high school film class or maybe i should say <UNK> stupid for a college level film student and about as bad which is about the best i can say for this thing but that's about it oh yeah just where did the budget go and what happened to michael caine i'd like to hear his comments i have a <UNK> suspicion that <UNK> orson wood <UNK> breathtaking bound breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk taking director's ticket to cult stardom because i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie which i didn't pay for anyway but was <UNK> sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me with no <UNK> intent that i've been able to determine i must add here that i thought <UNK> dubbed and <UNK> version was not only a vast improvement but an absolute hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch i find it hard to watch master <UNK> version after <UNK> keep it up tim make your own version of <UNK> now it just <UNK> the hand of a master like you and all you <UNK> <UNK> who hated <UNK> forget it it cannot beat <UNK> hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness hey get a life <UNK> is worse than the master ed wood i kid you not
<START> less than 10 minutes into this film i wanted it to end as it was painful all this horror movie was about was a group of whiny <UNK> doing stupid things for 90 minutes arguing crying and screaming do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really shouldn't watch it br br the movies plot had potential to be something great but it just doesn't happen a group of five teenage girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them two minutes into the movie and the characters are already arguing and this doesn't stop all we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining crying screaming acting and arguing none of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too so you don't get to really know these characters or enjoy them br br the acting was terrible and i was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers none of these women looked a day under 20 and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old at least get people who look the age none of them gave even remotely decent performances and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities the actress who played the killer overdone it but she at least showed something that the other girls didn't a little bit of talent br br the characters don't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny stupid <UNK> that is all i can really say about them and it did not help that they all survived if i have to go into detail in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot one girl <UNK> herself and is whining about it four of them aren't wearing seat <UNK> what do you expect one of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer and you all just happen to be conveniently too hurt to help whatever br br the filming of the movie is absolutely terrible i don't care if this movie had a budget the size of a <UNK> the filming was terrible and it was like watching a <UNK> version of a movie the cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera <UNK> out <UNK> and <UNK> up against an actress was horrendous it was also grainy and at times you couldn't hear what characters were saying not that it was anything worth listening to br br supposedly the killers car in the movie that supposedly got hit even though we only heard the accident is actually the directors car in real life no wonder they didn't show the car getting hit this movie is so cheap they can't even show a car getting a little <UNK> up oh gotta mention the soundtrack also if that's what it was it was horrid sad one second then hard rock the next br br at the end of the day five across the eyes just feels like a terrible home movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes it doesn't help when the script is terrible the scares tension suspense and hardly even any gore to make up for it are absent the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous br br this was a horrible low budget movie avoid it at all costs br br 1 10
<START> br br get your <UNK> out and enjoy this flawed action flick <UNK> considerable <UNK> skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isn't half bad just executed pretty poorly but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts you're missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in <UNK> way way too few korean actors even extras
<START> if you have ever seen a movie by brian <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it to the <UNK> it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are <UNK> trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their <UNK> themselves sometimes they even admit it but that's not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie that's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones br br the movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me later br br brian <UNK> <UNK> might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still <UNK> his movies okay they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
<START> when the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the blockbuster but honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which <UNK> a loser the movie has a tag line <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which means <UNK> sweet but sacrifice is immortal in the movie the hero of the movie <UNK> sacrifices his love for the leading lady <UNK> gandhi even though the two loved each other his justification is the meaning of the tag line this movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this loser like <UNK> attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is when they could have moved on with their lives <UNK> acting in the movie is amateurish crass and <UNK> stupid he actually looks funny in a song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when he's supposed to look all stylish and cool his looks don't help the leading role either his hair style is badly done in most part of the movie <UNK> gandhi cant act her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent br br the good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by <UNK> <UNK> which are actually the true saving <UNK> of the movie also the lyrics by <UNK> <UNK> are very well penned the director <UNK> <UNK> has to be <UNK> <UNK> the songs in a <UNK> manner br br anyway all in all except for the songs the movie is a very ordinary one
<START> this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't very funny and had a drama element where bill the mother was struggling with all the usual problems in life but that element was a bit depressing and didn't mix well with <UNK> comedy elements which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the bbc have ever made the chemistry between bill and ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmas <UNK> were hilarious and a real treat for christmas br br the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such as up <UNK> under and a very funny man rip br br this underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn't to be repeated that often though it does appear on <UNK> gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
<START> saw this piece of work at a film fest in <UNK> my god what was the director thinking film <UNK> should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film first off this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the film takes place partially in the <UNK> some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere where nothing really takes place br br the acting is beyond bad so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films there is one or two decent performances including the guys who played <UNK> and <UNK> but it's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his <UNK> the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue which <UNK> on absurd the writer whom i assume is also the director writes each character like they are <UNK> for a comic book villain br br the overall production value is pretty good but to be honest with a film this bad it's easy to overlook it the production design is pretty good although the <UNK> looks like any ordinary bar the costumes and make up are okay and i understand the production was working with a low budget it's just when the characters speak or they try and push the plot forward the film <UNK> into a <UNK> of crap br br as i've said this film is god awful it's like the director writer watched a lot of sci fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a <UNK> and came up with this my only hope is that he used other people's money on this because if he used his own he's a total sucker
<START> this movie is based on the art of frank <UNK> the mythical fantasy <UNK> some of the characters are straight out of his paintings the death dealer being the best example surprisingly the animation manages to keep the feeling of the original art bakshi is well known for his heavy use of <UNK> the technique of <UNK> a live action sequence and this film is no exception however since the subject of the movie is quite realistic all characters are humans this works pretty well br br but what i really like here is the plot for once we have a story with interesting characters and nice action sequences a really hideous villain and a gorgeous babe this movie has the feeling of the best conan comics not surprisingly since roy thomas is the writer of the marvel series of our favourite <UNK> this is a far cry from the crappy live action conan not to speak of all the b movie of the genre br br definitely recommended
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching <UNK> stink <UNK> heroes run <UNK> through the bush with an egg on a <UNK> for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows <UNK> which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for <UNK> bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are <UNK> in an air <UNK> make shift bio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy <UNK> people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true <UNK> they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette <UNK> from a <UNK> of garbage <UNK> eventually striking pay dirt and <UNK> a <UNK> dr frankenstein <UNK> cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of <UNK> <UNK> on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are <UNK> sent <UNK> to the local institution when the frightening <UNK> state of full blown <UNK> kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> i had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations in fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times unlike other meyer films the sexual antics are down to a minimum some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive the plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful br br the film is a strange combination of <UNK> <UNK> fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and <UNK> of the slavery and fails on all counts it's as though meyer was trying to make up for the <UNK> <UNK> by having a higher moral message meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant <UNK> <UNK> of the early scene showing lady susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit he then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil however because they <UNK> each other out you end up with nothing br br because it so bad in so many ways it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste perhaps because it is so bad we almost let meyer get away with the <UNK>
<START> cheech <UNK> next movie 1980 was the second film to star to pot loving duo of cheech <UNK> and tommy chong the lovable burn out <UNK> are now roommates they live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day but cheech is the responsible one he has a job and a steady girlfriend one day cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get chong out of the house another problem <UNK> as well <UNK> brother red cheech is another role is in town and wants to hang with him <UNK> that he could kill two birds with one stone cheech <UNK> chong off and red what kind of adventures will chong and red get into will cheech get his freak on how long will chong go without some smoke just watch cheech <UNK> next movie to find out br br tommy chong takes over the directorial <UNK> for the sequel he received some experience when he did some uncredited work on up in smoke funny but not as good as the first film but cheech and chong fans will enjoy it followed by nice dreams br br recommended
<START> dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result violent sexy <UNK> at his most home made little better than a home movie as much of <UNK> films are this is a trip into <UNK> 1960's style notable for the <UNK> nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome playing now more as quaint though decidedly r rated the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the <UNK> of the production no one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a <UNK> <UNK> or because its got some good looking people <UNK> around
<START> some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with <UNK> pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such <UNK> suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution
<START> <UNK> <UNK> comedy drama <UNK> portrays some women trying to enter a <UNK> sports <UNK> from which women are banned the official reason lots of foul language and the soccer players have their legs showing but of course it's really a case of <UNK> so most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men br br as i understand all of <UNK> <UNK> movies this one included are banned in iran the real tragedy is that the <UNK> 1953 <UNK> of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave <UNK> <UNK> an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the <UNK> to establish a <UNK> society and that george w <UNK> current policy towards iran gives <UNK> <UNK> an excuse to act the cowboy and <UNK> censorship br br above all this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system not a great movie but worth seeing considering that all <UNK> <UNK> movies are banned i wonder how he's able to even make them
<START> this is one the few movies i can watch over and over if you've never seen it give it a shot richard <UNK> and <UNK> julia are wonderful together and although the movie <UNK> me greatly it reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> demise it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear
<START> br br i watched this movie just a little while ago and i found that this movie was terrible it moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining br br sorry for all those that liked it this is only my opinion
<START> i am actually <UNK> at the comment i read stating that this movie was boring and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage it was made in <UNK> i think it absolutely incredible for it's time br br the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable it took them a week just to cross a river the women carried their children in heavy wooden <UNK> on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock sometimes <UNK> in the snow i would like to see anybody do that now br br i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story
<START> i realize that alot of people hate this movie but i must admit that it is one of my favorites i happen to like it better then its <UNK> and happy to like it better than alot of movies br br first off i think that people never give the story any credit much like back to the future time travel is hard to write and in this movie they included time travel and a spiritual journey br br i also feel that keanu and alex were on there best performances in this movie they looked <UNK> acted <UNK> and said <UNK> things br br the set design of this movie is <UNK> as well the sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage <UNK> who can hardly spell but <UNK> that the genius of the whole franchise making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire <UNK> future of earth br br the costume design was <UNK> as well bill and ted actually look cool in bogus journey where as in excellent adventure they look rather like well as they would put it <UNK> br br even the music in this movie is <UNK> the score especially there so much i could say about this film cause i love it but this is one of those movies i grew up watching and <UNK> i did i liked it more so i can understand why people hate or just think its bogus compared to excellent adventure which i also love by the way br br get down with your bad self
<START> after hearing about george <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece for all of my life i'm now <UNK> but never having read the book i am totally confused as to what i've just seen br br i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as i'm sure most are but only through <UNK> and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery and even with it i'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than i was before i watched it br br on the plus side br br the cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making br br now for the down sides and there are plenty br br there is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are a couple of names <UNK> about <UNK> etc but they mean nothing without explanation br br who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isn't he on the front line why doesn't he eat the food in the <UNK> what is that drink he's drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why isn't he <UNK> like the rest of them what's the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father a little back story would have been nice no <UNK> that essential for those like myself that haven't read the book without it this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on br br the soundtrack was <UNK> <UNK> and badly edited and the constant <UNK> from the big brother screens <UNK> the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same br br also i know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage br br i personally can't <UNK> the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all <UNK> <UNK> but this is a few steps too far the other way i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the <UNK> <UNK> that i've seen many people say i would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is <UNK> as the classic it is br br there's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci fi <UNK> have done the same without leaving <UNK> holes in the storyline br br i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this br br all in all very disappointed in something i've waited for years to watch
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the funniest film i've seen in ages akshay kumar is excellent as the <UNK> who has affairs with 3 girls and engaged at the same time john abraham is amusing at times and this is one of his best works so far <UNK> <UNK> is superb as usual in most of his films the director <UNK> has delivered great movies in the past <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> being some of the best <UNK> <UNK> is his funniest film he has made the three newcomer actresses are average <UNK> <UNK> doesn't get much scope in this movie i was impressed to see how <UNK> made a movie with a simple storyline of a guy having a affair with 3 girls at the same time all 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house packed with loads of laughs this is one non stop entertainer
<START> a double life has developed a <UNK> among film fans for two reasons the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role here othello as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life and that this is the film that won ronald colman the academy award as well as the golden globe as best actor let's take the second point first br br is anthony john <UNK> greatest role or even his signature role i have my doubts on either level but it is among his best known roles most of his career ronald colman played decent gentlemen frequently in dangerous or <UNK> situations he is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up in the <UNK> production not to be an arrogant racist fighting crime he is <UNK> the great <UNK> player and even greater <UNK> trying to pull off his best <UNK> to save a friend's honor he is robert <UNK> the great <UNK> political figure who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth <UNK> la he is dick <UNK> <UNK> going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist i can add sidney <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to this list but here he is not heroic in fact he is <UNK> villainous he murders one person and nearly kills two others it does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill his behavior here is anti social br br to me colman should have gotten the oscar for <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> all more typical of his acting roles but the academy has a long tradition of picking <UNK> roles for <UNK> it's treasure to it's leading members <UNK> anthony john is a very good performance and at one point truly scary when alone with <UNK> <UNK> in her home she at the top of a <UNK> and him at the base they have an argument she demands that tony leave saying she won't see him he stares at her his face oddly <UNK> in a way he never used before and he says oh no you won't he starts moving upstairs frightening <UNK> and she runs into her room he stops himself and leaves it actually is the real <UNK> of his performance even more than his <UNK> of <UNK> on stage or of <UNK> o'brien or his killing of shelley winters it showed his blind fury for that moment it was to me an oscar worthy performance but it is only that moment i'm glad he was recognized for the role but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance br br his actual performance in the <UNK> role of othello is not great but bearable too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style one wonders if that was due to the <UNK> of walter <UNK> who probably knew how to handle the role properly or a reaction to it nowadays othello is played by an african american actor more frequently than a white one paul <UNK> brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place but the three best known movie performances of the part are those of colman orson welles in his movie of othello and laurence olivier in his movie of his play production of othello all three white actors did the role in black face my personal favorite of the three is welles who seems the most subtle but even watching welles' fine film version makes me angry that <UNK> never got to put his performance with jose <UNK> as <UNK> on film br br now the first question can an actor get that wrapped up in a role i heard different things about this some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set others have found a role they have to be stimulating <UNK> them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life but actually i have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role it seems a melodramatic hackneyed idea br br as a matter of fact it was not a new idea in <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and gordon in 1944 a b feature the <UNK> <UNK> starring john <UNK> had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous jack the <UNK> type and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind there was an earlier movie in the 1930s in which an actor playing othello gets jealous of his wife i think the title was men are not gods but i'm not sure but due to <UNK> name and career and <UNK> directing it is a double life that people think of when they recall this plot idea it even reached comedy finally on an episode of cheers where diane <UNK> is helping an ex convict who may have acting talent and they put on othello at the bar just after he sees her with sam malone kissing only diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex convict and can't <UNK> the production long enough she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play br br the cast of a double life was first rate and <UNK> direction was as sure as ever so the film is definitely worth watching but despite giving colman an interestingly different role it was not his best work on the screen
<START> even by 1942 standards of movie making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme the <UNK> of one half of a pair of husband wife ex husband ex wife to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another divorce or an eventual <UNK> by means of jealousy <UNK> or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story both of these movies features women with a strong <UNK> screen presence and who played independent <UNK> feminist characters in both movies both women were estranged divorced from their witty first husbands and set to marry <UNK> men who were their exact opposite and both would be <UNK> into <UNK> their soon to be husbands and re <UNK> their passion for each other br br the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender here it's norma <UNK> in the cary grant role out this time to ward off an ex boyfriend george sanders by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her <UNK> the problem is <UNK> is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid to late <UNK> sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most any man who would be in love with his fianc√©e on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene not here and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time not in speech <UNK> but in overall essence br br but the worst part of it is <UNK> herself for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual <UNK> and dramatic presence playing <UNK> <UNK> seems to put her into <UNK> of complete over acting over <UNK> and over <UNK> which while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry <UNK> it only <UNK> the fires that tell the theory which gives irving <UNK> the maker of her career and <UNK> of most of her roles why she passed on roles such as charlotte <UNK> and mrs <UNK> on mega hits now voyager and mrs <UNK> is a mystery but then again most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting that she'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and can't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible such could be the case here she seems lost she seems tired she seems ill at ease going through <UNK> instead of living the part after this film she would make no more but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s
<START> i'll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this <UNK> <UNK> is about a guy who drugs a girl's drink <UNK> and <UNK> her then poses as a captive to have sex with her that is the single twist and punchline of the film it's torture as slow motion date rape and it's not even a good movie it's not so bad it's good it's just bad br br it should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile why no one had the <UNK> to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond me br br don't give your money to these <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the premise of this <UNK> sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake i expected a lot sincerely br br the sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept the situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful br br this time there aren't likable characters or <UNK> unlike the remake also the gore is not that <UNK> and when it happens it's truly bad br br the violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence i mean there's a <UNK> team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants you surely expect something different when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money back br br anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects br br a mess that let down the fans of the remake like me that's why sequels are never welcomed at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original
<START> the five deadly <UNK> is easily the most memorable k f flick from the shaw <UNK> stable <UNK> maybe master killer it has the artists who came to be known as simply the <UNK> some of the best fight choreography ever and surprisingly for a kung fu movie a great plot one of my all time favorites
<START> i read tom <UNK> even <UNK> get the blues as a teenager i loved every word it was sexy funny and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing but when i saw the movie i could not believe what a dull sour <UNK> piece of junk it was how did this happen i think someone in hollywood read this book and <UNK> it under gay pride women lesbians that's the library of <UNK> subject heading now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians any more than star wars is about real space travel the book was obviously and i do mean obviously written by a <UNK> male who loves the idea of lesbians in the nude all the time but has never really met one br br still someone in hollywood said uh oh better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble so they handed it to gus van <UNK> nothing against the man but however gay he may really be he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film gus van <UNK> took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt free girl girl action and male <UNK> turned it into a dull literal minded lesbian power <UNK> poster it's like turning an oscar <UNK> comedy into an arthur miller tragedy not pretty br br the main clue that gus van <UNK> had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the <UNK> bad casting his <UNK> allowed him to hire the very best his ignorance of the <UNK> real subtext a straight man's fantasy not a gay pride <UNK> poster caused him to make choices that were not only bad but bizarre br br let's meet the cast of even <UNK> get the blues br br pat <UNK> as the <UNK> okay there are few name recognition asian actors and pat <UNK> in happy days was fairly funny but casting him as the <UNK> was wrong wrong wrong pat <UNK> has no idea that the <UNK> is a very funny man gus didn't tell him pat also doesn't seem to know that the <UNK> is well sexy in the book he's not wise old mr <UNK> he's more like hugh <UNK> he's a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the <UNK> and <UNK> sissy and bonanza <UNK> you see in the book they aren't really lesbians do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet br br john hurt as the <UNK> okay he's a gay friendly man but he is a serious shakespearean actor you need someone who is fun and camp for this role for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the <UNK> is tragic and sad i kept expecting paul <UNK> to wander in all dressed up as thomas more and sadly shake his head now richard you know you've lost your soul entirely for shame my former student and yes john hurt was funny and pretty gay as <UNK> but that was black humor not playful and <UNK> humor like the book br br rain phoenix as bonanza <UNK> no talent no training no problem except that in the book bonanza is funny playful cheerful mostly <UNK> and loving in the movie she's <UNK> passive <UNK> and dull as for her taste for women robbins in the book puts it like this god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits uh gus did you read this book br br uma thurman as sissy <UNK> this is a tough role in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and <UNK> heroine still a more accomplished actress might have <UNK> a <UNK> in her eye or a <UNK> in her walk to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures uma doesn't pull it off probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a <UNK> <UNK> with a beautiful body and giant thumbs uma plays it more like she's in a tv movie about a girl dying of <UNK> br br this movie is sour and dull and i <UNK> you gus van <UNK>
<START> the minute the forward started i knew we were in for trouble the premise is laughable at best the story line was even worse if that is possible br br the acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of <UNK> you expect more from the likes of slater reid and <UNK> lines were delivered as if from a robot and i'm sorry i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an <UNK> slater and <UNK> picked a lousy film to try and stage their <UNK> br br the continuity was off through out the entire film the creatures weren't bad but they really weren't good either br br bottom line i want that ninety minutes of my life back they can keep the money but give me the time what a waste
<START> douglas sirk directs this over acted drama about the unhappy <UNK> kyle hadley robert stack and mitch wayne rock hudson are <UNK> friends with different looks on life kyle is the <UNK> son of an oil <UNK> mitch works for the hadley oil company both fall in love with the same woman lucy moore but it is kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her sister <UNK> dorothy malone seems to be the town's <UNK> and carrying a torch for mitch who always seems to be the one to clean up the <UNK> <UNK> ambitious with <UNK> a little over the top but the stars make it a movie to see i was most impressed with malone <UNK> out the cast robert keith edward <UNK> john <UNK> and robert j <UNK>
<START> <UNK> wow the genius who brought us <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> takes on the challenge of making a 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old <UNK> inter titles was a nice touch then the camera <UNK> opens like the old hand <UNK> on a black white <UNK> the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party this is all in the first 60 seconds br br then the music starts a rather banal and forgettable <UNK> featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls <UNK> some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes i speak french so i can't blame it on the subtitles those characters <UNK> out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey <UNK> appears and we hear our first <UNK> dialogue 15 minutes into the film br br i'm not sure what <UNK> intended by starting off with such a <UNK> waste of time musical <UNK> but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to <UNK> <UNK> at the screen and storm out i endured br br it didn't get much better i'll tell you why there is absolutely no <UNK> with any of the characters we don't even see their faces half the time as <UNK> seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people <UNK> on off stage like <UNK> around a <UNK> and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it's as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and <UNK> it into a 2 hour movie with bad songs br br the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did 1 hour was that i was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all i admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours not me maybe tomorrow i'll try watching the end <UNK> who am i kidding i have more important things to do i'm sure you do too skip this
<START> i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read it does not do justice to this incredible movie for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child my sister and i couldn't wait until every april when we could see it on t v it is one of the best horse movies of it's time it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch the romance is clean and endearing the story line is interesting and the songs are great they don't make movies like this anymore good acting and not over the top pat <UNK> and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
<START> perhaps i couldn't find the dvd menu selection for plot on off clearly the <UNK> is off when the end credits began to roll i couldn't believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty cheap br br the characters were drawn in very broad <UNK> and the writer's disdain for wealthy <UNK> was all to apparent i consider myself a <UNK> <UNK> but would appreciate a bit more subtlety br br of course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i br br the only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was the nice scenery human and plant
<START> this <UNK> of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a <UNK> license it quickly becomes <UNK> with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars br br such things as <UNK> <UNK> drag racing <UNK> paint jobs and car shows are discussed it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times none of the people in the film are actually heard instead everything is done in narration and <UNK> sorry but i can't stand that br br there is nothing educational or interesting about dad can i borrow the car it's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their wonderful world of disney tv show 1 10
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed <UNK> graphic novel when it came out and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film and even more so when i found that <UNK> had directed it himself the film however was a major letdown the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty <UNK> of the original <UNK> and the story is poorly told <UNK> seems to have chosen to focus on the more <UNK> aspects of the graphic novel and he doesn't do a very good job at it either br br the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship hate relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> they were both out of their right time and place forced together by <UNK> most of all they were funny and likable not so here <UNK> has no discernible personality whatsoever and <UNK> is a pompous <UNK> who just wants to get laid even though the film is french <UNK> doesn't have to be br br we have all seen films we enjoyed but wouldn't recommend to everyone for some reason or other i wouldn't recommend <UNK> to anyone except maybe as a warning not to <UNK> your talent and resources <UNK> a master <UNK> but obviously not a master of every visual medium
<START> some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this <UNK> is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one br br the movie mainly told us about the inside of two <UNK> who definitely had different personalities and different experiences <UNK> <UNK> who was a veteran and had <UNK> confirmed kills looked as if he was cold hearted however after <UNK> showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his <UNK> inside it was the cruel war and his <UNK> sacrifice that made <UNK> become so called cold hearted br br <UNK> on the contrary was a new <UNK> a green hand and was even not <UNK> as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show <UNK> <UNK> and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through one's heart as what <UNK> said what he thought about the <UNK> suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award br br these two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two <UNK> <UNK> suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other br br sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one
<START> wwe was in need of a <UNK> as <UNK> 14 rolled around the departure of <UNK> hart and subsequent <UNK> of the hart foundation had left the vile d generation x stable <UNK> in the wwe their despicable leader shawn michaels had stolen the title from hart thanks to the <UNK> of vince <UNK> and with help from his <UNK> triple h and <UNK> had <UNK> taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy but at the royal <UNK> a new <UNK> had emerged stone cold steve austin hated by <UNK> austin had <UNK> worried so worried in fact that they'd <UNK> the help of the <UNK> man on the planet mike <UNK> as a special <UNK> austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with shawn michaels br br but first there was an <UNK> to get through which kicked off with the legion of doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle royal to become no 1 <UNK> for the tag titles i'd actually forgotten this match existed until i <UNK> the <UNK> no very good and really <UNK> the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time br br next match saw the light <UNK> title <UNK> by champion <UNK> <UNK> against <UNK> the wwe had established the light <UNK> title to compete with the strong <UNK> division in <UNK> it was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever <UNK> at <UNK> short match going about five minutes and in fact too short for much to be achieved what little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw <UNK> <UNK> his title br br ok our next match saw <UNK> member triple h defending the wwe european title which he'd won in <UNK> fashion from shawn michaels on raw in december and hadn't <UNK> on <UNK> against owen hart the sole survivor triple h got a big entrance with the <UNK> band there to perform his theme song <UNK> accompanied triple h to <UNK> but was then <UNK> to wwe <UNK> sgt slaughter triple h and owen have a nice little match before <UNK> <UNK> causing a low blow on hart which leads to triple h <UNK> the title good match could have been great had it gone slightly longer br br but of course we wouldn't want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife marc <UNK> and <UNK> defeat <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the first mixed tag match at <UNK> in 8 years and in all honesty it wasn't worth the wait while not terrible the match was in no way memorable either this was the <UNK> the end of <UNK> only run in the wwe and the main purpose was to continue the <UNK> of his relationship with <UNK> br br next up we saw ken <UNK> flip out and cost himself the <UNK> championship as he destroyed <UNK> champion the rock but then refused to let go of his <UNK> lock <UNK> hold resulting in the <UNK> <UNK> his decision this was a short match but decent for what it was br br next saw the first good match of the night as wwe tag team <UNK> the new age <UNK> lost their titles to <UNK> jack and chainsaw charlie in a fun <UNK> match the decision was <UNK> the following night as <UNK> and chainsaw had thrown the <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> rather than the one being used in the match but this was still a fun match br br now it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between kane and his brother the undertaker kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal <UNK> and then killed him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a <UNK> and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly <UNK> years before this was a decent match and told a nice story as the <UNK> absorbed everything kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three <UNK> to end the match br br this left only the main event which saw wwe champion face steve austin with mike <UNK> as the guest <UNK> michaels had suffered a <UNK> back injury in his match with the undertaker at the royal <UNK> and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations triple h and <UNK> were <UNK> to the back in the early going after <UNK> from the outside the match ended with austin <UNK> an attempt at sweet <UNK> music and hitting the stone cold <UNK> with the <UNK> down <UNK> then came into the ring to count the three celebrating the win with austin and then knocking out michaels after the match it turned out <UNK> and austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along br br that was the final <UNK> match for shawn michaels for four and a half years it helped establish austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by <UNK> appearance proved a crucial turning point in the <UNK> battle with <UNK> austin would go on to become the biggest star in wwe history and along with the rock mick <UNK> the undertaker and triple h lead the wwe through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance and it all started here at <UNK> 14
<START> jameson parker and marilyn <UNK> are the <UNK> most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily <UNK> larry <UNK> direction <UNK> <UNK> between black farce and roman tragedy robert <UNK> certainly think it's the former and his self centered performance in a minor role <UNK> the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don't like to let myself get so <UNK> but the bell jar is one of my all time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
<START> i couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned <UNK> br br barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired content wise he can produce eye candy and i like candy but its <UNK> and fundamental artistic <UNK> just <UNK> all the joy br br i am afraid that many people don't <UNK> between similar but really only on the surface works of <UNK> or even more linear film makers like <UNK> or kubrick i love 2001 odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes that kind of art as m <UNK> makes adds confusion and <UNK> off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema typical empty post modern <UNK> art and check his interviews i just don't buy it sorry and so boring br br i was never bored seeing <UNK> <UNK> movies while drawing restraint 9 was an utter disappointment especially while it offered the possibilities to be something to actually tell something in a non linear <UNK> way like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and <UNK> for the ship to <UNK> out ships meeting on the sea ideas of <UNK> as an object of value if it was <UNK> those pearl <UNK> everything could <UNK> a great surreal movie with some content but it didn't and those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony how vain and fake and <UNK> pretentious but empty can it get br br i has some great <UNK> scenes but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick br br and it doesn't have good <UNK> i like slow pace movies but this was just boring in some scenes because it was pretentious and fake so i was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity br br that kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view br br i want more <UNK>
<START> it was the tag line in the tradition of american pie that fooled me into renting this movie what i got was a piece of junk in the style of jackass with the major difference that compared to this jackass the movie seems like a citizen kane br br this movie made me regret that i rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10 because now i can't go beneath that this one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic <UNK> br br i actually turned it off after 45 minutes and that's something i very rarely do but it was just too plain boring stupid uninteresting and unnecessary br br can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10 what did your parents do drop you on the head when you were just a child or was it the very first movie you ever saw so you got nothing to compare it to are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off something must be wrong at least br br my advice stay clear of this one even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking choose something else or you'll regret it for sure
<START> marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in <UNK> davies plays a <UNK> from <UNK> georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father <UNK> henderson the <UNK> they arrive in is a hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands a job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets a job at a more <UNK> studio high art studios and lands a job in <UNK> period pieces a handsome but fake actor andre <UNK> shows her the <UNK> of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies <UNK> her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of a serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king <UNK> this is a silent film with a few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own a treasure of a film
<START> this is is a thoroughly unpleasant if <UNK> made movie i tried it because it stars richard <UNK> and jeff goldblum two good actors and because the plot line a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution sounded promising the movie is billed as a comedy sorta what we have is an endless series of shots you should <UNK> the pun of people in <UNK> lit and elegant if somewhat surreal interiors shooting each other in the head stomach <UNK> foot heart no part of the <UNK> is avoided it seems while <UNK> vague and <UNK> dialogue some of which is supposed evidently to be humorous in a sort of post modern way <UNK> dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a <UNK> card and he wears a single facial expression a <UNK> grin throughout ellen <UNK> and gregory hines do the best they can burt reynolds does a cameo the credits list rob <UNK> and joey bishop but i somehow missed them good move on their part the whole thing is cold <UNK> mechanical and <UNK> an heir i suspect to the style of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> born <UNK> if you liked those you'll probably like this
<START> last night i decided to watch the prequel or shall i say the so called prequel to carlito's way carlito's way rise to power 2005 which went straight to dvd no wonder it completely and i mean completely s <UNK> <UNK> of time watching it and i think it would be a pure <UNK> of time writing about it i don't understand how de palma agreed on producing this sh t fest of a movie except for only one fact that i tip my hat to jay <UNK> who plays the young <UNK> reminded me how de niro got into the shoes of brando to portray the young don <UNK> in godfather ii but the difference de niro was amazing and even got an oscar for it jay <UNK> well he has guts for trying to be a young pacino too bad for him i don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after i watched this sh <UNK> movie i sat down and watched the original <UNK> way to get the bad taste out of my mouth
<START> there is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that i hit a gem with this one from beginning to end it had me <UNK> and deserves top marks br br father of two sons hears messages from god to kill people who he is told are <UNK> br br when the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non stop from beginning to end br br and there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub plots and the script is first class br br all the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional br br this film is at least as good as the likes of <UNK> of the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> someone surely had fun <UNK> a whole <UNK> of acid <UNK> and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture writer howard cohen <UNK> the sword <UNK> concept with a couple of extra <UNK> like sex silliness more sex and sheer stupidity this isn't just a movie this is every juvenile <UNK> dreams fantasies come true deathstalker has it all blood violence <UNK> female mud wrestling attempted rape successful rape life sized pigs awful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> muscular bodies multi sexual <UNK> gay warriors <UNK> to the death delirious witches <UNK> laughable villains and boobs boobs <UNK> deathstalker literally <UNK> the floor with its obvious role model conan the barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer <UNK> the story is evidently of minor importance lone and gay only he doesn't know it yet warrior deathstalker goes on a mission as <UNK> by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of <UNK> or something like that on his journey he combines forces with a <UNK> turned human a fighter who's even <UNK> than he is and last but not least a <UNK> lady who doesn't really seem to be a big support of the concept of <UNK> together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil <UNK> where they'll participate in a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> no less than two out of three elements <UNK> is bald guy with half a <UNK> web <UNK> on his skull and an impressive <UNK> that would even make the <UNK> oil <UNK> jealous okay granted deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even <UNK> movie the fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make up effects are downright <UNK> for a moment when <UNK> the opening sequence i actually feared i was watching <UNK> the prequel the monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but it's <UNK> entertainment if you're in an <UNK> mood i presume this isn't a favorite amongst <UNK> as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat <UNK> most of the <UNK> exclusively serve as eye candy in the <UNK> they're allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths the two leading ladies <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are ravishing but in all honesty if it wouldn't be for their continuously exposed <UNK> they would hardly be worth mentioning either
<START> in my opinion this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece if you ask me the stepmother voice of lucille la <UNK> was truly diabolical you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why on the other hand despite the fact that she did a lot of <UNK> cinderella voice of <UNK> stanley was a very beautiful lady to me the scenery was beautiful the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well now in conclusion i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it you're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
<START> cabin fever is the first feature film directed by eli roth roth and randy <UNK> co wrote the script from a story by roth this a zombie film which owes a lot to george romero and his earlier living dead movies and to the original texas chainsaw <UNK> to mention sam <UNK> evil dead there is nothing original here and the story is not compelling the acting is about par with this genre it's just that the story fails we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made having said that after having achieved commercial if not artistic success from this movie roth decided he was a director and came out with the <UNK> atrocious mean spirited pointless though much more ambitious crap fest hostel roth should have quit while he was behind cabin fever is not a good film however compared to hostel it is a work of art i hope somebody preferably a psychiatrist convinces this guy that film making is the wrong career choice as for cabin fever a weak 3 10 for not being as abysmal as hostel
<START> i've seen enough of both little richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor leon <UNK> into these 50s 60s musical bio <UNK> to know that leon was not the right actor for this role leon was so right as david <UNK> in the <UNK> but fails utterly to capture the essence of little richard in this film br br actor <UNK> <UNK> who played little richard in why do fools fall in love was a much more suitable choice having pulled off the <UNK> powerful but <UNK> persona br br if the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well and this is what has happened here <UNK> over or missed entirely are <UNK> <UNK> into homosexuality and <UNK> what the <UNK> did so well in capturing the rise of the group <UNK> and all this film misses by a wide mark br br what is going on with director robert <UNK> who started off so well with the hollywood <UNK> he's a talented funny guy but hasn't delivered anything near that first effort
<START> don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance it is a dry boring drawn out and uninspired as they come and it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical <UNK> take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile
<START> engrossing drama of four men on a <UNK> weekend down a remote river they are <UNK> ed jon voight adventurous violent lewis burt reynolds obnoxious bobby ned beatty and nice guy drew <UNK> cox the first 40 minute are great there's the incredible <UNK> <UNK> sequence interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> then two <UNK> attack ed and bobby one of them rapes bobby and the trip becomes a nightmare br br just unbelievable the scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place to be truthful <UNK> rape has never bothered me i'm very aware it's being <UNK> despite the good acting this movie also shows how the characters change ed has his <UNK> tested lewis becomes weak bobby is <UNK> by one of the people he <UNK> earlier on and drew tries to keep himself sane direction by john <UNK> is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely br br the acting is mostly good voight is just ok in the lead he's been better beatty is also just ok but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a <UNK> role cox is very good especially when things start falling apart and reynolds is just superb one of his best acting jobs ever how this wasn't even nominated for an academy award escapes me also bill <UNK> and herbert coward are way too believable as the <UNK> br br a powerful film not for children try to see an uncut version the tv version is butchered also letter <UNK> viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images
<START> you like beautiful girls yeah me too what is there bad to say about beautiful girls women nothing imo so why would i give this movie only 2 stars out of 5 although it got the talents of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br if i really wanted to watch beautiful people i'd watch mtv or something that's why this is a movie a so called action movie nevertheless so by definition it does not even really need a plot right i'm not <UNK> 100 but let's say yes to that so what does it need 20 minutes footage from part 1 i might be <UNK> a little bit but it felt like more than 20 minutes that would be no but then again you never know the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast so hey let's remind them hey maybe remind them even twice just to be sure they won't forget at least until the credits roll of course br br so forget about the story about character development about real emotions about the acting and no i don't think women in <UNK> walking and or fighting is <UNK> for acting what does that leave yes the action scenes the action scenes are not bad and that's the reason i gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 i was giving this movie a chance but it was a waste of time you have better things to do watch believe me
<START> this is an anthology horror film it's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert <UNK> who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h p <UNK> but is most famous for the original story psycho the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all it would have been better to do it as a comedy like comedy of <UNK> only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way and it's probably the best of them the one with ingrid pitt i've seen a few of these <UNK> anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was <UNK> <UNK> tales from the crypt the anthology style works well for the producers because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors employ them for only one week of shooting or so and then bring in the next big name so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star <UNK> but get 5 or 6 different names on the <UNK> but that's very unfortunate for the audience because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt actually acting together instead they're stuck in these vignettes by themselves so let's take them one at a time briefly br br the first story has <UNK> elliot who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer <UNK> by his own character unfortunately the actor who plays dominic the source of the horror tom adams just looks silly which ruins any possible horror there's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though like the scene where dominic kills <UNK> psychiatrist it's the <UNK> scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching so the whole audience is supposed to shout out look out behind you the second story is the one with peter cushing god i love that man so much too bad so many of his films like this one pretty much stink in the story he's supposed to be <UNK> away for a long lost love and he sees her <UNK> in a wax museum it's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere br br then you have the bit with christopher lee where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs but instead we're supposed to be horrified when lee <UNK> the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil the actress chloe <UNK> was pretty good in that type of bad seed role though br br the last story is kind of amusing ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire that's about all the story has to offer i was surprised at how bad ingrid <UNK> english is i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i've seen her in br br not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror <UNK>
<START> joe <UNK> opening line says everything about this movie it takes place on the island of <UNK> the island of pathetic men and involves joe don baker tracking down an italian mobster joe <UNK> character is named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over <UNK> everyone in the movie hates him just like everyone hates <UNK> clark i liked an earlier <UNK> picture <UNK> revenge because it was a <UNK> for <UNK> year old boys avoid this movie at all costs
<START> the one reason i remember this is that it was shown the week after <UNK> <UNK> s brilliant <UNK> serial was broadcast the trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a <UNK> arm which had me hoping he d be like victor <UNK> from the <UNK> experiment stalking the streets of london br br no such luck because the racing game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical <UNK> trying to get to the bottom of <UNK> of corrupt horse racing i suppose if you re a fan of dick francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when the <UNK> had just finished and the professionals was still being produced there s something lacking about the racing game one trailer featured a car over taking another on a <UNK> way if it d been a trailer for the <UNK> you d see jack <UNK> over taking a car and beating a confession out of the <UNK> who d done a <UNK> while the professionals would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside i think that sums up what s wrong with this series
<START> maybe it's because i saw the movie before reading the book but i really love this movie i've seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more it's a compelling story that's interesting from the beginning to the end it has everything action romance etc
<START> a film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old supposedly cursed house where over the years seven people have mysteriously died one of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie it is <UNK> that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using but as the book is read the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life now the cast and crew are faced with real danger br br imdb lists a running time of 90 minutes for the first 60 of those minutes nothing happens far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting we already know that their movie isn't real these scares just don't work br br there are very few things to enjoy about the house of seven corpses the acting is atrocious most of these actors would have trouble making a <UNK> school play the score is terrible it is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere speaking of atmosphere other than a few moments at the end of the movie there is none to speak of character logic is all but non existent even in a movie you expect characters to behave in a certain way here i don't think i remember one scene where a character didn't choose the most illogical <UNK> available to them and finally there's those first 60 minutes of the movie that i've already mentioned can you say boring br br i haven't rated the house of seven corpses any lower because of instances where the movie probably by accident actually works my two favorite are the beginning and ending the opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie and the ending scenes on the massive <UNK> as the zombie <UNK> the film crew are somewhat effective what a <UNK> <UNK> overall though these moments aren't enough to make this a good movie
<START> e tv is a great channel and talk soup is so funny in a flash you can view the episodes change we want more funny <UNK> by the best writer ever stan evans the <UNK> saint of the mindless masses he is a truly talented gifted writer actor comic producer director and creative <UNK> anna nicole loved him but he was not a <UNK> so he left him for a <UNK> many super stars wanted to make films with the actor stan evans who has a <UNK> bogart clark gable acting style he should make many more movies maybe with stephen spielberg or perhaps many other talented producers we wish him a moment of fame with a great fortune to gain has he produced any mock u dramas or perhaps any <UNK> a project about <UNK> <UNK> would be a great tv movie written by stan evans how many screenplays has he written is he under billion contract with disney he should earn more than 50 million he could also write a tv movie about the late king of pop michael jackson we want to view a lot more of and by stan evans in the movies and on tv thank you so very much elvis has left the building
<START> we stumbled upon the documentary grey gardens last sunday and got sucked in without warning everyone who entered the room became <UNK> on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the <UNK> which was <UNK> on the <UNK> table and the cat <UNK> on <UNK> bed and her unbelievable words i <UNK> on it the smell we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these <UNK> women managed to get in the position they were in <UNK> a must see
<START> would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didn't contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some <UNK> woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isn't any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they don't appear to live anywhere or have parents because p <UNK> films don't need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i haven't <UNK> spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
<START> i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when i discovered this gem i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity <UNK> its ugly head br br the divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938 i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny br br the divorce of lady x is well worth anyone's time
<START> <UNK> first feature ossessione is an adaptation of james m <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice now i'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions but i am a big fan of <UNK> double <UNK> much more so than i am a fan of billy <UNK> film version of it in fact the two <UNK> seem like they must be very similar both involve an <UNK> love affair where a <UNK> wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her giovanna the woman in this italian version played very well by clara <UNK> is not evil <UNK> like the wife in double <UNK> but she seems very spoiled her husband a great performance by juan de <UNK> is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as <UNK> with him he's older than her and unattractive so she's rather <UNK> when gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed she <UNK> she wants to be with him forever but she's stuck with her husband they break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband they are successful and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned gino is very <UNK> about this idea he wants giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life their relationship quickly <UNK> ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters it's always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long at two hours and twenty two minutes i can't for the life of me figure out how it took that long this is partly due to the <UNK> <UNK> that visconti was <UNK> within this film it was after all the first film that won that label we see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any <UNK> to the next plot point i've seen many of <UNK> films and the only one i like better than this one is <UNK> and his brothers 1960 his direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect i also feel the need to point out the film's best performance by <UNK> <UNK> as a young exotic dancer and part time prostitute named anita whom gino meets after he begins to try to break away from giovanna she's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines it's shocking how much visconti and <UNK> are able to do with this character in such a short time she's absolutely heartbreaking 9 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the humor was a bit absent at times but i enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious throughout the film this is the only the second movie where i saw <UNK> acting the other was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and i can see why italians find him tiresome but he think he played his role well as the loving father br br my one <UNK> with this movie was that i knew it took place in italy somewhere in the center or south i presume but i felt like there was no representation of a place this movie could have taken place in new york boston melbourne new <UNK> i always think it is important for movies to have a place to give the viewers something to relate to maybe i missed something if you like italian films then i think that you will enjoy this it's not a fellini or a <UNK> it's not realism or neo realism it's a comical story with serious moments that could really happen to any of us
<START> meek tiny almost insignificant polanski finds the <UNK> of his characters and makes something enormous out of it in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces i had the pleasure to see and see and see again it never let's me down people even people who know me pretty well thought think there was is something wrong with me based on my attraction or i should say devotion for le <UNK> they may be right i don't know but there is something <UNK> enthralling within <UNK> darkness and i haven't even mentioned the humor the mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me that building populated by great old academy award winners melvyn douglas shelley winters jo van fleet <UNK> <UNK> for anyone who loves movies this is <UNK> viewing one two three many many viewings
<START> here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by <UNK> fox the movie presents the story of star crossed lovers one israeli one palestinian in modern tel <UNK> the film's <UNK> comes not only from its depiction of cross ethnic conflict but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well for example there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters openly gay is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of awkward <UNK> wash through the room clearly the young man is not as open as he seems and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be while the boyfriend is confused and rejected a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment as we know from <UNK> jagger fox is a master at <UNK> <UNK> emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences the film is also effective for the even handed way it presents the mutual <UNK> that <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on each other if you're not heartless you'll cry through the last third of the movie though the plot is melodramatic it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be
<START> while i don't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a <UNK> of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans i mean really this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
<START> other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin <UNK> acting was pretty good but he couldn't salvage the movies lack of plot
<START> i have an awful pan and <UNK> <UNK> of boom and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory so i voted 1 and hope you will too together we can pull this movie down into the <UNK> of cinematic <UNK> and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing boom in its director's cut extended version the movie is one of my howling <UNK> just look at the people involved the director the actors the cameraman and you say to yourself yep i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time producers considering the dvd release of boom should note that everywhere it's been shown there have been <UNK> crowds in the theaters but it hasn't been up to <UNK> falls yet
