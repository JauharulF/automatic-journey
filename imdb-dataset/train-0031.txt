<START> as a casual <UNK> of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very <UNK> its <UNK> in the 1960's to me someone born in the 1980's this just looks to me as <UNK> <UNK> propaganda crap but i am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during <UNK> <UNK> i expected drugs <UNK> with <UNK> stones i was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not seen any of the directors other films but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of <UNK> which gave a feeling like the tv show <UNK> badly directed <UNK> put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that i didn't waste money on it it came free with a sunday paper
<START> no not really but this is a very good film indeed and is sadly a forgotten gem black and white suits the film br br straight forward formula a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die br br very well directed and the acting is great richard widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over <UNK> in the acting stakes by paul douglas as the police captain and jack palance never better than this and zero mostel as the baddies sadly palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies
<START> a terrible amateur movie director no not todd sheets his new friend and sister explore a cave the friend and sister fall in and get rescued meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their <UNK> whatever the heck that means this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that it's well bad the humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad now i've seen some <UNK> awful <UNK> films in my time failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low budget films yet i still <UNK> openly for anyone who choose to sit through this only for the most hardened <UNK> amongst you but the rest run away fast br br my grade f
<START> in the <UNK> days of the catholic church a sin eater was an individual that through ritual would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves often these people were <UNK> or similar individuals who the church would not <UNK> thereby denying them entrance into heaven the sin <UNK> were seen as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on redemption sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural <UNK> let the concept wander where it may and you have the order a movie that combines <UNK> 's religious anti <UNK> the x files ' <UNK> investigation and the thorn birds ' sexual <UNK> into an odd <UNK> that sometimes works br br alex heath ledger is a rogue priest one of the last members of the order of the <UNK> a semi <UNK> order of knowledge seeking demon fighting priests when <UNK> mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances bishop <UNK> peter <UNK> sends alex to investigate <UNK> along are fellow <UNK> thomas mark <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who was subject to one of <UNK> <UNK> a year prior the three go to rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre catholic <UNK> ominous <UNK> demonic <UNK> and a man claiming to be the last surviving sin eater <UNK> <UNK> br br written and directed by brian <UNK> who worked with the same principals on the <UNK> and half hearted a <UNK> tale the film is an odd one and difficult to <UNK> it wants to be several things at once supernatural thriller religious intrigue dramatic television pilot and only sometimes succeeds at any of them this isn't helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be <UNK> through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance ledger in particular has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise <UNK> performance <UNK> however displayed the same <UNK> performance that she's given in all of her films most notably in the rules of attraction br br the plot itself <UNK> back and forth between several different story <UNK> leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times which can be confusing for many but this is also one of the film's saving <UNK> the structure of the film coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything the exception to this is historical background on the <UNK> and the practice of sin eating both of which are explained in dry exposition even at the beginning of the film character relationships and history are <UNK> instead of explained combine this with the on location shooting and <UNK> use of special effects and you have a very old world supernatural thriller with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70's early 80's br br a brief mention here as well for the subtle and <UNK> score by david torn a combination of <UNK> <UNK> and lisa <UNK> style exotic <UNK> a very nice score that is <UNK> without being <UNK> and exists in a very <UNK> simplicity br br a confusing plot a lack of purpose and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie but for some reason the order remains watchable many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it still the film's sheer <UNK> will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the dvd which i'm sure will be <UNK> with <UNK> amounts of deleted scenes a recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch 6 out of 10
<START> i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 loved it then about 4 years later i had the <UNK> of seeing <UNK> pavarotti sing at the <UNK> opera house in new york in <UNK> so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night what's not to like about this film the music is brilliant and pavarotti <UNK> was at his best and still looked great the story is actually very funny in parts the <UNK> <UNK> scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen the hot air balloon flight over the <UNK> valley was beautiful so was the song he sang if we were in love one of the few times pavarotti sang in english and hearing the <UNK> of santa <UNK> gorgeous get real folks this was a film about an opera singer called <UNK> <UNK> who just happened to be played by pavarotti kathryn <UNK> eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles br br i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of <UNK> <UNK> sung by him still on film today
<START> the <UNK> is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow julie gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david <UNK> even sees in her br br however the <UNK> at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it watch the <UNK> for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you aren't missing much
<START> after a few lean years 1968 was a pretty <UNK> time for elvis not only did he make that celebrated comeback tv special but he also became a father and starred in two pretty decent movies as well  <UNK> and live a little love a little therefore personally i can forgive him for the <UNK> that was stay away joe which at best emerges as an interesting misfire and is not all that bad considering sure burgess meredith and joan blondell are indeed embarrassing  as respectively a dopey indian father to <UNK> character and a <UNK> bartender who has her eye on mr <UNK> too but one is glad to see elvis surrounded by top veteran hollywood talent like <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> mexican wife the two jones  henry and l q and thomas <UNK> who is particularly amusing as sarcastic chief <UNK> who is <UNK> stubborn father still <UNK> his old <UNK> clothes in the present day br br while there is a surprising if not <UNK> given their usual <UNK> lack of songs there seems to be no <UNK> of free for all parties were the male indians hit the bottle <UNK> while <UNK> practices his <UNK> skills behind their backs as can be expected the typically <UNK> arizona scenery is a major asset here and the sleepy <UNK> bull gag is not only a good one but a major plot point on the other hand the climactic <UNK> of the <UNK> episode is one we've seen too often since and doesn't work too well here
<START> they should have named this movie blonde women that needed to get their roots colored also the main character <UNK> the too tight <UNK> the <UNK> thought the guy did a good job though i keep hoping we'll find a good 8 star christmas movie to watch this week the <UNK> throwing had to laugh at that too we've still got 3 more on the <UNK> to watch maybe we'll get lucky oh yeah i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery and how stupid was it that the two <UNK> followed them there <UNK> on them creepy
<START> beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there br br the characters basically make no sense most of the time br br the film has no real beginning middle or ending nor is anything ever explained much br br the film opens with a young man with the unlikely name of <UNK> <UNK> apparently returning from a <UNK> in the army br br he <UNK> a ride to a two story house that is in extreme <UNK> windows <UNK> over he goes in the house walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there this scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing further about the house or its history br br it is never explained exactly whose house this is or where the people have gone but we are given the impression <UNK> has probably lived there at one time br br <UNK> decides to go to a city why we don't know once he arrives in this city he writes down a name address that he sees on a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman who is a surprisingly fat hooker he sees her for awhile and then he apparently isn't seeing her anymore like everything else in this movie it comes to nothing and serves no purpose br br a young man named <UNK> tries to <UNK> him but <UNK> really isn't interested although they keep crossing paths br br <UNK> is about as crazy as you can get one of his <UNK> is to go to the <UNK> and stand in front of the cage where the <UNK> are and talk at them <UNK> br br we never really know why <UNK> behaves as he does or why <UNK> behaves as he does beyond the fact <UNK> had an <UNK> of old time scary <UNK> religion via his grandfather br br <UNK> later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it br br <UNK> who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching i got the impression he was trying to free himself from the <UNK> of the religion that had been <UNK> into him br br he has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter although their interactions never really make any particular point and there is no plot line br br eventually <UNK> <UNK> to complete religious <UNK> and begins self <UNK> br br it is a very odd film interesting in it's <UNK> but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it br br the cast does an outstanding job but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline br br the film also has the characters <UNK> around the n word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog br br 2 stars
<START> this movie was like a bad train wreck as horrible as it was you still had to continue to watch my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day now don't get me wrong the acting is good just the movie as a whole just <UNK> both of us there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario after this movie i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter jennifer <UNK> is as usual a very dramatic actress her character seems manic and not all there <UNK> hannah though over played she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent all in all very violent movie not for the faint of heart
<START> beautifully filmed well acted tightly scripted suspense movie had me on the edge of my seat i liked the lead actress very much and thought the villain was very well done not much to chew on here in the way of a theme but if you just get in your seat turn your brain off watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot you will have a great time the plot is well worn and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in but that didn't bother me as i enjoyed watching it unfold in the old days they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters and there were some <UNK> moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused the plot got me by the throat fairly early on and never let go it's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as i'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense just sit back and enjoy
<START> this is absurd aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick i can't help but think that everyone else who has <UNK> a review so far was some way involved in the production of <UNK> considering how generous they were with their praise br br admittedly i'm not really a fan of comic book to movie <UNK> so i didn't go in with many expectations yet still i found <UNK> to be incredibly <UNK> the thing that <UNK> me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in <UNK> which i have no intention of seeing br br furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot i'm also still scratching my head over the fate of cary <UNK> <UNK> character which seems to have gone by unexplained br br if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from <UNK> i know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated me br br well hell at least jennifer garner looks damn good
<START> contains some spoilers this movie is cheesy 80s horror in all its awfulness the plot takes way too long to get off the ground never <UNK> itself and then just plain crashes about 40 minutes into the film there are a few gem moments for zombie fans but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror br br the zombies also take a long time to make their appearance first there's a whole half of a movie about <UNK> and prison gangs the hero of the movie is an ex vietnam vet who gets caught up in the mob the main mob boss sets him up and he goes to jail in this jail they are <UNK> on the prisoners to find a way to cure them of homicidal <UNK> and criminal behavior but the <UNK> psychotic head scientist military guy has other plans in mind he wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make da da da super soldiers after some infected prisoners kill a few guards and most of the prison has a round of infected <UNK> wine the military crazy scientist guy goes hey this might be a problem and gives a call to the genius scientist turned <UNK> journalist hot babe ultra <UNK> independent woman character who of course invented the original serum she goes to the prison to see what's going down the military guy calls in a few <UNK> teams from his secure position outside the prison and the hero guy takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a riot breaks out the hero guy and the scientist journalist lady team up to find a cure save the <UNK> kids and deal with some <UNK> prisoners both infected and not meanwhile the mob boss guy has made a deal to get into the prison so that he can save his imprisoned brother the military gets ready to blow the place up and everyone inside <UNK> to find a way out br br there are a lot of gory scenes where people are killed by being pressed or pulled through prison bars there's also a creepy <UNK> scene and <UNK> scene involving the same infected <UNK> prisoner still the most disturbing scene is in the early part of the film when a gross corrupt guard rapes a prisoner br br the main highlight of this film is one scene towards the end the hero woman and kids are trying to make their way to the only escape route their path leads them to a long <UNK> on one side there is a wall and on the other are prison bars hundreds of bloody zombie hands reach through <UNK> their hair and faces as they pass by there's also a few good scenes of the classic couple of zombies <UNK> on <UNK> dead bodies and many zombies ripping one guy to <UNK> bits br br overall worth watching if you're <UNK> the zombie genre as it has so many zombie clichés worth noting it's practically an <UNK> <UNK> on what not to do when making a zombie movie but if you're new to zombie flicks and want a real scare you should look elsewhere
<START> what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is and most us wars recently made only to get some oil br br how many innocent <UNK> <UNK> there has been how many lives <UNK> and how blatantly stupid the <UNK> are br br so let me ask you if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its ok but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly <UNK> while killing many civilians as well it is not your logic fails gentleman br br i'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else 3 in total
<START> the master of movie spectacle cecil b de <UNK> goes west using three legends of the old west as its protagonists they probably never met gary cooper is portraying wild bill <UNK> james <UNK> as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice <UNK> jane the story serves only for de <UNK> to hang some marvelous action sequences on like the big indian attack scenes like that are extremely well done if you don't mind the somewhat over the top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western look out for a very young anthony quinn <UNK> the role of an indian brave who <UNK> at the battle of little big horn this part got him at least noticed in hollywood
<START> it may be the remake of 1987 <UNK> tale after eleven years as the director mabel cheung claimed mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life in which love desire and the <UNK> frustration play significantly crucial roles rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment and yet it is not too inappropriate to <UNK> it as the life of underground rock musicians is <UNK> more intense than an ordinary one the director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music the love between father and son lovers and friends is <UNK> and <UNK> delivered through the fine performance mabel does not attempt to <UNK> rock musicians as artists at all instead she tries to <UNK> a true life on screen making huge efforts of <UNK> working on this project and gathering information in <UNK> underground <UNK> br br daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far his <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> fit the blue mood of the film perfectly
<START> although not one of <UNK> better known works it is a definite must see interestingly thought out i especially like how the director filmed the couple in love
<START> saw a <UNK> of this before last year's award season didn't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all there was not one person that i could connect with and i think that is where it failed for me sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very <UNK> towards <UNK> wow what a grand idea let's see if that already hasn't been <UNK> to the point of <UNK> the whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effects which is supposed to be intentional i can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though anyways i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least i wouldn't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely <UNK> but it's tripe either way boring tripe at that
<START> i wished i'd taped men in white so i could watch it again br br what you mean you really enjoyed it theo br br no i mean i could watch it again to see if it was as retarded stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as i can remember it br br a lot of people have claimed it was made for children may i suggest it was also made by children because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time br br the cast don't help but i genuinely started to feel sorry for them honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this to give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time <UNK> babe donna <UNK> disappeared from the narrative i waited <UNK> for her to <UNK> then seconds later i forgot she was in the movie got that a star from <UNK> appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie this tells you all you need to know about the standard of men in white br br fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to the <UNK> although the <UNK> would be a better <UNK> for this movie though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never <UNK> to toilet humour but considering this is a kids movie this didn't stop <UNK> <UNK> it at 11 <UNK> then there should be no near the <UNK> humour in it anyway
<START> first of all let me say that i had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie the best review for this kind of cinema can be just the silence movie addressed to <UNK> and to <UNK> this movie tries to look genuine and the characters should be supposed real people an italian could never think that the characters might be real they are just low profile stereotypes it gives a very <UNK> vision of what life is in the italian countryside the plot is weak plot which plot and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12
<START> the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget <UNK> entertainment has had to work with all involved should be <UNK> for <UNK> since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys <UNK> pc the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film
<START> absolutely the very first film that scared me to death i happened catch it when my older brother r i p was watching it it was on a black and white tv and not really a good picture but it got me interested shortly after my folks bought a color set and as luck would have it the million dollar movie was showing it one sunday br br i had forgotten most of the plot but it did not take long to catch up and i got so scared i had a hard time sleeping that night i mean sure it was just a movie but it involved a creature that not only came from space but you could not hear it or see it and once it got hold of you it was too late even now after all this time it still sends a <UNK> up my spine a true classic and even better a classic that i have seen scare the pants off a new generation br br long live the blob
<START> if the scale went negative i would be happier seeing <UNK> <UNK> was nice and <UNK> <UNK> has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story the choice of angles choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story oh if the songs and dances haven't caused you to rip your ears off your head first the film could have been made twice at 1 25 hours and been pretty good kinda like seven samurai but the director and writer didn't go that direction even if the <UNK> finally find their <UNK> and want to help this movie fails on so many levels editing writing photography angles style lighting script name any aspect of this film it was bad probably the food from the <UNK> was bad too i have never in 6 years of watching indian bollywood movies seen something this badly made
<START> an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this <UNK> and turning i speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for <UNK> <UNK> but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie <UNK> has very nice <UNK> and left ear br br the only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks br br and indeed it does
<START> i happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient <UNK> across vast <UNK> of the ocean <UNK> <UNK> had developed a theory that the ancient <UNK> in <UNK> managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to <UNK> based on certain <UNK> that are found in both places certain types of ancient sea going <UNK> that we know they had available analysis of ocean and wind <UNK> and the knowledge that the <UNK> did in fact travel in some <UNK> amount at sea br br in order to test his <UNK> <UNK> and his crew <UNK> a <UNK> as closely as possible to what the ancient <UNK> had available using only <UNK> wood and other <UNK> available at the time and set out from <UNK> <UNK> capital to try to reach the islands of <UNK> some 5 000 miles away br br his theory like so much about ancient history is impossible to prove with 100 <UNK> but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right the film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100 day expedition but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and <UNK> that they faced i often wish that academy award winning documentaries were easier to find and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as i am sure it was when it was first released
<START> i've watched this movie a number of times and found it to be very good this movie is also known as castle of terror coffin of terror and dance macabre barbara steele is her usual beautiful creepy self george <UNK> the male lead does a good job with his role the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere and there is a good deal of tension throughout the camera angles are good and the acting for the most part isn't bad this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening i have the dvd uncut version which is far superior to the edited tv version grab some popcorn turn out the lights settle back and enjoy john r tracy
<START> the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin and gross an <UNK> lawyer drives over the gypsy woman and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone ok gypsy <UNK> should be entertaining but the weight losing gone bad nope except stephen king thinks so and michael mcdowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who <UNK> how he she has never seen anything so disgusting than <UNK> hey i can only say well look at the mirror
<START> the plot was very thin although the idea of naked sexy man eating <UNK> is a good one br br the film just seemed to <UNK> from one meaningless scene to another with far too few <UNK> splatter lesbian mouth <UNK> shots in between br br the characters were wooden and one dimensional br br the ending made no sense br br considering it had tom <UNK> and shaun <UNK> in it you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them br br <UNK> points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush naturally and of course the lesbian moments i also thought that the scene with the <UNK> bathing in the pool under the <UNK> could be viewed as an innovative take on the <UNK> <UNK> br br the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too <UNK> br br if i had been watching this alone and aged 15 i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes with 1 hand of the remote control then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza
<START> why did this movie fail <UNK> it's got a sharp script by ron <UNK> and great performances by kurt russell and especially robin williams in a brilliant manic nerd turn that's different from any of his other work a great <UNK>
<START> i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be <UNK> by seeing my home town on film sadly that's about all i got the story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling the <UNK> of the film was blatant women are apparently <UNK> unless they are married <UNK> or both though this was <UNK> as a post feminist choice worse still was the racism the shrill jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty <UNK> the class geek we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of <UNK> and the writers should be <UNK> at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen
<START> strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didn't like this one at all it's awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol it's also filled with <UNK> clichés of characters and situations i don't get it why people liked it poetry hope nope <UNK> didn't see anything like that all in all it's empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
<START> okay this movie f <UNK> <UNK> rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun it's hilarious and the behind the scenes <UNK> proves it you can do anything with paper <UNK> and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about 3 minutes in a shot the director on the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're yeah right man they are totally walking in place it's so funny
<START> well maybe not immediately before the rodney king <UNK> but even a few months before was <UNK> enough my parents said that they saw it and the next thing you know the police got <UNK> and la got burned to the ground it just goes to show the state of race relations in america the plot has white mack kevin kline and african american simon danny glover becoming friends after simon saves <UNK> life in the black ghetto meanwhile movie producer davis steve martin in a serious role thinks that gratuitous violence is really cool until he gets shot there's also some <UNK> in the movie mack and his family come to realize that they aren't living as they really want br br it seems that crash has somewhat <UNK> people's interest in race relations but this one came out much earlier maybe we'll never be able to have stable race relations in this country but either way grand canyon is a great movie it <UNK> kevin kline as my favorite actor also starring mary <UNK> mary louise parker and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them we know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car and that is what happens now the details and the <UNK> are for you to discover them in the film that he may be <UNK> by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap now how is he going to get out of it that's what you must discover by yourself and don't worry he will get the main <UNK> but how is another story a speed boat is no match to our busy <UNK> on the river we also know when he is going to be wounded they did not know what bullet proof <UNK> were in those days it's true recently it was discovered that some <UNK> did not have that kind of equipment in iraq but what is the meaning of such a film this <UNK> on hunting the <UNK> and this <UNK> that does not see that it is the <UNK> that creates the problem but the film is a constant and perfect <UNK> that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this <UNK> <UNK> against the forces of evil why not simply <UNK> these goods so that they can be properly observed and under <UNK> when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them it is the forbidden or the <UNK> that is attractive br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK>
<START> this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost <UNK> of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and that's why i've seen it i regret the time i lost to see this 1 out of 10 because they don't have a lower grade
<START> this is a lovely spirit <UNK> movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth <UNK> to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings <UNK> lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan <UNK> seem to have been born to play these parts i would <UNK> love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
<START> this was one of the best shows ever made for tv full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns <UNK> viewing i was lucky i saw this in the uk they might have got the episode order wrong i can't remember but it at least was on at a regular time every week my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally br br after the pilot we knew this was something special we missed a couple of episodes and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol br br great casting superb acting gary cole was absolutely brilliant better even than his role as <UNK> lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid and <UNK> <UNK> was at her best too since party of five and nick <UNK> of course as the <UNK> long suffering sidekick br br yes there were some confusing and <UNK> bits which i presume would have been explained later and no doubt would have been in a later series that made the ending weak and you could tell they'd killed it made us go what why did they do that with one of the best shows ever shoot the <UNK>
<START> this man is nothing short of amazing you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end he was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain i watch this video every time i am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and <UNK> side of life just like <UNK> did even with his unbearable pain my only regret is not knowing about <UNK> sooner as i visited england 2 times during his life and would have been able to say i'd met him it is <UNK> to know <UNK> is sitting on his cloud pain free rest in peace dear <UNK> you deserve it
<START> aka the <UNK> leads the dance br br lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of <UNK> scenes thrown in the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the <UNK> to me br br gothic lesbians get invited to a <UNK> island castle for the weekend one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a <UNK> running around br br it's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with <UNK> even though <UNK> are lit go figure <UNK> br br dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the <UNK> and nudity directed by euro horror actor <UNK> rizzo this is one <UNK> br br pretty boring 2 out of 10
<START> this film is a very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated <UNK> <UNK> in personally i think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little <UNK> things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has <UNK> in it this film is possibly the worst b rate film ever and believe me that's hard to achieve especially when you're competing with <UNK> by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies i'm not a <UNK> fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie a really bad one if dani made this as a comedy then good going him very well done over than that though i rate it low for it's <UNK> watch it when you're in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you're high on multiple different types of drugs
<START> my 7 year old daughter loved it as disney <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that she would that's the problem with air buddies it's a strictly by the numbers children's film filled with carefully <UNK> <UNK> a couple politically correct morals and enough <UNK> humor to avoid the <UNK> g rating as a parent or even as a 10 year old you've seen it all before and done better before think 101 <UNK> meets home alone and you get the general idea i'm of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story period air buddies which is about as original as recycled paper fails to meet that standard it isn't the worst video your child could watch but there are <UNK> of better ones
<START> saturday night live national lampoon and <UNK> <UNK> are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film br br however it is very interesting to watch now at the start of 2005 twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn't even clever at the time for something called the pregnant man which came true with arnold <UNK> dumb movie junior there is a commercial spoof that probably wasn't even clever at the time for something featuring sammy davis jr and jackie <UNK> called celebrity wrestling which has now come true with a popular show called celebrity boxing there is a mock movie trailer that probably wasn't even clever at the time that features john candy in a movie about a severed head watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to frank <UNK> basket case and finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about a dead dream the only two left the name of the documentary is the last hippies lol br br four <UNK> come true
<START> one of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's scarface is very much a film of its time the first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you <UNK> in <UNK> the costumes the music score and soundtrack the <UNK> make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't this is still a superb film while <UNK> <UNK> music has dated a fair bit it still <UNK> the story of tony montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by oliver stone and the first class direction of brian de palma one of two films that he has made with pacino the other being the fantastic carlito's way all of de palma's <UNK> are here the strong language the graphic violence more on that later the stylish <UNK> such as <UNK> set pieces and of course the stylish camera work br br pacino <UNK> the film and i mean that literally he is the <UNK> star of this film his performance over the top this is one of those films were pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them this time with a superb cuban accent however this is pacino and he does it fantastically only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in <UNK> while some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all this is an excessive film take a look at the production design of tony's house take a look at the violence in this film the chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere the shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to <UNK> and stallone in the rambo films take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so <UNK> performance i suppose is perfect for the film he is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way steven bauer in particularly as <UNK> tony's best friend is the stand out of the supporting cast his performance is so controlled and quiet in a de niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn michelle pfeiffer of course adds the <UNK> robert <UNK> adds <UNK> as usual and mary elizabeth <UNK> makes a great debut as tony's sister br br of course this is more than just a film about excess there is more to it than drugs violence chainsaw <UNK> and a big great shoot out this is a film about the darker side of the american dream in many ways it puts it on a <UNK> par with the godfather films tony finds himself coming to america getting it all living the american dream and then losing it all in violent fashion and by saying he loses it all i mean he loses it all he kills his best friend his sister is killed his empire <UNK> literally around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion bullets ripping through him br br without doubt scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's sure it doesn't have the subtleties of the godfather films but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again
<START> this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i've ever seen and i'm quite amazed that in this story <UNK> wants to finish jesus when the <UNK> as well the other movies state differently it lacks also a very important issue the <UNK> none of the other movies skip this very important part the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event as paul says in one of his letters if christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the <UNK> that were used when jesus entered <UNK> br br finally and in opposition to my jewish co <UNK> jesus was not a myth and as a matter of fact he was also a jew there are plenty of documents <UNK> and <UNK> that prove the existence of this extraordinary man or should i said god become a man that indeed changed mankind i strongly advise him given he is a <UNK> to read about <UNK> <UNK> the most brilliant jewish <UNK> of the 1st century
<START> ok basically this is a popcorn sci fi movie but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence you can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to but it only delivers on about three of them and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot kurt <UNK> acting is <UNK> superb and brings a depth from the character that is <UNK> and rewarding recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to <UNK> your faith
<START> dreck about three beautiful women in california who go to cover some festival or something all the <UNK> are <UNK> so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house what they don't know is that there is a creepy <UNK> there who likes to kill br br yawn boring pointless utterly stupid horror film bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull dull bach and her friends are no actresses their faces are blank all the way through the final revelation is laughably predictable and there's no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way there is some expected gratuitous female nudity but that's not enough to save this boring pointless and unknown for good reason a 1 all the way
<START> anyone who loves the <UNK> music is going to enjoy this film i have some minor complaints mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors not <UNK> who aren't really convincing in their roles but i don't have time write a detailed review i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada the version that <UNK> are the cbc is like the <UNK> <UNK> version of whale music don't watch it it cuts out entire scenes and subplots if you can them that from the film the cbc which presents most of films <UNK> took half the guts out of whale music i don't know why it's horrible what they did to the film rent the video or watch it in a theatre but don't watch it on cbc television
<START> time spent watching this film was time wasted i do not dislike science fiction i do not reject any genre per se since good work can be done in any genre this film however is not good work i cannot fault the visuals when not involving alien <UNK> and the special effects are impressive the story was not out and out bad for a <UNK> comic book but the fx visuals were obviously where all the <UNK> interest attention money went the direction <UNK> between <UNK> and confusing one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial <UNK> the acting was mostly very bad indeed there was no basis to most of the line <UNK> besides a hint of it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad sad scared whatever okay so it was a sf series pilot since when is that an excuse for <UNK> <UNK> in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium i'm <UNK> the pilot sold the series or is the money also in the hands of <UNK>
<START> michael <UNK> plays a smarmy photographer who seems nonetheless to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co produced the film he's a hero whom it's very difficult to empathize with so the movie is in trouble right from the start however it's troubles don't end there it has the production values of a tv movie check out that head made of clay or something near the end and the ending <UNK> in a way that i can't reveal in case anyone wants to see the movie highly unlikely let's just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows 1 2
<START> the first mystery is to guess what welles' original film was like that makes this a real adventure to see an <UNK> <UNK> and using cinematic <UNK> imagine the beautiful woman it once supported br br if you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever as mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple <UNK> one jealous husband as red <UNK> br br what's rather <UNK> is welles' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark <UNK> world the first real noir but even darker it's not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera what we can see <UNK> is someone creating a <UNK> that would later become common br br for all the celebration kane was a success because of the great drama and story the <UNK> eye was shocking but experimental welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self reference of shakespeare with this eye othello and <UNK> are both begun in this period and i consider them part of a single vision with this br br the noir feel here <UNK> on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little they are manipulated by random factors in the environment so in telling this story welles has to make the environment into a character several characters as suspects in the mystery br br thus we have the famous lighting <UNK> and angles we know and have since seen countless times and we have the deliberately closed sets the park <UNK> <UNK> area <UNK> <UNK> courtroom chinese theater and <UNK> i am certain that what was cut by the <UNK> was lots and lots of <UNK> narrative dealing not with character but with these strange <UNK> br br my own solution to the mystery is that the <UNK> did it among the other character <UNK> introduced as suspects in other words the manipulation of black irish who we know from notes and one scene <UNK> at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the <UNK> version the courtroom nor of nature the <UNK> or the <UNK> version the <UNK> br br instead it was a matter of deliberate <UNK> by the gods for amusement this is of course a self reference to what welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own <UNK> a matter <UNK> by the <UNK> opera set with welles <UNK> up and of course leading to the <UNK> where the environment directly <UNK> with perception br br more about the self reference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be <UNK> but i believe there is strong <UNK> comment on his own <UNK> the environment in which he worked the studio environment surely welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character and that <UNK> took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment br br that poor rita comes from china ties up the whole thing the chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman the investment in environment beyond all
<START> this was an absolutely <UNK> series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it all you have to do is read all the positive comments not a single negative that i can see to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable what a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> suited <UNK> there must have been or just maybe still are running around to do that
<START> the <UNK> has always been a somewhat <UNK> ballet it bears little resemblance to <UNK> <UNK> original story on which it is based br br in the ballet the story is essentially over by the second half when clara or marie in this version travels to the kingdom of <UNK> to watch a series of character dances br br there's an <UNK> variety of stage productions that re interpret the story in <UNK> ways not always successfully to compensate for the <UNK> weak <UNK> br br <UNK> version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in <UNK> wonderful first act music the result is a completely forgettable first half christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing the little that there is of it isn't particularly memorable br br the <UNK> over acting particularly of <UNK> which might look passable on the stage just looks silly filmed for the big screen br br unfortunately things aren't much better when we get to the kingdom of <UNK> act ii in the stage version although there are a few <UNK> highlights most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring this certainly isn't vintage <UNK> br br <UNK> is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative <UNK> watching this film version of his stage production of the <UNK> has only re <UNK> this view
<START> this film was abysmal and not in the good way as some have claimed first off the main character is a very unattractive <UNK> second wtf is going on with this van love the plot basically is boy wants sex so buys a van which in fairness is quite cool unbelievably given that he looks like a <UNK> he scores with lots of chicks and he fails with some then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this <UNK> bird who played hard to get then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend and he <UNK> his van at which point danny <UNK> saves the day although he didn't need to because in <UNK> the van the ginger kid crossed the line first i gave this 2 's as i'm willing to assume that there's some sort of 70's <UNK> <UNK> i'm not getting and also because there's some 70's <UNK> too
<START> i have seen it i like it melissa plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated
<START> the forest isn't just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the story is about two couples that <UNK> into the forest on a camping trip a cave <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon <UNK> them there is something you don't see every slasher director don jones gets an a for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level the acting is just simply average except for <UNK> kelly who plays the dead wife of the <UNK> michael <UNK> aka gary kent br br the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple <UNK> through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both <UNK> in typical slasher fare our killer uses a <UNK> hunting knife throughout the entire film except during a flashback when he <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and rusty saw blade to <UNK> his cheating wife's lover br br the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10
<START> the characters were alive and interesting the plot was excellently paced the <UNK> effects were masterfully accomplished and it takes a basic love triangle story and <UNK> in a science fiction element into it i could identify with many of the characters and their motivations made logical rational sense in the <UNK> of the story br br the camera work was great the audio clear and accurate the background music perfectly chosen for effect the singing <UNK> a nice talented memorable <UNK> the sets brilliantly crafted and the special effects performed with a skilled talent br br i am a tad puzzled how an entire mini carnival in a chain <UNK> parking lot could be powered by one single <UNK> <UNK> that seems impossible to say the least the fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though having jim <UNK> in a non clown role was a wonderful touch too as played the semi serious role of a <UNK> very well
<START> a laurel hardy comedy short the boys arrive to <UNK> the <UNK> at the home of professor <UNK> a mad scientist who's just <UNK> his <UNK> serum stan ollie proceed with their dirty work <UNK> destruction inside the house and on the roof then the professor wants to try out his new <UNK> br br a very funny little film the ending is a bit abrupt but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific especially good is stan <UNK> contest of <UNK> at opposite ends of the <UNK> that's <UNK> <UNK> as the professor
<START> i can sit through this movie once but i doubt i could make it through a second time mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay <UNK> the fun of matt dillon think something about mary and the re <UNK> of a more serious acting micheal keaton this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable one of my main <UNK> from the movie was the fact that <UNK> had evolved into <UNK> antics for the most part i was bored with the <UNK> eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the <UNK> front <UNK> caused the same reaction from me go see this with your little ones i e the single <UNK> <UNK> kids and don't expect a lot from this film br br x
<START> there's some very clever humour in this film which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors however after a while it just seems an exercise in style notwithstanding great gags such as <UNK> continuing the part of <UNK> and very good acting by all involved and i was wondering why <UNK> made this film all is revealed in the ending when <UNK> directing claude <UNK> gets a phone call from his dad bernard <UNK> from heaven and gets the chance to say how much he misses him an effective emotional <UNK> and obviously heartfelt but there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it's entire running time some really nice scenes and sequences however and anyone who likes these <UNK> <UNK> of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film
<START> daphne <UNK> is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly if not her than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old <UNK> for its due date of <UNK> problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is <UNK> and the group are short a few people then a killer is on the loose i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one it had a fair set up or maybe that was just daphne <UNK> in it the film is too slow and almost as silent as a library most of the acting is below average and the point of view moments are so old news acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as <UNK> and <UNK> scored this in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie still it seems higher than the movie deserves so other than young and <UNK> this one <UNK> the bottom of the barrel
<START> this hong kong filmed <UNK> packs in more melodrama than <UNK> worth of 'the young the <UNK> this one is more of a <UNK> to the original <UNK> trilogy especially <UNK> <UNK> than a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lee <UNK> wong <UNK> a stunning transformation from <UNK> nurse to hot to <UNK> <UNK> future italian porn star politician <UNK> <UNK> who would later go by the name <UNK> and have sex with an hiv positive john holmes plays <UNK> competition exotic locales and some decent soft core scenes round this one out recommended for fans of the original <UNK> of which i am one
<START> this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening scene br br don't be fooled by the title end of the world is truly a bad movie i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit
<START> there is no such a thing as perfect murder lieutenant columbo knows that ken franklin who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories doesn't know that he kills his partner jim <UNK> who had plans on going solo now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr franklin and returns for one more question columbo murder by the book 1971 is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame steven <UNK> wrote it columbo is a fantastic character with his <UNK> look it's hard to believe this man could solve any crime but he could each and every one of them peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character so no remakes please this part is a very good example of how columbo worked jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin <UNK> plays the victim <UNK> <UNK> plays the <UNK> wife joanna <UNK> there's something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her how he makes the <UNK> and everything barbara <UNK> plays <UNK> la <UNK> she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here i've been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them there was a break for many years that they weren't showing columbo stories at all but now he's back back for one more question
<START> as an <UNK> 10 year old i liked the love <UNK> all philosophy of the 70s sitcom bridget loves <UNK> i did understand the controversy which was about the romantic complications between a jewish cab driver david <UNK> and an irish catholic school teacher meredith <UNK> and both sets of parents harold j stone and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> parents <UNK> <UNK> and david doyle as <UNK> parents who have issues with the young <UNK> <UNK> marriage br br looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences i am amazed that the show was even a success for one albeit highly rated season created by veteran tv writer bernard <UNK> who a few years after the show's <UNK> would write the successful play same time next year bridget loves <UNK> was a very light superficial comedy that <UNK> under its own <UNK> weight br br there was no denying the real life chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> but in later years both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects <UNK> in his short lived role in st elsewhere and <UNK> in family and family ties here they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much <UNK> comic edge which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject br br the show aired saturday nights between two cbs <UNK> all in the family and mary tyler moore both of those shows were smart funny and had enough of an edge more so on the former that the latter that kept my interest in the situation and the characters bridget loves <UNK> was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles br br this was another example of a show that really was not as good as i remembered
<START> they were always trying to get me killed alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white <UNK> <UNK> they thought actors got in the way of things he went on to describe how he'd been given a wire rope to climb down and assured it was safe <UNK> avoided serious injury when it suddenly <UNK> mid descent br br people get in the way of things might be a <UNK> <UNK> made for white suit <UNK> sidney <UNK> <UNK> played blank <UNK> fashion by alec guinness in alexander <UNK> definitive ealing film of 1951 certainly he cares only about his work its <UNK> and <UNK> the consequences and similarly with the exception of a couple of <UNK> characters there's almost nobody to root for in this <UNK> satire on capital and <UNK> br br told in flashback the film concerns <UNK> invention of a dirt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fashioned into the white suit of the title and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its <UNK> to <UNK> it br br while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market the shop floor <UNK> worry about finding themselves out of a job <UNK> and <UNK> attempts follow with both money and an industry <UNK> daughter on offer daphne the <UNK> 4 packs a day voiced joan <UNK> to the <UNK> comic end br br what's to become of my bit of <UNK> when there's no <UNK> to do <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> near the close a notion <UNK> hadn't even considered and has <UNK> again by the movie's ambiguous <UNK> br br a superior if decidedly downbeat comedy expertly performed and pretty much answering the <UNK> raised question of whatever happened to the <UNK> light <UNK> and the car that ran on water
<START> this is a great short i think every voice is done by jason steele you can only just barely tell if you've heard his normal voice though so don't worry about them sounding the same they don't its about 15 minutes long br br edward the <UNK> is fighting the war against <UNK> and he meets some weird people in fact everyone he knows seem pretty crazy br br edward general peterson we have to get you to a medical unit no i'm not gonna make it edward dont talk like that i'm sure you'll be fine im a <UNK> edward and you know it before i go yes can i just have one kiss <UNK> no come on just one small peck on the lips im walking away now sir br br there's gonna be movie pretty soon the date for that is in september but its probably gonna get pushed back
<START> it's not well shot well written or well acted but it has to be the most <UNK> show i've seen since twin peaks every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure they have even <UNK> down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they've just told you everything you wanted to know however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the <UNK> is downright brutal some characters are very two dimensional the more experienced actors like locke and <UNK> really stand out over actors who play jack kate <UNK> and so on the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing however the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously all in all its a great show but not perfect
<START> this film is hilarious original beautifully directed i have become a big bad swim <UNK> tracking it to film festivals whenever wherever i can i've seen it about half a dozen times now each time enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years at nearly every festival it has screened it has either sold out or won the audience favorite award it's clear that people love this film even <UNK> why they do the cinematography is superb the characterization acting brilliant the ending fantastic the direction filled with compassion wisdom the art of perfect timing it's hard to believe this is <UNK> <UNK> first film i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it
<START> clint eastwood would star again as the battle weary detective harry callahan but would also direct the fourth entry in the <UNK> <UNK> series <UNK> <UNK> again like the other <UNK> brings its own <UNK> style and tone but if anything it's probably the most similar to the original in it's darker and seedy moments and <UNK> a classic line go ahead make my day  but some of its humor has to been seen to believe a <UNK> named <UNK> that <UNK> and <UNK> oh yeah however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco br br the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the <UNK> and then between the eyes after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood he's ordered to take leave but it falls into a working one where he heads to a <UNK> town san <UNK> where a murder has occurred similar in vein bullet to <UNK> and between eyes to his case there he begins to dig up dirt which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge br br to be honest i wasn't all that crash hot on eastwood's take but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel <UNK> <UNK> this well assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time quite literal with something <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> it's like he's <UNK> with noir thriller touches with character driven traits to help develop the emotionally <UNK> and eventual morality <UNK> his use of images is lasting due to its <UNK> foreboding <UNK> dark tones brooding <UNK> like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a <UNK> figure harry with his new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing <UNK> it's a striking sight that builds fear mixing the <UNK> cold with plain brutality and dash of humor it seemed to come off a major plus with these films are the dialogues while i wouldn't call <UNK> <UNK> first rate it provides ample biting <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you're a legend in your own mind don't you just love hearing harry <UNK> an amusing <UNK> before pulling out his piece the beating action when it occurs is <UNK> jarring and <UNK> the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> would return as composer after 'the <UNK> had jerry <UNK> <UNK> bringing a <UNK> funky kick which still <UNK> those gloomy <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> score that <UNK> from the get go bruce <UNK> an eastwood regular gets the job behind the camera where he did a <UNK> job with <UNK> <UNK> and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes but also <UNK> edgy angles within those dramatic moments br br eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch going beyond just that <UNK> <UNK> to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry's quest for <UNK> by the <UNK> even though he doesn't always agree with it i just found it <UNK> a real change of heart across from him is a <UNK> performance by his beau at the time sondra locke her turn of traumatic torment being <UNK> raped along with her younger sister is hidden by a <UNK> quiet intensity when the anger is released it's <UNK> accurate in its outcome paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and <UNK> j <UNK> nails down a <UNK> <UNK> and big mouthed performance these people are truly an ugly bunch of <UNK> pat <UNK> is <UNK> as the chief of the small <UNK> town in smaller parts are <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> potent albert <UNK> a regular in the series 1 4 but under different characters how can you forget him in <UNK> <UNK> yes he is bank <UNK> that's at the end of the trademark quote do i feel lucky well do ya punk
<START> i liked it i really did please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film i expected it to be crap it was crap but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it i didn't expect any hidden meanings or <UNK> and there wasn't any but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment and it did entertain me throughout films like this are why the ben <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> something about <UNK> and the vince <UNK> however you spell his last name i couldn't be bothered checking have jobs it's ok to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it and i for one shall take a stand <UNK> perhaps run but not drive because i don't have a car to blockbuster video or even choices and rent a bunch of these toilet <UNK> films and stay in one night watching them good day to you reader p s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i don't like you if you do say it helped then god bless you you will go to heaven
<START> i'd even say some shades of hitchcock this is clearly better than <UNK> which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans by the way did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery anyhow woody <UNK> some relevance in film comedy with this one the plot turns are nice and tight i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so some of the actors are a little too <UNK> at delivering their lines but stick around scarlett johansson proves well cast in the diane keaton type role and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter <UNK> than jackman
<START> i am from the dallas <UNK> worth area and lived in <UNK> for a few years this movie was way off as far as making it look like <UNK> i saw mountains in the background of one scene texas doesn't have mountains i guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in texas is filmed in canada the accents are also really bad they should have gotten actors from texas to play the parts there a lot of aspiring actors from texas out in hollywood the movie is really sad though because it is a true story i pray that the killer is found and convicted the one good thing is that <UNK> of her death we now have the <UNK> alert to help find missing children quickly after they are <UNK>
<START> where to begin <UNK> high tech cross bow with a scope in about <UNK> <UNK> with explosive charges in <UNK> a monster grendel that looks like a <UNK> and obviously never <UNK> with any of the weapons fired or <UNK> against him the heart torn out of his <UNK> chest without any sense of contact possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make up and <UNK> hair the ancient danish court represented in classical greek style the queen played by <UNK> <UNK> more <UNK> by her makeup artist than by madness the effects are way too weak to carry this story there are some stories that don't mind or even benefit from cheap effects but this grendel isn't one of them br br what about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation a <UNK> idiot prince whose home has already been <UNK> more than once by the monster grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than beowulf who was sent from <UNK> from the land of the <UNK> to help the desperate danes in this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth br br beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure i suspect that any modern telling which doesn't make an intelligent attempt to <UNK> the obscurity must fail i didn't love the recent beowulf and grendel which sees grendel essentially as human and sees <UNK> and his danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize <UNK> attacks as well justified vengeance but i had to respect its <UNK> position that <UNK> danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never <UNK> even after it was all over that they had brought this nightmare on themselves and therefore the original story of beowulf as it was written was a <UNK> of the real story i think there's a more complex meaning to be understood than that but this <UNK> terrible secret that <UNK> attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice doesn't really bring us closer to the shame experienced by <UNK> and the danes br br this beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy i give it a 4 higher than it deserves but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently in the meantime sci <UNK> movie making seems to be following the <UNK> policy that it's better to build lots of <UNK> that fail than a few that succeed
<START> the cover of box of this movie has kyle <UNK> name on it but she has the same destiny as drew barrymore did in scream that's the first thing that makes this movie lame they are trying to market a movie with someone that's in it for 5 minutes br br of course we have to have this movie feature young hip college kids that are oblivious that there's a killer going around to top it all off molly <UNK> of 80's teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film it's a good career move for molly to get some money doing a crappy movie in australia so she won't get <UNK> in the states br br either way this dumb movie is about some dumb horror movie that was never finished because this dumb creature kills everyone that's in it throughout the movie we're supposed to guess who's the killer long story short remember our little friend molly she saves the day or does she br br this move is just plain bad rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or just break it on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf don't spread the horror
<START> i picked up the movie with no cover and not even knowing what it was but when i watched it i laughed so hard it is now one of my favorite movies of all time rusty and the guys created a masterpiece i would highly recommend this movie to any one with a sense of humor thank you rusty for giving us something to laugh at
<START> i know i'm in the minority but br br uwe boll is about as talented as a frog not even a <UNK> just a frog he's reminiscent of about a hundred other no talent <UNK> who <UNK> out one useless crap fest after another br br this movie is a crap fest <UNK> talent is only <UNK> <UNK> leading one to believe he's got other things like his failed relationship on his mind reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons been severely hit on the head and made to forget her acting lessons or has one of the worst directors in the history of film i'm voting on the third choice myself although the other two are always possible br br uwe boll has never done a single thing from which i've derived even the slightest pleasure frankly i'm satisfied that he made this stinker i was concerned with <UNK> competing with underworld evolution for ticket sales now i'm confident that <UNK> <UNK> has nothing and i mean nothing to worry about br br this rates a 1 0 10 rating for this messy convoluted crap fest from br br the fiend
<START> <UNK> is a fabulous place to live work and study i've been there twice and never did i hear anything about <UNK> activities <UNK> taking tourists hostage or anything of the sort there are invisible police but it is not a big brother system there are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not <UNK> someone without good reasons br br la <UNK> is an interesting documentary in that the <UNK> it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters the directors of the movie carefully <UNK> out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of la <UNK> and when a character dies there is genuine pathos it is difficult to imagine however that the three <UNK> are all members of the <UNK> <UNK> a gang that used to <UNK> la <UNK> before the <UNK> government began to <UNK> the country br br la <UNK> is not an accurate depiction of life in <UNK> there are of course things to be <UNK> of such as petty crime but when one considers <UNK> happens in modern cities such as london new york or tokyo <UNK> doesn't seem that different after all <UNK> are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war torn country is now <UNK> more than ever
<START> i am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on this has to be the worst piece of monkey s t i have ever seen i ignored the reviews posted on this site <UNK> that it would fall into my taste in horror but i got bored and turned it off let's see br br the wardrobe consisted of cheap cameo outfits and <UNK> outfits from home <UNK> the masks were made from what looks like tin foil br br the gore the gore was pretty good i must give it that but <UNK> burning moon was better for a low budget movie br br acting was horrible i didn't mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in <UNK> <UNK> great movie the fighting and action sequences were <UNK> poor br br bottom line don't watch any of <UNK> movies there are much better directors like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with movies of the same gore and subject matter check <UNK> house of blood <UNK> and the <UNK>
<START> first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies nothing and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i say more power to you i on the other hand just want to be entertained which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time seems that most here agree also most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and well i guess you see where this is going avoid this one sucks bad
<START> the cat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> code br br aspect ratio 2 35 1 <UNK> br br sound format <UNK> br br <UNK> and <UNK> release <UNK> br br a blind ex journalist karl malden <UNK> a blackmail plot outside a <UNK> research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter james <UNK> to investigate a series of murders at the lab <UNK> placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a <UNK> killer br br rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal <UNK> 1969 <UNK> <UNK> conceived the cat <UNK> <UNK> as a giallo thriller in much the same vein as its <UNK> <UNK> celebrated hollywood actor karl malden fresh from his appearance in <UNK> 1969 and rising star <UNK> the valley of <UNK> sadly the resulting film which the ads claimed was <UNK> times more <UNK> than bird is a disappointing follow up <UNK> photographed and <UNK> executed but too plodding and <UNK> for general <UNK> br br malden and <UNK> are <UNK> watchable in sympathetic roles and cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> the dead are alive uses the wide <UNK> frame to convey the hi tech world in which <UNK> dark hearted scenario unfolds but the subplot involving euro <UNK> catherine <UNK> the <UNK> as <UNK> romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black <UNK> assassin in a crowded <UNK> station edited with <UNK> <UNK> by cult movie <UNK> franco <UNK> and a <UNK> episode in which malden and <UNK> seek an important clue inside a <UNK> tomb and fall prey to the killer's <UNK> <UNK> but despite these flashes of brilliance the film <UNK> <UNK> from one scene to the next <UNK> gently without ever really coming to the <UNK> it's no surprise that cat failed to <UNK> the runaway success of bird when released in 1971 br br english version
<START> many people like this movie and many more love it but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is br br many people say the acting was over the top but who better to do an over the top character than al pacino to say that pacino went over the top in here would be an understatement yet he does it so well he just brings the inner devil out of you so well his character tony montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his <UNK> for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level an <UNK> level sure at times pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a <UNK> at all the supporting cast served its job very well michelle pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played on the other hand steven bauer was at his best still he is steven bauer mary elizabeth <UNK> was good and like michelle pfeiffer fit her role very well robert <UNK> i have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell other than pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there they did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough br br brian de palma did a very good job directing this movie whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and i will certainly give de palma that brian de palma though not given the respect is a very versatile director by my count he knows how to direct movies according to their genres but that at times has not turned out well in here it does this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of de palma br br the writing was great it was just pure oliver stone when i saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that oliver stone had written this i was not the least bit surprised that is a testament to him though i have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with scarface nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than oliver stone br br the music was good but not that great it is certainly not my favorite from <UNK> <UNK> the music was a little bit too 80s ish for me but it didn't annoy me the cinematography was good not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this br br this has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons people should realize that the character of tony montana is no hero he is a monster he is not inspiring in anyway he is greedy <UNK> <UNK> and self consumed yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a <UNK> gangster a vigilante would be like mother <UNK> next to scarface br br the good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the tony <UNK> are not the real problem if we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't in a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society he is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it the tony <UNK> of this world are the <UNK> of our society this in no way excuses people like him instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer i love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect
<START> i love full house so much that i couldn't live without full house why did it end it <UNK> a lot of the fan of it can we have a full house ii oh come on but it is better that we have those dvd to help us but i need those real ones to come up with another new episode love warmth are filled the house all the characters are very cute and handsome <UNK> cameron mary kate and ashley olsen jodie <UNK> bob <UNK> dave <UNK> and john <UNK> <UNK> you dj michelle stephanie danny joey and jesse please come back to the screen please how is michelle after falling down from a horse how are <UNK> and alex is joey alone or is he having a wife or at least a girlfriend are they still living in the same house i want to continue the life of full house and please don't upset me
<START> i can't believe how many people hate hal sparks he was my favorite host of the show hands down i hate celebrity <UNK> and generally dislike talk shows but when hal sparks <UNK> talk soup it was must see tv for me i rarely missed an episode during his run and was <UNK> when the guest <UNK> started <UNK> in although most of the guests still did a fine job br br anyway for all the people who dislike hal sparks i imagine they must have never seen the weekend <UNK> they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week and were padded out by sketch comedy bits the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon and in an exorcist like scene his head <UNK> as he told dated jokes about <UNK> food one episode was dedicated to making fun of <UNK> as a bunch of <UNK> hal sparks kept <UNK> through out the episode over running the studio br br ok maybe these don't sound as funny when i describe them but all i know is that besides talk soup the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan <UNK> so if you like the comedy <UNK> of those shows then you'd probably like talk soup during the sparks years br br that said <UNK> and tyler were both great <UNK> as well all three <UNK> brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion of course throughout the tyler and guest star years my interest in this show began to <UNK> but every now and then i catch the soup the show's spiritual <UNK> and sure enough the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time br br ok i've wasted enough time talking about a tv show that isn't on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise go watch something else
<START> no just kidding it was god awful br br i was watching my local sci fi station last night which plays movies every night within a <UNK> theme this month it's space <UNK> or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bombs movies so bad they should never have been made this was a good selection br br everything about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exceptions the gore make up which showed potential and the editing which slightly out did the rest of the movie in terms of being horrible the acting is horrible all around the dialog is horrible the script the direction it's not a good movie br br it consists of two forms of special effects gore and stock footage of space i'll focus on the gore watching this movie i thought to myself what was the motivation behind the making of this movie people like making stuff sure but i was <UNK> to think anything good could have come of it for anyone involved i came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase the make up effects guy's <UNK> reel he rick baker actually went on to a pretty nice career he's worked on star wars 1977 king kong 1976 men in black 1996 and even the incredible <UNK> woman 1981 plus a number of other notable flicks other than that i can't say i've ever actually seen a real live melting man incredible or otherwise but i'd have to say this seemed to be a fair representation of one br br now when i think of bad editing i usually think of maybe a scene where someone's talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene the phone jumps down to his shoulder or something to that effect this movie really serves to <UNK> the fact that bad editing can take many forms specifically over long and utterly useless scenes just about every scene dragged on longer than it should have from a little bit of dead air to that crazy long screaming scene with <UNK> girl and that severed head in the river the head gets thrown into a river in slow motion the movie carries on for a couple minutes and then we cut back to the floating head and watch it fall down a <UNK> while i'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head what the hell br br lastly i'll mention the running fat lady slow motion scene right near the beginning the jerky slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion originally but later decided that it wasn't working like that and then <UNK> it down <UNK> <UNK> in any event if you should ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door all in slow motion mind you remember the incredible melting man for this is where it all started br br movies like this are best viewed at home with a bunch of friends this one's a little slow most of the time but that's just all the more time to come up with your own one liners it's not the worst of the worst but it's pretty freaking bad
<START> kate beckinsale steals the show bravo too bad <UNK> <UNK> as good looking as jeremy northam mark strong did a fabulous job bernard <UNK> was perfect as <UNK> father i love the end scene which is an addition to the novel but well written when the <UNK> is in and <UNK> <UNK> with his workers and high society friends emma must show that she accepts this now she is a changed woman that is too much too quick but ok i'll buy into it samantha bond plays <UNK> ex <UNK> and <UNK> she is wonderful just as i would have imagined her i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality see this one
<START> i was skeptical when i first saw the <UNK> kline <UNK> commercials but thought i'd give it a chance so i've watched it and all i can say is <UNK> this movie was so bad it's rare that i hate a movie this much watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in altman's the player when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers i'd like to know which mtv producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of <UNK> but this time <UNK> name is heath and he's a rock star and <UNK> name is <UNK> would be a good idea br br even that might not have been so bad had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well the direction must have been you're lonely <UNK> for me i laughed out loud during all the serious scenes and was bored throughout the rest the camera work was <UNK> and repeatedly reminded me that i was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy my theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom all i could hear in half the scenes were the waves and in the other scenes i wish that's all i could hear and speaking of sound what they did to the sisters of mercy song more is absolutely <UNK> then again it's <UNK> what they did to <UNK> br br on the bright side there was one entertaining scene specifically the moment when johnny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> face and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you
<START> this movie is not funny it just takes the d d nerd stereotypes and <UNK> them all the main characters make less than <UNK> a year they all live with their parents they're all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the <UNK> getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a <UNK> looking hood on it was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up oh how funny he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports you may have to be a childish high <UNK> to find any of this stuff funny poorly done <UNK> are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make i feel sorry for kelly <UNK> and beverly <UNK> i guess these are the only opportunities available for <UNK> way past their prime
<START> luckily i did not pay to see this movie also i cannot even reveal any spoilers because i willingly walked out after forty minutes of the movie it was that bad i laughed once when the <UNK> <UNK> fell on the guy and the theme song came on however that was only because i thought it was making fun of it but then i realized it was yet another product placement br br i loved the cartoon i used to watch it almost <UNK> although i missed the last episode i heard that they show dr claw and it was nothing more than a claw somebody comment on the show's page the cartoon had penny and brain alot more than the movie had as to that point i hated the setup of the whole thing reminiscent of <UNK> then <UNK> <UNK> with the whole feeling of inspector gadget he is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was another fact is his <UNK> actually work to the point i saw except for the oil slick he also screwed with the tone of <UNK> which used to be in an excited tone i felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly everybody else felt that way too us 14 17 year olds remember the cartoon <UNK> and we loved every minute of it br br i went into the movie with an open mind knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon i was taken <UNK> at how retarded the movie was it relied on sight gags and stupid dialogue for humor disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along product placement is pointless in this film and it shows the wise cracking car is not that good at cracking wise the <UNK> look nice but they were almost overly glossy the cartoon was a better look the silly scenes were crap in the 40 45 minutes i watched the movie not one laugh was heard and they laughed at the dudley do right preview this movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment i highly recommend the iron giant which was sad but very very good this movie is a travesty to the whole family drama 1
<START> a <UNK> backwoods killer is on the <UNK> and two <UNK> couples might be his next source of <UNK> in this bargain basement friday the 13th clone <UNK> there s literally nothing of interest to see in this one the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they do happen completely amateurish it also adds ghosts into the mix for no reason what so ever i felt <UNK> after watching it as if my brain was <UNK> and <UNK> out my nose and it remains without a doubt donald jones' worst movie if you're thinking of renting it because of code <UNK> <UNK> new dvd re release don't bother br br my grade f
<START> as i said in my comment about the first part these two movies are better than most science fiction fans confess br br the scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization but the aftermath thousands of <UNK> fleeing in tiny space <UNK> <UNK> by only one powerful spaceship br br but when battlestar <UNK> appears the story <UNK> up carrying the battle back to the <UNK> planets okay it has a little bit of mad max because all they fight for is fuel for their <UNK> to travel on to find the distant earth but it works for me it is thrilling science fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects even though those tend to repeat themselves to say the least br br i would have loved a <UNK> with <UNK> and apollo on board instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well chosen br br so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978
<START> a group of friends come face to face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful german countryside br br the <UNK> cannibal <UNK> concept is almost as old as the hills that the <UNK> freaks often call home so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress with <UNK> <UNK> rose tries to give the well worn routine a <UNK> twist by <UNK> the action to the black forest and giving it the german low budget splatter treatment the result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial <UNK> particular the non stop use of fancy <UNK> and irritating editing techniques br br had <UNK> rose not <UNK> to <UNK> every <UNK> trick his editing <UNK> offered him then <UNK> might have been a reasonably entertaining gore fest his inexperienced cast do reasonably well the bloody effects are suitably stomach <UNK> and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments all of this however is completely ruined by the awful camera work choppy editing and overwhelming <UNK> of visual <UNK> used to give the film the <UNK> look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film makers br br i give <UNK> 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid loads of nasty wounds caused by a variety of sharp <UNK> and some pretty decent shotgun damage
<START> i watched this movie as i liked the plot a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they're connected br br the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first and best saw movie although there wasn't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace br br there was comedy relief <UNK> the form of the two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and it was a welcome surprise for me anyway to see melissa joan hart hasn't given up on acting yet br br a few things let it down for me personally 1 the <UNK> was way over <UNK> making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies br br 2 <UNK> line about her cop ex <UNK> her into <UNK> when in reality he was the least deserving person to be there he hadn't <UNK> contributed to the events leading up to their capture br br 3 the ending what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on there was no resolution no cliff <UNK> no obvious end it just ends br br and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating the first 2 points i would let slide but not the end
<START> i don't quite get the rating for the <UNK> girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10 what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes there are so many clichés in that flick the women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake there's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over acting over any limits that it hurts it's not funny enough to be a comedy it's too fake sad to really touch so in my eyes it's just not good watching it i couldn't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland but maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation who knows definitely one of the <UNK> movies i've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way sorry
<START> an original <UNK> print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the library of <UNK> and has been shown in a few <UNK> theaters around the world in 2005 according to current reviews that i've found online the original has all of the <UNK> dialog and <UNK> intact they were later either removed or completely re shot by the studio prior to initial release in order to pass the new york state censors i have also read that a dvd is expected in 2006 and one can only hope if we're really luckily it will include comparisons between the 2 versions note that the released <UNK> version was originally available on <UNK> which i have seen stanwyck rules
<START> i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there no plot to speak of it's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera i just wanted to <UNK> that little girl because well lets just say she's real suspicious all the way through the movie the monsters running around wearing some <UNK> was funny i also saw a bit of silent hill in there and i read that this was done by and or <UNK> a <UNK> metal band <UNK> so it's no wonder that it didn't make much sense it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more the fx are very good the look of the movie the monsters and even the acting also good but the story and the telling of it just aren't there
<START> there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can't possibly name but a few br br <UNK> character 1 his name  whip <UNK> too easy so i'll leave it at that boy it makes <UNK> sound good 2 his long curly hair and silly <UNK> 3 his black bart get up complete with <UNK> 4 not sure what <UNK> of <UNK> they've got him wearing but it ain't none too <UNK> br br <UNK> character jim <UNK> 1 his <UNK> doesn't do him any <UNK> either 2 the man is being <UNK> by his hat during the entire film could they not find a hat to fit him even a little 3 his pants are too tight in the rear 4 he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times if you know what i mean and i think you do br br if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western do yourself a favor and forget that thought even the horses look embarrassed that is when they don't look bored br br in all fairness i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre but i've still seen much much better than this br br on a comedy level or as high camp the <UNK> kid works otherwise it's viewer beware therefore see this only if a you must see every western out there b you are a true cagney or <UNK> <UNK> c any of the above comments appeal to you <UNK>
<START> angela johnson pamela <UNK> yes she's related to bruce the killer from the first film is up to her old tricks again she's one of the <UNK> at camp rolling hills as long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex drugs and swearing things are fine but a few step over the line and angela kills them cracking bad jokes all the way br br the original <UNK> camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it this is vicious and nasty too but has no good points to it the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula there are plenty of gory killings in here people are burnt alive heads are cut off throats <UNK> but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical this also has the smallest amount of <UNK> i've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles especially <UNK> as expected there's the gratuitous female nudity here provided by the tremendously <UNK> valerie <UNK> and the obligatory good girl good boy team <UNK> <UNK> and tony <UNK> with the sole exception of <UNK> and <UNK> the acting is lousy even by slasher movie standards there's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an <UNK> boring and sick with a stupid plot pointless nudity and bad gore skip it
<START> if somebody wants to make a really really bad movie <UNK> of the lost kingdom really sets a <UNK> by which to measure the depth of badness br br start with the pseudo <UNK> that follows around the main character some poor <UNK> in a <UNK> white <UNK> costume that looks as if it was <UNK> together from <UNK> pieces of <UNK> work your way slowly painfully through more not so special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden <UNK> just for the heck of it br br on second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half
<START> so i'm looking to rent a dvd and i come across this movie called <UNK> <UNK> it stars james woods and cuba gooding jr and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller well worth a look then or so i thought br br boy was i wrong br br end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the <UNK> of enduring now being something of a <UNK> i can't really tear into it as i would like without <UNK> it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity but questions such as <UNK> has he she they done this ' and <UNK> on earth did they get the resources to pull this off ' are all too <UNK> following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion br br as for the acting you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor's realised that they've made a terrible mistake in <UNK> on for a movie and this then shows in their performance this is one of those <UNK> this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison br br of course this didn't make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling
<START> chances are you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it but if by chance you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time i'm well into the hundreds by now you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends as they say down with the <UNK>
<START> i'll just put it out here that was the worst sequel to a classic disney film i've ever seen in 1950 disney released what i <UNK> as one of his greatest films of all time now take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost tv show put it together and what do you get the biggest load of <UNK> i've ever seen after i saw this i thought it was all over for disney cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after not this garbage this film did not deserve a sequel like this i thought it would be like a twist in time which was <UNK> but better than this also what do we care of <UNK> she switched sides like <UNK> did but it didn't help anyone
<START> french film directors continue to <UNK> with their extraordinary ability to <UNK> the sights and sounds of ordinary everyday suburban life this was readily apparent with the release early in 2002 of <UNK> du <UNK> time out a brilliant character study of of a white collar <UNK> descent into melancholy after having been fired from his job as is the <UNK> of french filmmakers many scenes were shot on real streets and in public places giving a cinema <UNK> feel to the story yet <UNK> du <UNK> also possessed an elegant look thanks to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage most notably a swiss mountain <UNK> running fairly on the heels of that masterful movie comes another impressive french production jacques <UNK> gritty crime caper <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> read my lips actually to tag this film a crime caper does it a <UNK> because it is so much more than that as with the earlier french release it is an <UNK> character study of <UNK> people using their wits to get ahead in a society that has turned its back on them in a paris construction firm carla a shy <UNK> young woman sits at her desk <UNK> to an area of the office that is a major <UNK> to the <UNK> machines and <UNK> br br obnoxious <UNK> use the front of <UNK> desk to chat and drop off their half finished <UNK> <UNK> of coffee partially deaf carla turns her hearing aids on and off at will if noise becomes <UNK> be it the <UNK> of the paper <UNK> or the shrill crying of a friend's baby when her boss calls her into the office to suggest that she hire a <UNK> assistant to help her with the work load carla fears she may lose her job at the <UNK> office carla lists the <UNK> she wants for her assistant preferably male as if she were at a <UNK> agency he should be 25 years old and clean cut with extensive computer and <UNK> skills when the agency sends over an <UNK> menacing looking young man carla is both shocked and intrigued they leave the office and have lunch at a local <UNK> where carla interviews her <UNK> assistant when she finds out that he has just gotten out of prison carla initially wants nothing to do with paul but has a change of heart and hires him on although she is basically kind toward her <UNK> carla now finds herself in a position of authority and <UNK> a <UNK> sense of power paul learns quickly and becomes an able worker carla helps paul find a temporary place to live and even covers for him when his <UNK> officer shows up one day at the office wondering why paul missed his <UNK> during one of their lunch breaks carla informs paul of her hearing <UNK> and reveals her ability to read lips later when an <UNK> <UNK> blatantly takes over a project carla has been working on a furious carla asks paul's help in seeking revenge on the man from here on in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> becomes an increasingly intense crime drama <UNK> into some of the most violently graphic scenes that have been shown on the screen in recent years the screenplay borrows elements from hitchcock most notably rear window where <UNK> lip reading talent comes into full play using a pair of <UNK> there is a <UNK> on again off again sexual attraction between the two protagonists that <UNK> in a rather strange homage to north by <UNK> but it works because of the considerable sexual heat that builds slowly between the two stars that being said what one carries away from this movie isn't so much the similarities to classic hitchcock thrillers although those elements are definitely there but the <UNK> view a of a modern day city in this case paris where life runs the gamut from mundane <UNK> to a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where sex drugs and <UNK> money <UNK> the lives of several characters unlike hollywood productions this is a psychological suspense yarn where the people look like the everyday man and woman on the street where a punch in the face or <UNK> sounds like a sickening <UNK> and where the office is a place to be feared it's hitchcock with the <UNK> off
<START> a charming funny film that gets a solid grade all around i saw a <UNK> of this film recently at work it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day so much so that i figured i'd write in not sure if this film is going to theaters but i hope it does its a nice film to see with friends its a <UNK> and has some funny jokes the acting was terrific especially howard <UNK> and larry <UNK> the directing was pretty good not a film that needed to be over directed what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing it was like neil simon <UNK> and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm as an aspiring screenwriter i notice those things i'm a <UNK> anyway a really cute film that i recommend
<START> wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one outside of the uniform positive reviews i've read turns out i could have never imagined this movie because it's very close to the bride with white hair in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic this walks a fine line between being a farce a comedy and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling there's nothing scary about it that's not the theme it's really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts so the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost this also takes place in ancient china with wild outlandish kung fu <UNK> and a trip to hell more or less some of the stop action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are top rate all the way i could watch this genre of chinese movies all day because they are highly entertaining great visuals and pretty much tongue in cheek and i'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also highly recommended
<START> i agree with most if not all of the previous <UNK> tom <UNK> <UNK> com the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement br br i have seen zatoichi 1 13 15 16 i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 usa zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing the story line was complicated and seemed to be a <UNK> of many previous zatoichi story lines at one point i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film br br this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects a head rolling limbs severed blood and less on the <UNK> of the zatoichi character all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action and won a great following without having to resort to effects br br i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend this is the first zatoichi film from his studio i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films and recommend them
<START> this was without a doubt the best of the dirty harry series from the opening credits you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge eastwood has many aside sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but show harry at his bad <UNK> best loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles this film rocks and should serve as the standard for detective action flicks this is the one dirty harry flick that's raw and devoid of any fluff i can watch this again and again okay not in one sitting because it's a <UNK> out for revenge yarn the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable go ahead make my day you feel lucky punk classic eastwood as only eastwood with his <UNK> <UNK> expressions and <UNK> menacing voice can do it
<START> i tried twice to get through this film <UNK> the first time and it was like pulling teeth and failing the second time despite a great dvd transfer the problem it's simply too boring br br if you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene which takes up most of the second half of the film you have it made but it's tough getting to that point there are some interesting talks by abraham lincoln henry fonda during the trial the ending is touching as lincoln walks off and they <UNK> his <UNK> statue over the screen br br it's a nice story well acted and such but it lacks spark in the first half and <UNK> the viewer from hanging in there i suspect the real <UNK> lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film
<START> this is one of those movies in which people keep saying that's a great idea about the worst ideas you've ever heard then they act on them i like it this <UNK> funnier than any 3 dozen seth <UNK> projects well so is <UNK> br br <UNK> movies have been <UNK> their own origin stories since the 60s but this one goes further what can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck this travesty presents a ww2 suicide <UNK> on the last of the marshall islands presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the us marines away then the japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man and instead abandon the territory <UNK> on their behalf by this giant lizard they <UNK> to the <UNK> where one of them becomes a business <UNK> br br then it gets complicated br br blonde men from the future <UNK> over not yet <UNK> male pattern <UNK> come back in time in a sort of flying <UNK> to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in <UNK> godzilla before he destroys japan the help is questionable as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed circuit tv but hey they shot the script you would think that by the 90s the japanese would know better than to trust people in <UNK> fortunately for <UNK> the white guys you can tell they're american because they say <UNK> <UNK> by bringing back in time the one japanese girl left in the future in a touching display of <UNK> worship she outs their <UNK> after <UNK> a flying suit made from <UNK> taped to a sailor moon <UNK> turns out these time traveling fashion disabled <UNK> are just jealous of <UNK> impending economic <UNK> <UNK> of the known world in the <UNK> century <UNK> going to buy africa which sounds more like a <UNK> than an asset these <UNK> in padded <UNK> suits with <UNK> <UNK> and redundant <UNK> want to replace godzilla with king <UNK> who will destroy all of japan except tokyo a strange choice but <UNK> been known to go out of its way not to have to build that tokyo <UNK> set again br br sure enough we are given the alternate spectacle of <UNK> my garden city and some other <UNK> <UNK> by rubber monster <UNK> areas being laid waste by a flying gold <UNK> 1 3 of a <UNK> in a surprise revelation we are informed that king <UNK> was created from some hand puppets left too long in the <UNK> godzilla also does his share of <UNK> as the movie winds down wait didn't the spaceship <UNK> already destroy godzilla yeah they killed him in the third reel but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear <UNK> ha ha don't worry we don't keep it in japanese waters with which to <UNK> a new godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur only they don't have to because a <UNK> old nuclear <UNK> has already made godzilla whole again oh and godzilla finally gets to tokyo <UNK> with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of <UNK> recognition they look into each other's eyes and godzilla <UNK> as if to say gotta do it man the <UNK> <UNK> in understanding then godzilla blows him up br br i should also mention here that in order to prevent <UNK> <UNK> angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying japan the japanese girl from the future goes back to the future to ask for help from yes a <UNK> white man probably because he <UNK> her as the sole asian character from the <UNK> century he agrees to build a <UNK> <UNK> and send it back to the 1990s so that together these two giant monsters can uh fulfill <UNK> destiny and destroy japan in a wonderful nod to those <UNK> self <UNK> <UNK> heads the girl <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has trouble controlling the <UNK> br br this godzilla suit design owes much to the <UNK> his <UNK> are <UNK> enough to double for rush <UNK> and his belly and chest are thick and <UNK> but there's more exploding <UNK> in this picture than in most of his adventures which makes up for a lot also features a man with a passing resemblance to robert patrick playing a killer robot yes in the future even the robots will have bald spots plus <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her role as <UNK> the only japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her disney <UNK> and an acting style even bigger than that it's not her fault many japanese directors seem to feel that a <UNK> foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face i did some acting for japanese television and i can tell you they push you to go for it they apparently urge their writers in the same way thank god
<START> the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer director star or is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a movie tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it <UNK> without <UNK> to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a <UNK> in which the audience is in a <UNK> struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the <UNK> fabric easier to buy
<START> i was going to give it an 8 but since you people made 6 5 out of a lot better votes i had to up my contribution the river <UNK> was pure genius sure woody was his <UNK> stuff but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the dialog was clever enough and <UNK> card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper <UNK> were fun to watch this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be and a plus a little <UNK> apprentice to go along with it and of course did you notice that <UNK> is getting a bit <UNK> charles dance is always entertaining as was hugh jackman
<START> i will admit i thought this movie wasn't going to be any good but i soon changed my mind the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going pierce <UNK> is amazing in his role as a hit man who suddenly becomes burned out asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help greg kinnear is an awesome straight man as his role as a mild mannered man from denver who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners mostly about sex br br the imaginary in this movie is very well done especially at the <UNK> scene when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
<START> the boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear the voice of an angel that would be miss van <UNK> <UNK> and going under the name of miss andrews because her father doesn't <UNK> of her being a radio singer however she hopes a certain big wig mrs <UNK> a friend of her <UNK> will hire her and then he will have to give his <UNK> br br she leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out to kill them after they ruin the recording session finally things calm down <UNK> we <UNK> them says moe yeah we got away too answers curly br br the boys then fool around in the studio put on miss van <UNK> record and curly gets dressed in women's clothes and pretends he's singing mrs <UNK> walks in is impressed and hires <UNK> <UNK> on the spot for an extra 500 she's asked to come and sing at their high society party that night the rest as they say is history as curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results oh by the way he accompanied by senior <UNK> and senior gusto br br what happens at the party is simply that the truth wins out but not before a few slapstick antics take place in all a pretty good episode i enjoyed it but wouldn't rate it as anything special
<START> since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little i was curious about its sequel br br the little mermaid one is a classic animated feature with top quality everything a grand music score and targets a general audience in contrast the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children because it is spontaneous reflects a child's self perspective the music is <UNK> and less dramatic and the ending feels like <UNK> br br the little mermaid 2 starts out when baby melody is presented to <UNK> side of the family abruptly without any visual <UNK> to aid the drama a giant <UNK> grabs the baby i laughed wait a minute it's not funny the <UNK> being attacked okay i'll stop laughing <UNK> crime in broad daylight and her <UNK> takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly br br throughout the feature melody seems <UNK> which i defend is how most children <UNK> themselves this quality in <UNK> character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face br br like the first movie melody has a lot of <UNK> problems except the reverse queen ariel turns out to be like her father by <UNK> her from the ocean whereas king <UNK> <UNK> ariel from the surface ariel and melody both rebel against their parent br br the music is more emotionally moving in the first this sequel has a bunch of songs but not as much <UNK> work went into it it's great for little ones because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them br br the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting the sequel ends with a <UNK> song and everyone playing in the water it's definitely more targeted at kids because instead of the ending being <UNK> and leaving you blown away this ending leaves you thinking it's time for <UNK> ultimately this movie is fun for kids so we should let them have fun
<START> prom night 2008 br br directed by nelson <UNK> br br starring <UNK> snow scott porter jessica <UNK> and dana davis br br plot three years ago donna <UNK> snow witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher jonathan <UNK> who has a bit of a crush on her now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends once there they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to <UNK> br br pros i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves br br an example br br everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her she doesn't seem that great has escaped from prison their reason they don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends lol br br cons let me start off by saying i'm a huge slasher fan usually i can have fun with even the bad ones i even like some pg 13 horror films tourist trap 1979 one of my favorites was originally rated pg i also enjoy <UNK> 1982 and the grudge 2004 so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg 13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie br br first of all i had a big problem with the story i like slasher films that don't even have stories at least they can be entertaining this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student so he kills her entire family a few years later he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about claire jessica <UNK> is fighting with her boyfriend she has <UNK> and i couldn't care less this should have been a lifetime feature not a remake of prom night br br and then this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes i don't even care that it's not that gory some of my favorite slashers halloween <UNK> the original prom night were not that gory but they still had effective murders here we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds and a <UNK> on a bad actor's face as he screams in agony i'm sure that 10 year old girls were terrified but not me br br i also hated the characters there was <UNK> <UNK> sensitive boyfriend bobby scott porter and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life unless you are a gay male then we had <UNK> annoying friends claire <UNK> and lisa dana davis and the token mean girl <UNK> <UNK> davis if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying try watching this movie and don't get me started on <UNK> collins <UNK> and the dj jay phillips who gave me flashbacks to <UNK> performance in she's all that br br add to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker
<START> three writers made a <UNK> attempt to adapt jane <UNK> hitchcock's novel for the tube yet this television movie has ultimately been <UNK> with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to quit struggling artist meg <UNK> suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy enigmatic ellen <UNK> who desires a <UNK> painted on the walls of her <UNK> ballroom after learning about the last gathering held there <UNK> daughter's coming out party <UNK> decides on her artistic theme never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn't bear close <UNK> one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity <UNK> role <UNK> on camp while <UNK> gets stuck doing the dreamy eyed <UNK> routine only one sequence late in the film the morning after the <UNK> is finished is charged with honest feeling anger and betrayal the rest is <UNK>
<START> if i were to create a movie <UNK> this movie would be absolute zero out of ten stars i would rate it as follows br br plot zero stars video quality zero stars sound quality zero stars acting zero stars br br it is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera made up a plot and shot a movie it is so lacking in any artistic value that i'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie br br however something is to be said for the <UNK> depths the shootout in the <UNK> is one of the most train wreck funny scenes ever first of all the <UNK> simply wave plastic guns at each other <UNK> their arms back and forth to <UNK> <UNK> the pair actually duck each other's non existent bullets no <UNK> no sparks no <UNK> just waving <UNK> <UNK> around if you want to see two grown men play actor give it a spin someday after you have <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the carpet polished all of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the books on the shelf etc
<START> here is an innovative television drama which so easily <UNK> a compelling story brilliantly drawn out character development humour romance and drama into each episode here is a show that sings to it's own tune whether it's audience chooses to follow or not how many other shows on television these days so <UNK> change in tone from one season to the next where most of the other top shows on this site have found a formula that works that brings in the viewers and the dollars and have stuck like <UNK> to that formula prison break 24 and desperate <UNK> come to mind lost takes a different route where even after achieving that <UNK> and that winning formula the team of executive producers are brave enough to completely <UNK> the show in order to service their higher goal of compelling storytelling this is where lost <UNK> itself from normal television this is how it's so <UNK> of conventional tv and this is why lost is one of the most cutting edge and innovative creations of modern television forget the <UNK> lost is has been and always will be there to <UNK> it's cult following first and the general public next but it's a testament to it's <UNK> that it's garnered a fan base which consists of the best of both audiences
<START> this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside spoiler ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to <UNK> the big <UNK> deal to help his <UNK> friends whereas babe the original <UNK> the trend of big budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat <UNK> even more so if one could understand their pointless <UNK> without eddie murphy's zany behavior this film would be a flop
<START> the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day lewis and hugh <UNK> as christy brown <UNK> artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition <UNK> all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral <UNK> i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family low <UNK> working class <UNK> encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy <UNK> witty arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movie lovers
<START> this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think that's always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and i wasn't expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i don't expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who <UNK> to read stephen king's novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies i'm sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong
<START> no i'm not joking around if you ever ever have the chance to see this movie see it if you need chop off your arm to see it see it it's worth it br br <UNK> drives the bus is unlike any film you've ever seen it takes trash cinema and <UNK> it to a work of art while it contains poor shots idiotic characters bad dialogue strange acting and cinematography that belongs on public access in <UNK> it actually succeeds in its goal as a film it <UNK> to be the dumbest strangest most inane movie you've ever seen and boy does it ever succeed br br i will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things the filmmakers obviously didn't but really you <UNK> pay too much attention because the entire film's plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits in any event <UNK> as its <UNK> call it is the story of a bus tour through chicago which is led by satan you see jesus is in town and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die and all their souls would have gone to hell except with jesus in town a <UNK> in hell calls off the job and this <UNK> satan because well he doesn't like looking like a fool in front of the guy so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly but he's a devil so he needs to disguise himself otherwise who'd go on a tour with him right so he <UNK> himself as roger and he gets on the bus where the driver is never referred to by name but he is kind of fat so i guess he's <UNK> the bus and the riders are on a <UNK> course with <UNK> br br examples of some <UNK> the title repeats on the screen 3 times i don't know why a character appears on the bus in mid trip without explanation or introduction and <UNK> sits next to the others and they look at her like she doesn't belong i don't know why two characters fall in love and exchange longing <UNK> that are really the same shots repeated over and over again i don't know why after satan gives a minute long monologue about <UNK> into human form a title card flashes satan is going to <UNK> i don't know why one character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag and is referred to by other characters as the glamorous bridget i don't know why br br if there was one good thing that came out of my <UNK> at troma last summer it was getting my own copy of <UNK> drives the bus
<START> a really bad sequel part 1 had a lot of funny moments part 2 is just bad in a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans br br shame on you otto <UNK> br br the only slightly amusing moment in the film is <UNK> schneider who apparently seems to be <UNK> ed about the other characters it's quite easy to identify with him br br the screenplay is sloppy non existent the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play br br technically the movie is awful as well but who can blame the cinematographer sound guys who had to work with such an <UNK> director
<START> we had <UNK> free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on it was this movie howling ii the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> brown as the <UNK> mentioned eye candy i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i saw br br my friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies if they saw this film they would know why i would get thrown out for laughing so hard br br just a couple of trivia notes <UNK> brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie <UNK> brown was mick <UNK> inspiration for the song brown sugar mick has great taste in women for sure
<START> i saw this film first on my way home from paris to <UNK> aboard air france in august 1996 the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece it's the kind of film that people should be making i still think daniel <UNK> is one of the <UNK> actors around in this french film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his <UNK> for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men <UNK> life and <UNK> changes forever with the down syndrome man he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it's one of my favorite movies it's enough to bring a tear to your eye
<START> the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy <UNK> bring <UNK> <UNK> novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s jeremy <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> ages and <UNK> very <UNK> while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life <UNK> <UNK> and antonio <UNK> make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as <UNK> sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of <UNK> is a reasonable substitute for a non <UNK> latin american country settings of <UNK> home and <UNK> ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere
<START> sky captain and the world of tomorrow an amazingly <UNK> title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say <UNK> island or the scooby doo cartoons it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no <UNK> here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all
<START> guy <UNK> gives the viewer a lot of laughs like most candidates he knows almost nothing warren william a very under rated actor is superb in giving <UNK> to <UNK> that is he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public a campaign based on no comment i'll take it under <UNK> and maybe yes but then again maybe no is the nearly perfect way to win an election <UNK> the dumber the candidate the greater the chance he or she will win after all the public can identify with such a person with respect to the movie it makes for a lot of comedy
<START> i have seen this film only the one time about 25 years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly <UNK> this film i wish it was available on dvd
<START> this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese <UNK> is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese <UNK> i studied them in school it is very complicated you just have to take what it gives you enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride <UNK>
<START> all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable <UNK> <UNK> run lola run <UNK> plays kate a <UNK> on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentions br br plot holes and <UNK> are <UNK> and there are very few moments that are actually <UNK> scary but plenty that are just plain dull br br all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour br br the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell who's done better than this  that's even including <UNK> <UNK>
<START> for a lot of time i was looking forward to see this movie here in <UNK> japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters we can find some of those movies in some underground stores and i just found <UNK> i was expecting something good but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene the rest of the movie is boring and senseless just plain stupid with a lot of useless scenes and a boring story i am wasting my time even writing about this film sorry but is the truth
<START> some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a <UNK> graduate <UNK> in film school br br there are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for his her <UNK> secondly all the acting is awful even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so <UNK> here you feel like you're at a <UNK> but one of those wretched company employee <UNK> where you drink too much cheap beer and get your <UNK> before you even stop drinking then you eat an <UNK> <UNK> and throw up br br all right i'm being a little rough on a young director who might still go places as i said the camera work is quite good br br but i feel cheated the <UNK> for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd <UNK> has pictures on it that suggest this as well but nobody actually connected to the film's making seems to know that this is the kind of film they're supposed to be making br br that betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we don't like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just don't care br br i took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldn't give me my money back br br now that really hurts
<START> this was great when i saw the japanese version first it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen it was not blood and guts it was eerie atmospheric and terrifying when the mother ghost <UNK> over the bed in the japanese version i nearly had a heart attack i was concerned that the american version would be watered down and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version i <UNK> have been concerned the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand and gave the direction of the movie to the same man they also set it in japan in the same location in the same house in fact the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original the only difference was the casting of american actors that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of strangers in a strange land to the overall horror not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land having difficulty <UNK> into society it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch br br buffy actually does a very good job she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well there are none of the smart <UNK> remarks that are so common to american horror movies or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation in fact it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of <UNK> we are finally getting movies that actually can be <UNK> as horror 8 10
<START> i really enjoyed this movie the script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding it is a down to earth movie with characters one cares about it brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards
<START> the film begins with promise but <UNK> too long in a <UNK> world of distance and alienation we are left hanging but with nothing much else save <UNK> shots of grave and <UNK> male faces to <UNK> certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over it's a shame because the concept is not without merit br br we are left wondering why a loving couple a father and son no less should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is <UNK> when claustrophobic beyond all imagining this loss of presence in the real world is rather too obviously and unnecessarily <UNK> with the son having <UNK> in the armed forces why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some colour we are left with a <UNK> sense of loss but sadly no enlightenment which is <UNK> given the film is apparently about some form of <UNK> not available to us all
<START> a badly acted two character comedy drama abruptly <UNK> into a weren't we awful to the indians <UNK> with lousy special effects exploitative use of nudity and ugly violence it's as sincere as a <UNK> <UNK> as obvious as a car <UNK> pitch one of the worst movies in the history of the universe absolute and utter dreck
<START> let's be honest here the only reason anyone bought this the only reason anyone reviewed this and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch's children but guess what even david lynch can produce a piece of crap br br maybe lynch wanted you to <UNK> <UNK> and experience absurdity in itself as a pure subject of knowing maybe the atrocious <UNK> sounds and chicken scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about <UNK> place in the world about our relation to the real about the absurdity of it all br br instead it just says one thing to me i just lost 20 br br if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive i could <UNK> <UNK> on high and let me ears bleed if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes br br there is a single redeeming quality to <UNK> it is <UNK> <UNK> funny that is it is so bad that it isn't even funny because it's so bad this fact however is a little funny br br if you hate yourself and hate your money then buy <UNK> if not spare yourself the agony
<START> a well made run of the mill movie with a tragic ending <UNK> the way the story moves begins with <UNK> struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there the music a <UNK> look at the life of policemen <UNK> the violence and the gore but i guess they add to the realistic effects still having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and <UNK> could have been avoided br br no complaints 7 10
<START> the first <UNK> of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on unless you read the book which i had not br br if you can stick with the first half the second half is sweet predictable yes but sweet none the less br br the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80's not 2005 br br no stand out moments bland but it moved along without boring me br br i would like to know why keaton selected this role her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance
<START> the bill was essentially a cultural <UNK> from which a beautiful <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> emerged inspiring such famed <UNK> as cop land the <UNK> the godfather 3 and most recently of course the wire br br with multi <UNK> characters and story lines that have been described as <UNK> dimensional <UNK> the bill grabbed you by the <UNK> from episode one and just would not let you go br br the show covered anticipated and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and <UNK> the most <UNK> <UNK> moment being episode 19 of series 5 which aired on the eve of the second <UNK> war detective jim <UNK> misguided and ultimately career ending drugs raid on craig <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flat in the <UNK> allen estate in early 2003 was widely viewed as a <UNK> allegory for the <UNK> failure to find weapons of mass destruction following the invasion of iraq several months later br br however it was the work the bill did to try and highlight some of the lesser known problems experienced by police officers that won it the most praise this was sympathetic drama covering such sensitive areas as helmet <UNK> under uniform cross dressing in van homosexuality lost <UNK> casual drunken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> syndrome <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> caused by chasing suspects while wearing an overly <UNK> uniform and many many more issues that still trouble <UNK> haunt and <UNK> officers to this day br br the last word should go to one of the <UNK> most famous fans nelson <UNK> <UNK> is no exaggeration to say that i would not have made it through the dark void of loneliness that summed up my last years of <UNK> on <UNK> island if it wasn't for the heart warming casual <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> my name is john <UNK> and this is my story about paperhouse in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock's psycho i was very scared and deeply disturbed i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way but none where satisfactory amongst those tried and failed were the birds night of the living dead the silence of the <UNK> the blair witch project ring the evil dead the sixth sense 28 days later the texas chainsaw massacre halloween near dark alien <UNK> tom the cell rosemary's baby don't look now <UNK> general friday the 13th and the omen that should confirm i was desperate long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse <UNK> br br paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own called <UNK> dreams paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film i discovered the truth while on the internet i bought the film later that day br br i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull <UNK> it certainly was but dull certainly not it was the answer to my <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> anna in the film but most of the original story is the same one day in school anna draws a house in her <UNK> book nothing remarkable about that then she becomes ill and every time she <UNK> or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house and i mean genuinely unnerving more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the <UNK> <UNK> an apple tree anna draws into the <UNK> a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world mark is a <UNK> but wants to leave the house <UNK> anna draws in a <UNK> a place to go to but still the problem remains mark can't walk so anna decides to draw her father in she gets her <UNK> out and gets too work but the outcome is <UNK> and unsettling anna particularly <UNK> his eyes quote he looks like madman so anna tries to rub him out and start again but the <UNK> proves <UNK> that means nothing can be <UNK> out then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the <UNK> action br br paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years the question is how dose the compare with psycho answer 1 the old dark house 2 psychological <UNK> fears 3 a genuine shock 4 and very scary music
<START> this movie is another horror anthology it is rather good but it could have used a bit more i compare it to doctor <UNK> house of horrors though in this one the title fits it has four stories all somewhat connected by a house the first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in he creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer <UNK> around in his house this one is sort of predictable but it does throw a few twists in the end the next story is a bit more unpredictable and you really do not know where the heck it is going this one features peter cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch this guy buys the house but it is not the house that takes center stage but a rather strange wax museum the third story starts out rather good and features christopher lee this one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter the problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough it drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop the actor really gets what he paid for then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened though i was not very satisfied with the explanation as i don't think it really explained <UNK> story much at all i think they needed a bit more back story for that one all in all though it was an interesting set of stories
<START> i loved the original scary movie i'm a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then <UNK> forgot it when making the sequel i think the <UNK> are a family of comical geniuses alas even geniuses make mistakes br br the movie begins with promise i liked the exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag now that's wayans quality material but other than that i can only think of two other times i laughed 1 when <UNK> spelling is <UNK> in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes <UNK> and starts talking about marriage with him meanwhile he's saying it was just a <UNK> call that was kinda funny 2 the save the last dance parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves but even the short lived <UNK> are no match for the side splitting laughs of the first scary movie br br the rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap gross out gags jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are <UNK> and overdone for example in scary movie i several <UNK> are made to imply that the character ray is gay this was hilarious but in scary movie ii the whole penis <UNK> scene with ray under the bed was mind numbing and incredibly unfunny this is the pattern of the whole film shock humor alone doesn't take a movie very far this was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately br br as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low i have to give this one a 2 out of 10
<START> spider man is in my opinion the best superhero ever and this game is the best superhero game ever while it may be somewhat easy you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game it may seem hard to control at first but once you get the hang of it you will be web <UNK> like spider man himself br br the bosses while like the levels are somewhat easy are fun the first boss <UNK> is incredibly easy to beat which shouldn't be so because as fans of the comic books know <UNK> is one of spider man's most deadly villains the second boss <UNK> is also very easy the 3rd boss is <UNK> who is in my opinion the <UNK> boss in the game which <UNK> shouldn't be the 4th boss is <UNK> again this time he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy the <UNK> boss is <UNK> who i think is the <UNK> boss to battle in the game he is also one of the harder bosses but once again still fairly easy next boss is carnage who is you guessed it easy to beat but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight <UNK> boss is doctor <UNK> who is like all the other bosses easy but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield the <UNK> and final boss is <UNK> to the game never in a comic book or cartoon i won't spoil it for you for those of you who haven't played the game but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn't too easy took me 4 or 5 tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries br br all in all a very good game i gave it an 8 out of 10 the reasons why i didn't give it a 9 or 10 are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring getting all that stuff will take a while though it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show the bosses are too easy and they should have used <UNK> and or green <UNK> as a boss i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air they didn't use them in the sequel to this game either well the green <UNK> is the villain in the upcoming spider man movie so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie
<START> from the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless <UNK> is at work richard widmark stealing from a woman's purse jean peters pickup on south street is relentlessly fascinating to watch partly it's because the acting is uniformly strong from the entire cast the b w photography is crisp and adds to the <UNK> of the story and characters and because samuel <UNK> direction puts him in the same league with the <UNK> like john <UNK> jungle huston in fact it has the same urgency as the huston film about a heist that goes wrong but the payoff is not quite as strong br br jean peters is excellent as the hard edged girl whom widmark describes as being knocked around a lot she gives a lot of raw energy and sex appeal to her role of the not too bright woman carrying a <UNK> film in her purse for her boyfriend richard <UNK> something the fbi already knows about they're on her trail when the <UNK> occurs br br thelma ritter adds realism to her portrait of a woman called moe who buys and sells anything to make a profit and ends up paying for it with her life she's particularly touching in her final scene with <UNK> br br this one is guaranteed to hold your attention through its one hour and twenty minute running time good noir from fox and notable for the performances of widmark peters and ritter
<START> to start off with since this movie is a remake of a classic the rating has to be <UNK> already since this version stars viggo <UNK> in the lead role of <UNK> it helps br br isn't this just like the united states government though to <UNK> one of its own citizens sounds like jason <UNK> character from the movie but it is the truth the government would do anything possible to destroy a man's life for trying to get home to his wife a wife who is in labor no less and may not make it br br there was a time in this country that the police would <UNK> a man to his pregnant wife the words of the disc <UNK> br br there were some great shots of scenery in this film and great car chases and a lot of <UNK> after much consideration i gave this film a 7
<START> hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began first any play on of the living dead <UNK> his <UNK> mr romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to <UNK> and second my movie watching companion <UNK> doubt that any urban horror film would <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in the hood skeptical we settled in to watch br br we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good hearted zombie film oh certainly the budget is low and of course the <UNK> amateurs friends <UNK> the cast but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema cheap yeah but when it's this cheap you can clearly see where love holds it together br br ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night he dreams of moving out of <UNK> before this planned escape however his brother is shot to death in a drive by <UNK> keen scientific mind presents an option superior to <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> of his <UNK> experimental <UNK> formula sadly little <UNK> wakes up in an <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> zombie chaos and mayhem i think it's more <UNK> to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive by but then again i'm a poor judge of the <UNK> of urban life how poor a judge in response to a gory scene involving four men i <UNK> ah ha white t shirts on everyone so the blood shows up <UNK> i used the same technique in my own low budget horror film jordan <UNK> no that's gang dress white t shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result oh br br a lot of the movie is set in someone's living room so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere it surpasses its budget in spirit br br zombie explanation when man plays god zombies <UNK> or perhaps follow <UNK> <UNK> testing rules before human <UNK> br br contribution to the zombie <UNK> this is the first zombie movie i've seen with a drive by shooting as far as the actual zombies go <UNK> is spread with a bite as usual but quite unusually head shots don't work it's heart shots that kill zombies have <UNK> the absence of which proves true death and these zombies make pretty cool <UNK> <UNK> noises br br gratuitous zombie movie in joke a <UNK> named romero <UNK> br br favorite zombie <UNK> noise little brother zombie of course
<START> entertaining musical where nathan detroit needs 1 000 00 to get up a floating crap game so he <UNK> sky masterson to try and get salvation army girl played by jean simmons to go with masterson to <UNK> br br 5 years later simmons would be in the <UNK> again in the fabulous elmer <UNK> there she was sister sharon and here she is sister sarah same <UNK> different story br br frank sinatra is that <UNK> nathan detroit he has been engaged to vivian <UNK> for 14 years and she <UNK> his gambling habit br br in a real change of pace sky masterson was played by marlon brando who actually did his own singing here br br the film is saved by <UNK> choreography those dance and singing routines are fabulous they are especially realized by <UNK> <UNK> as nicely nicely johnson br br all in all it's a very nice production
<START> dani reese <UNK> has always been very close with her older sister maureen emily <UNK> until they both start falling in love with their neighbor court jason london but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away br br this was truly a heartbreaking story about first love probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen all the acting is amazing and reese <UNK> gives a great performance in her first movie i would give the man in the moon 8 5 10
<START> jessica a ghost story is as the name implies a ghost story the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy br br a woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead this <UNK> what this movie attempts to pass off as a plot there is really nothing more to it the movie <UNK> of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death br br immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of a straight to dvd effort unlike gems such as <UNK> 2 the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straight to dvd movies a bad name the direction is as poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense scares or tension even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring br br the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career br br many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue <UNK> i'm not <UNK> br br the only reason i give this movie a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for a few unintentional laughs i stress the word few in that sentence this is not overall one of the so bad it's good movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre if you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies if you want to see a proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house the <UNK> <UNK> the eye original korean version the grudge one missed call or phone br br i advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica a ghost story to keep up the good work just forget this movie exists don't spare a thought for it
<START> men of honor has many great aspects to it good action sequences plenty of feel good scenes a good musical score but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting mostly by robert deniro the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further it is a good story but it seems like it has been done many times before a person against all of the odds won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago it could happen but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c o of the diving school <UNK> with his final test however all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie deniro plays <UNK> chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending as soon as deniro come in he <UNK> this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible <UNK> before the movie ends deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film but admit it if it was all the truth it would have you <UNK> it your seat by the first twenty minutes
<START> the sopranos 1999 2007 br br number 1 television show of all time br br everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode the sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time br br james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast edie <UNK> is superb as the worrying loving upper middle class mother tony <UNK> is tremendous as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is often very funny br br while the show has often been <UNK> for the negative stereotype of italian americans as <UNK> and to an extent this is <UNK> i can see so many <UNK> from the show the portrayal of strong family values friendships love and compassion could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters yes furthermore other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism social <UNK> and injustice homosexuality drugs etc this is no shallow dull show about tough guys and violence it has so much more many of the issues we see on the show are very real br br the writing which has been pretty much great has <UNK> so successfully current issues and managed to <UNK> them within the characters' lives which makes the whole thing more interesting br br credit must go to david chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to james gandolfini for <UNK> <UNK> most complex and enigmatic character br br simply exceptional br br 10 10
<START> i'm not sure how related they are but i'm almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie or the story that it's based on very similar <UNK> and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar lost delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one instead br br this one moves very slowly but being a late 60s french movie that is to be expected of the style told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls <UNK> the school the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each <UNK> ie hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a <UNK> school finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie
<START> this is yet another tell it as it is <UNK> <UNK> film i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child <UNK> <UNK> and g y concepts to the indian <UNK> audience but i find some of those scenes really disgusting what's new it is a nice piece put together by <UNK> where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film mr mrs <UNK> what makes this movie different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter <UNK> with or is friends with such as her <UNK> her colleagues film stars models rich people and others featured in the entertainment page 3 in her newspaper br br noticeable it is another good performance from mrs <UNK> she is likely to be noticed for this role she does <UNK> roles but shines in them she is <UNK> de <UNK> and less beautiful in this film but then entertainment <UNK> are not supposed to <UNK> the people they cover right verdict <UNK> has come up with another good movie that brings social issues to the <UNK> very nicely however this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey br br is he trying to show us the <UNK> and <UNK> of the rich people or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and <UNK> that with the life of the real crime reporter is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g y folk the other concepts brought forth include the <UNK> rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co stars if they wish to enter bollywood br br in addition he talks about how flight <UNK> get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme <UNK> by marrying much elder people etc he also talks about unhappy women and <UNK> kids in rich families br br this was all okay for me but might be too complex for an average movie goer who just wants to <UNK> some stress from day to day work
<START> blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense at one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring br br they begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them a girl says she <UNK> they'll find a blue monkey br br yes thats it totally <UNK> to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a <UNK> basement br br i'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember i suppose
<START> <UNK> is the first film which stephen king has written a script for given this and the excellent <UNK> johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie you would be expecting a odd and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience unfortunately that's not what you'd be getting the thing is they could have probably made it a good movie the beginning is intriguing what with it's small town spooky atmosphere but something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film the film turns funny for no apparent reason from that moment on the whole atmosphere of <UNK> is ruined for those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old johnny screaming out cop <UNK> after <UNK> the <UNK> into that one <UNK> ear but don't get me wrong the humor has no <UNK> quality i just rented it again to see if <UNK> i was wrong the first time around given how original the plot sounded but i was right man what a waste i can't believe they got the rights to that <UNK> johnny song i gave this a 2
<START> not only is this a great african american classic comedy but one of many great american cult classics i have recently purchased the collection edition of <UNK> ray moore if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies this is for you they don't make movies like these anymore my entire family are movie buffs so this site is an extreme help on solving many <UNK> i am <UNK> in iraq right now this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states thank you imdb i recommend this site to all my friends <UNK> rules don't just take my word for it check them out for yourself ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think but if it gets the point across i'm all for it
<START> a movie about the cruelty of this world i found it <UNK> as only truth can be it also contains some quite funny bits some of the acting is extraordinary see maria <UNK> for instance the director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible <UNK> <UNK> the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard core movie although i hardly understood a sentence i found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost the voice of the character played by maria <UNK> is particularly hard to <UNK> by a <UNK> br br my favorite movie
<START> i <UNK> just to make this comment which pretty much <UNK> some of the ones here already the acting is worse than <UNK> it <UNK> on <UNK> held stereotypes has some of the worst displays of tasteless female <UNK> all <UNK> no brain and has some of the <UNK> lines known to man br br including but not limited to <UNK> lets see what these guys can do i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves eddie <UNK> character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy <UNK> that just <UNK> people the wrong way he may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn't allow for that kind of character exploration you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys <UNK> 11 this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience br br even the cars can't make up for this <UNK> of a movie that <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> sums up this movie perfectly it just sucks
<START> ursula <UNK> naked body is one of those things that make you believe in god the other two women especially the one who plays the maid have great bodies as well then why is the higher grade that i can give to a film with such quality and <UNK> of nudity only 3 out of 10 because to get to <UNK> unbelievable body we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring keep in mind that i watched the full 101 minute version not the <UNK> minute american one which probably cuts out a lot of the <UNK> material in typical italian comedy tradition most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures the army freak the latin lover the constant drunk the naive maid that are not funny simply <UNK> final word watch this but keep your finger on the fast forward button you're gonna need it
<START> this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesn't succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull long <UNK> <UNK> they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i can't believe what a laughable movie this was br br and i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away <UNK> hit a <UNK> <UNK> 17 movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the <UNK> or something aimed at teens pathetic
<START> <UNK> is the disturbing yet riveting screen version of a play by william <UNK> who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives after her roommates leave for work the next day the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her the story takes a surprising twist when at one point the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to <UNK> him but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested he will just get off she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him far fetched maybe disturbing definitely but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film especially the middle with just the woman and her <UNK> that you can't help but feel completely a part of what's going on i did not see the play on broadway but i would imagine a piece like this works better <UNK> but that doesn't make this film any less riveting an experience farrah fawcett one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway was awarded the role of <UNK> in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim many critics found <UNK> performance to be one note but for me <UNK> is a woman completely <UNK> by what she has been through and the performance works for me james russo in the performance of his career is slimy and menacing as the would be rapist who finds <UNK> to be much more of a challenge than he assumed <UNK> <UNK> and diana <UNK> co star as <UNK> roommates who come home after <UNK> has <UNK> the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their <UNK> upon their arrival and it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn't see what we saw <UNK> go through and therefore think she should call the police and let them handle the guy not for the faint of heart but if you can stand it a gripping film experience <UNK> by a lead performance that will surprise you
<START> i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time so i was <UNK> it greatly when it arrived my worst fears were that it would be plodding as well as well you know what all the screaming fan girls were <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> love that sort of thing <UNK> it i was very very pleasantly surprised the movie was surprisingly watchable even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun <UNK> every two scenes and the acting on <UNK> part was quite good hyde being um hyde acted as a quasi romantic friend gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by he's one of my two major <UNK> with the film itself but the rest of the cast including the child actors in the opening scene were very good at doing what they did which was mostly get shot at and <UNK> at but my second problem was very minor having to do with the <UNK> it seemed way too suspense horror to me like every scene where someone is shot they either <UNK> over really most sincerely dead or lay there <UNK> for a rather long time but sho just takes the shots repeatedly <UNK> over <UNK> a lot while he talks and makes hyde cry all in all if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j film fan it's definitely worth a watch
<START> this is an entertaining history of the fbi but it should be viewed as fiction because that's exactly what it is what else could it be when j edgar hoover personally <UNK> and had a cameo role in the production james stewart is excellent as usual and the supporting cast except for the talentless vera miles is good murray hamilton is especially good in a supporting role as stewart's partner and best friend the fbi <UNK> that the film highlights are undoubtedly all true what is significant is what it leaves out br br one of the most shameful parts of the film is the depiction of the killing of john dillinger it is portrayed pretty much as it happened but no mention at all is made of <UNK> <UNK> the chicago <UNK> chief who headed the operation instead the operation is depicted as if the fictional chip <UNK> were running it it has been said that hoover was jealous of the publicity that <UNK> received after dillinger was killed <UNK> was subsequently transferred to a remote <UNK> and shortly afterward left the fbi this is no doubt why <UNK> was never mentioned in the film but this viewer at least <UNK> to think that if <UNK> was treated this way what about all the agents who <UNK> all the other <UNK> depicted in the film were they also completely ignored and replaced by the fictional <UNK> br br the film is probably accurate in its portrayal of fbi activity up through the end of wwii however after that point the film would have us believe that the only threat facing the us came from international communism which is no doubt what hoover believed never mind the mafia never mind the <UNK> that were still going on in the south never mind that blacks were being <UNK> to keep them from voting in much of the south i don't know if the fbi had started <UNK> martin <UNK> king by the time this film was made but if not it wasn't very long afterward that it started br br as i said at the outset this is pretty good entertainment but it should be viewed as the <UNK> <UNK> that it is
<START> many of the reviewers have made it a point to note that <UNK> is unlike the run of the mill films produced in bollywood while this is true bollywood films in general are <UNK> to a specific audience and should be appreciated for <UNK> their aims in this regard br br however <UNK> is an excellent film for those seeking a change from the normal <UNK> based bollywood film set during the time of <UNK> between india and <UNK> <UNK> focuses on a <UNK> girl who becomes the victim of societal and cultural attitudes toward the treatment of women in her time <UNK> the protagonist is forced to choose between a life with a man who has <UNK> her and the fleeting hope of a life with her family back in indian ruled <UNK> more than an issue of <UNK> and muslims <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> a woman's role as a daughter as a wife and as a mother in india and <UNK> in <UNK> unlike typical bollywood films which are <UNK> in nature <UNK> is a film that makes its audience contemplate these issues during and after the film
<START> <UNK> has it that when the <UNK> technical <UNK> to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or work crew the <UNK> you are not going to get in the <UNK> furthermore space <UNK> camp is in <UNK> not florida br br the truth is everyone on earth will win multi billion dollar <UNK> <UNK> before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> regarding access to <UNK> <UNK> br br this is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop
<START> every second of the film is gorgeous and that's why it earns a 7 because the plot is not especially <UNK> and thinking back over the last 90 minutes i never really felt any excitement or investment in the characters if anything the <UNK> graphics and framing have made certain scenes the car chase for instance more pedestrian than they ought to be not that they don't look lovely and have some very original design and occasionally novel camera angles but they are missing the <UNK> movement and close up shots that are part of the language for any normal action thriller the first hour <UNK> along and the dialogue feels very edited and a bit <UNK> people wait for each other to finish and don't always react in a natural <UNK> which would be a problem of recording each <UNK> dialogue <UNK> on rare occasions the emotions in the voices don't quite match those on screen something that should really have been avoided the futuristic architecture is very attractive lots of glass walls <UNK> screens lovely smoke <UNK> special effects and nice looking cars but again it's more an exercise in graphic design having no real impact on the story i'd argue that the whole point of using drawn animation instead of actors cgi is to really push the limits of imagination and design to do that which is too difficult <UNK> in other <UNK> although the animation in renaissance is certainly stunning and incredibly well accomplished i never felt like i was seeing something that hasn't been done before br br <UNK> another french cgi film also suffers from an <UNK> of beauty over story pace to be fair some marvellous and engaging french movies also have a <UNK> pace and lingering shots of the look in someone's eyes or the rain on paris <UNK> can evoke great emotion but animators need to understand that while animation brings unique strengths it also has weaknesses when compared to real life technique perhaps it would break from the <UNK> rules that the film wants to stick to but i think the film makers also missed a glaring opportunity to explore their future society a bit more the social <UNK> the <UNK> grip of the <UNK> etc br br i have no problem <UNK> renaissance to anybody who enjoys <UNK> design and or animation <UNK> fans in particular but i wouldn't make my other film loving friends sit through it take away the <UNK> visuals and it's a barely average film
<START> if this movie were more about <UNK> <UNK> character and less about the bar this might have been halfway decent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and karen friendly adventures of rocky and <UNK> both have a virgin <UNK> teacher quality to them that's endearing here's hoping she'll find a better movie to be in
<START> i believe i received this film when i was a young buck i remembered watching it as a child but i could never find the film i remembered good <UNK> <UNK> ann andy <UNK> the greedy king <UNK> <UNK> i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it we were reunited i am 17 years old now i still watch it all the time actually it's one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time and personally i think they should make a sequel <UNK> yes a sequel indeed now i am even considering getting the <UNK> bird <UNK> somewhere on my body
<START> maria <UNK> is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very <UNK> despite being so <UNK> as to border on <UNK> she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless <UNK> and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the <UNK> exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly <UNK> with the <UNK> familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with <UNK> then i woke <UNK> it is also book ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i've ever seen but don't let any of that put you off
<START> larry <UNK> has the distinct feeling he's missing out on something ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship he's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot then one night his car breaks down again walking into the nearest bar to wait for the <UNK> truck larry happens upon <UNK> mike who <UNK> to larry is about to change his life for ever br br the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing <UNK> back to the likes of it's a wonderful life and showing no signs of <UNK> with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click it's a genre that has produced very mixed results back in 1990 was this james belushi led production rarely mentioned when the said topic <UNK> it appears that it has largely been forgotten which is a shame since it <UNK> charm and is not short in the humour department we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end but it's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was i mean if his style of smart <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> isn't your thing then chances are you would avoid this film anyway but for those engaged by the likes of red heat k 9 and taking care of business well mr destiny is right up your street along for the ride are linda hamilton michael caine jon <UNK> hart <UNK> jay o sanders <UNK> russo and <UNK> cox br br mr destiny pure <UNK> fun with a <UNK> of a message at its heart 7 10
<START> rich alcoholic robert stack falls in love with secretary lauren bacall he marries her and is so happy he stops drinking however bacall is secretly loved by <UNK> best friend rock hudson and <UNK> <UNK> sister dorothy malone <UNK> after rock throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control in a good way br br very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw dropping fashions and <UNK> check out <UNK> hotel room at the beginning everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful form fitting clothes basically this is a soap opera with grade a production values the story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top the acting by hudson stack and bacall isn't that good but seeing them so young and glamorous is great especially stack when he <UNK> my knees went weak dorothy malone on the other hand is fantastic she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role she's sexy violent vicious and sympathetic all convincingly br br fun glossy trash don't miss it
<START> while the kiss of the spider woman cast <UNK> julia as a political prisoner in an <UNK> latin american country this time he works for a dictator in a fictional latin american country specifically the dictator suddenly drops dead so julia <UNK> el <UNK> with a broadway actor richard dreyfuss shooting a movie in the country from there dreyfuss has to figure out how to be a dictator all the while <UNK> it with his own life br br is it appropriate to turn the tense situation in latin america into comedy well moon over <UNK> does a good job with it no matter what they do in this movie they pull it off it just goes to show why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actors of our era and what we lost when <UNK> julia died definitely worth seeing also starring <UNK> <UNK> who co starred with <UNK> julia in <UNK> jonathan winters and sammy davis jr br br i agree the first lady is hot
<START> perhaps i would have liked this film more if i wasn't so attached to the characters in henry fool to those who've never seen henry fool i wouldn't worry as hartley <UNK> said in his introduction to the film at <UNK> the film has lots of exposition and explanations br br this film is very heavy in plot which keeps the film moving there are many humorous moments and the film certainly has hartley's trademark humour and rhythm of dialogue over all a technically well made film and sure to satisfy new fans of hartley who are just beginning explore his work as for the older fans who loved his earlier works like trust and amateur this film could go either way i have mixed feelings about the film and hartley's later films in general what hartley does best is setting his stories in small situations focusing on the intimate and <UNK> ways in which his characters interact with each other since his late 90s and <UNK> his films have <UNK> in scope in terms of subject matter mass media in no such thing religion in the book of life and now terrorism in fay grim i don't know if hartley's talents are suited to such big subject matter or if he's able to do it justice br br strangely enough the film can still be reduced to intimate relationships a simple love story about a woman who goes to seek out the husband she loves the only problem is i've seen henry fool and everyone seems incredibly out of character in this film you can tell this film was written long after henry fool was finished without any intention of a sequel somehow the terrorist plot feels conveniently tacked on through the use of <UNK> books of <UNK> as a <UNK> in the <UNK> sense <UNK> motivations for finding henry seemed motivated purely by the needs of the plot rather than what being faithful to who fay was as person in henry fool br br i guess i'm slightly disappointed in the film because it's not true to the characters in the henry fool and it doesn't exactly work as a straight ahead thriller there's too much irony and <UNK> in hartley's approach to such as big topic as terrorism it somehow works and doesn't work at the same time all i could say you would either love or hate the film depending on your take on hartley's work and how well you know hartley's work fans of henry fool be severely warned for a disappointment for the rest welcome to the world of hal hartley and enjoy the ride
<START> with all of the films of recent dealing with the british <UNK> is it really time for another answer you bet the young victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from britain dealing with the royal family in this case it deals with the early life of princess victoria and events leading up to the <UNK> of her becoming queen of all england as well as her romance eventual wedding to prince albert the film also deals with the <UNK> lives careers of both <UNK> queen prince as well as several other events that <UNK> political turmoil etc emily blunt plays a <UNK> victoria in her youth while rupert friend is her beloved best friend prince albert the rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of miranda richardson as the <UNK> of kent and the always welcome on screen jim <UNK> as king william as well as a cast of others that shine on screen jean marc <UNK> c r a z y loser love directs from a winning screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> vanity fair <UNK> park separate lies i absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look by cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> who gave each frame of film a <UNK> look with the help of production designer <UNK> <UNK> as well as some tight editing by jill <UNK> matt garner what i also appreciated in <UNK> script is the use of a game of chess as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a chess board this is smart well written directed filmed edited acted entertainment and enlightenment that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema rated pg by the mpaa for a few scenes of <UNK> some brief violence a little bloody although nothing too gory a rude <UNK> of language and some on screen smoking
<START> this is a excellent series you will laugh you will cry these wonderful people will be a part of your family the way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets a great example of the way we should live our lives there are many good things they do and a number of bad choices but they never turn their backs on family they work through problems michelle the youngest daughter is the <UNK> thing i've seen stephanie the middle daughter suffers with middle child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family it's better dj the oldest daughter is growing up whether her dad wants it to happen or not one thing they all share is they miss their mom danny dad joey and uncle jesse love these kids so much and it's apparent in every episode
<START> the only thing that frequently pops into my head while i'm writing this review is i'll never get that hour and a half back to indicate that i'm not just blowing air i'll compare the movie to the other movies of the cube trilogy cube and <UNK> cube wasn't great but it was original and that made up for some technical flaws <UNK> as a sequel lost the advantage of originality but it came out looking pretty sharp and i even liked it <UNK> than cube the story was better but cube zero in comparison to it's predecessors really isn't worth sh t a complete lack of good fx a very f <UNK> d up script and just plain old bad acting don't combine well example all of the time during the movie i was thinking it would be incredibly stupid if should happen and then it would happen so it's not very original neither my advice don't lose that hour and a half i lost oh and i hope this movie crashes and burns
<START> this is a <UNK> shallow naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between <UNK> psychotic film editor and harold his vapid girlfriend the two have zero chemistry together primarily because harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career but also because <UNK> character is neither interesting nor likeable there are 15 static excruciating minutes at the beginning where brooks having just broke up with harold stumbles about his apartment in a depressed drugged out state unbearable br br <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> by joe <UNK> you are so beautiful there simply is not enough material here for a feature film there is hardly anything going on on the <UNK> of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world i'm sure <UNK> intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and in a way <UNK> it but if you're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here
<START> as much as i have enjoyed the hanzo the razor movies three is definitely enough <UNK> got the gold ' the final adventure for the japanese <UNK> with the impressive package is a fairly enjoyable piece of <UNK> cinema but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as <UNK> is concerned br br the film opens with the appearance of a female ghost and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction unfortunately after the <UNK> turns out to be nothing but a scooby doo style <UNK> <UNK> up by a corrupt <UNK> official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold director <UNK> <UNK> is content to <UNK> familiar elements from the first two films the result being a rather stale affair br br once again hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to <UNK> women through the use of his mighty penis slice up his enemies and abuse his superiors on the way we get wild <UNK> good natured rape hanzo forces himself on women who wind up <UNK> his <UNK> and bloody sword fights br br if you've already seen and appreciated the first two films you might as well watch this <UNK> to complete the set but be warned this is probably the least satisfying one of them all br br 6 5 out of 10 rounded up to 7 for imdb
<START> a damsel in distress is a delight because of the great gershwin songs fred astaire joan fontaine and a terrific supporting cast headed by <UNK> allen and george burns br br typically silly plot for an astaire film has him as an american dance star in england with burns as his <UNK> and allen his secretary they <UNK> a story about his being a love bug with women falling victim to him left and right he runs into fontaine who is being held captive in her castle by a <UNK> aunt and <UNK> father silly plot br br the great songs include a <UNK> day things are looking up nice work if you can get it and i can't be bothered now fontaine does not sing but does a brief and decent number with astaire surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with astaire are burns and allen including an inventive and fun romp through an amusement park br br also in the cast are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> love harry watson as albert ray noble and my favorite jan <UNK> as the lead <UNK> singer br br jan <UNK> is in the middle of the <UNK> trio who sings nice work if you can get it her facial expressions are hilarious she was also a scene <UNK> in the w c fields comedy the old fashioned way playing <UNK> <UNK> br br much abuse has been <UNK> on this film because of the absence of ginger rogers who as noted elsewhere would have been <UNK> miscast the tcm host notes that ruby keeler and jessie <UNK> were considered <UNK> two more would be disasters fontaine is fine as <UNK> and the dynamic allows the musical numbers to belong to astaire with ample comic relief by burns and allen br br fun film great songs good cast and jan <UNK> in a rare spotlight
<START> this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues it's full of emotion and the direction is done well the storyline progresses very quickly but i guess that's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy
<START> valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list think halloween friday the 13th scream and i know what you did last summer it certainly isn't as good as those movies that i have listed about but it's better than most of the <UNK> that came out after the first friday the 13th film one of those films was the 1981 canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but it's not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is <UNK> and <UNK> by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then they're picked off one by one the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jessica <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they do what they can with the material they've got but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however br br out of four
<START> i loved this <UNK> republic serial the story was one of the best i have ever seen even tough the picture quality was not of the best but ok the <UNK> in this serial is also a bit bad but not terrible they only should have <UNK> some more as i said the story is great you're just sitting there and waiting to find out who don del <UNK> is the theme music is excellent it's the same guy who maid the music for walt disney's version of zorro who maid the <UNK> legion music costumes and buildings are very good zorro is really cool and so are the <UNK> i highly recommend this serial buy it br br i love that reed hadley plays zorro he is funny smart and brave mark 6
<START> offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so called fire starters think stephen king's <UNK> fest of a book with the same name but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a <UNK> good special effects especially towards the end quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make wilder <UNK> a unique treat of a film to watch if you can find it that is on a personal note i was fortunate enough to snatch it up so to speak from the two dollar bin at my local video rental store out of
<START> this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the <UNK> eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i don't like is i can't get it on tape i've tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it
<START> this film isn't just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the <UNK> shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors busy phillips erika christensen and victor <UNK> are excellent in their roles i highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it <UNK> discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tear <UNK> but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
<START> in the same vein as natural born killers another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved kalifornia is a movie that clearly <UNK> violence but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act kind of like how the basketball <UNK> <UNK> drugs at first but shows the bad side by the end of the movie which is far worse than the good side is good david duchovny plays brian <UNK> an artistic <UNK> with an even more artistically <UNK> girlfriend who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for i don't know where places where nudity passes for art maybe it really does and i just don't understand it at any rate brian and carrie duchovny and michelle forbes who fits the role <UNK> make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites brian the writer will write the book carrie can take the pictures br br being artistic types brian and carrie are not quite <UNK> prepared for such a trip so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel <UNK> and are <UNK> by early grace and adele <UNK> brad pitt and juliette lewis early is on <UNK> and assigned to <UNK> work at the local university by his <UNK> officer sees the ad on a <UNK> board and decides to leave the state for a while <UNK> his <UNK> but also leaving the scene of his <UNK> murder so he won't have to deal with a <UNK> murder investigation two birds with one stone you know br br the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes the artsy <UNK> and the <UNK> trailer trash without <UNK> to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type brian and carrie are artsy <UNK> but while carrie catches on to early and adele brian is fascinated with <UNK> status as an outlaw as seen in the scene where brian shoots <UNK> gun never having fired a gun before he's as fascinated as a little kid while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her <UNK> way as the fact that early broke her of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink early doesn't think women should early and brian are out at the local bar brian <UNK> <UNK> to a drunk trying to start a fight with him and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and <UNK> out a quick lesson for the guy hit him <UNK> it's <UNK> this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie partly because it's so funny what early <UNK> says as the guy's friends drag him away <UNK> and <UNK> but also because as it is <UNK> with the girls back at the hotel we learn so much all at once about the two couples their differences and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them and besides that because brian <UNK> from <UNK> actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele br br clearly by now you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer but on the other hand it's a great way to <UNK> the <UNK> of murder that is inherent within a cross country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes while studying the actions of past murderers brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying and realize that murder is not as pretty or <UNK> fascinating when it's in your face as it is through <UNK> studies of murders past br br i am constantly amazed at brad <UNK> <UNK> as an actor consider for example his roles in movies like kalifornia 12 monkeys fight club and <UNK> 11 and 12 pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character and is completely believable incidentally i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year but just couldn't get the hair and beard right i even got the hat right which initially i thought would be the hardest part br br it's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it <UNK> violence and murder but i think that whatever <UNK> it does is done with the intention of <UNK> the audience's understanding of its subject matter a film that didn't <UNK> violence at least initially could never be as effective as kalifornia but the movie <UNK> it perfectly the <UNK> is all <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> fascination with the idea of murder and the <UNK> of the places in which is happened but their realization and <UNK> is <UNK> in the real thing which they encounter with early and adele the movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between <UNK> violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real
<START> this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop ram <UNK> <UNK> first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie sholay but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and i guess leave all the good parts of the movie acting script songs music comedy action etc out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew waste of money waste of time after making movies like <UNK> <UNK> and company he pulled a coppola godfather on us what were you thinking <UNK> anyways the story is though hard to follow is almost like the old sholay ajay <UNK> playing <UNK> <UNK> sholay and ajay new kid on the block playing ajay jay sholay both bad yet funny friends help a cop capture a bad guy first later in the movie now retired cop hires them as personal security and <UNK> from the hands of a very most wanted <UNK> played by amitabh <UNK> in case you haven't been watching bollywood movies the good guys win in the end there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life
<START> pathetic this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to br br the intentions were good great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions but the performance damn i swear in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear action the battle scenes are so bad you wonder are these people for real they could've done more damage just by <UNK> each other in the slow mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing waving their hands br br only action in the <UNK> is somehow <UNK> but for what the story is so illogical and <UNK> it seems like random situations in <UNK> order sometimes not even that the dialogs are dumb the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies br br with a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen in best case scenario the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser <UNK> in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is an excellent private <UNK> cartoon that warns against <UNK> panic inducing <UNK> during wartime produced as were all the <UNK> shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining <UNK> films <UNK> is extremely imaginative and <UNK> tons of ideas into its very brief <UNK> when <UNK> starts a <UNK> about a bombing it <UNK> into an eventual <UNK> that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long <UNK> piece of <UNK> and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt <UNK> with ever more terrible news about his country's military <UNK> is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to <UNK> the rather <UNK> don't <UNK> the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private <UNK> shorts
<START> the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions the movie re <UNK> your faith in love and pain of <UNK> the joy of seeing your most beloved is <UNK> and anything can be sacrificed ethan and julie have <UNK> eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love by far the most romantic at least one of them movie of all times
<START> this film is like <UNK> you either love it or you hate it if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values a good plot and great characters you'll hate it if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you'll probably hate it br br if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it john <UNK> is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane murderous coke fiend br br the special effects are abysmal at best but really who cares if you're the kind of person who's prepared to watch a film <UNK> the whore <UNK> you've undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would've mediocre at best i'd much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be <UNK> by the mediocre br br to sum it up you'll probably hate this film but if you're one of the few who decide to see it anyway it'll become the best thing since <UNK> bread 2 i hate <UNK>
<START> the quote i used for my summary occurs about halfway through the good earth as a captain of a chinese revolutionary army played by philip <UNK> <UNK> to a mob for not having time to shoot more of the <UNK> among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines of course the next <UNK> about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl o <UNK> for whose portrayal <UNK> rainer now 99 years old won her second <UNK> best actress oscar br br the next scene finds o <UNK> <UNK> delivering her bag of <UNK> <UNK> to her under <UNK> husband farmer wang lung paul muni setting in motion that classic <UNK> of a man's <UNK> financial <UNK> being the direct <UNK> of his moral decline br br for a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> home invasion eating family pets mental <UNK> <UNK> exploited <UNK> <UNK> civil war summary mass street <UNK> <UNK> child beating adultery incest and <UNK> <UNK> of biblical proportions the good earth is a surprisingly heart warming movie br br my <UNK> thought is in the form of another classic quote from o <UNK> herself while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband wang lung had <UNK> tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their <UNK> meat is meat
<START> just picked this up on dvd and watched it again i love the bright colors vs dark imagery not a big beatty fan but this is an excellent popcorn movie pacino is astounding as always and well this movie marked the period where madonna was her absolute <UNK> i wish she had stuck with the breathless look for a while longer charlie <UNK> first really big role other than what about bob the makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment the cars wardrobe buildings and even the <UNK> et a great tone not to mention the perfect lighting although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying as it tends to <UNK> a little just wish beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel all in all a fun few hours
<START> in one word abysmal i give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women otherwise forget it <UNK> worst effort bar none ben <UNK> should have had his name <UNK> stricken from the cast i cannot believe that this is now going to be on dvd as of 2 15 <UNK> with wild in the streets another retro stinker i woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some <UNK> the digital channels the premise looked interesting enough because i like viewing b movie sci fi hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks it seemed familiar somehow and with ben <UNK> in the cast i thought why not what a big mistake it was a horrible start to my day br br only after viewing it i now know why the <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> of my newly <UNK> brain i remembered seeing coming <UNK> for this film as a 14 year old i'm 45 back in the early mid seventies at the <UNK> a local art theater that no longer exists the whole theater laughed hysterically and even <UNK> out loud at how bad this movie looked acting dreadful story awful cinematography nearly awful music terrible sound horrendous directing a joke if you choose to watch this after my warning remember i told you so br br <UNK> s s s is the perfect title for this film you feel <UNK> after viewing this <UNK> movie or maybe that you should be taken to a gas chamber for wasting your brain away i have seen <UNK> super 8 movies that put this film to shame definitely a new addition to my all time top ten worst films it's up there er down there with <UNK> br br ted in gilbert <UNK>
<START> an <UNK> garde nightmarish extremely low budget film that has <UNK> of <UNK> hard to sit through i get the message that child abuse is wrong wow big revelation i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this yes that's sarcasm don't watch this film if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender don't watch it if you're the least bit <UNK> don't watch it if you care about acting on second thought just don't watch it period br br my grade d br br dvd extras making the movie the premiere interview with <UNK> <UNK> deleted scenes movie stills director's commentary 2 versions of the <UNK> trailer music video by the <UNK> a <UNK> video experiment
<START> this is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the entire movie br br it's a quite intriguing dramatic story with also romance present in it the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors normally i'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good br br of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies produced in the west in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era br br i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better for a movie that is considered a kind of an art house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite <UNK> not that this is a bad thing it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre br br but oh well this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint br br 8 10
<START> what an amazing film with very little dialogue the whole story is told with <UNK> and body language very involving almost <UNK> my only <UNK> is that it has not been released on video in australia and is therefore only available on tv what a waste
<START> <UNK> <UNK> magical lyrical novel about three generations of an <UNK> south american family was <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of a movie that resulted largely due to a magnificent cast of <UNK> actors completely unable to carry off the <UNK> latin <UNK> of <UNK> characters and a plodding <UNK> directorial hand was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion to my disappointment i had not missed a thing none among meryl streep jeremy <UNK> glenn close and vanessa redgrave could <UNK> free of the trap set for them by director <UNK> august all of them looked perfectly stiff and <UNK> as if by putting forth as little effort as possible they expected to fade <UNK> into lovely period sets yes the film was art directed within an inch of its life curious that the production designer was <UNK> the <UNK> of placing <UNK> products <UNK> in a scene that occurs circa 1970 years before <UNK> came into being back then it was known by its original name kentucky fried chicken even <UNK> that what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military <UNK> in south america in 1970 american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s the house of the spirits should have been the motion picture event of 1993 because it was so club <UNK> and <UNK> faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented <UNK> had to market it as an art film as a result it was neither event nor art and for that <UNK> <UNK> should have pressed charges for rape
<START> <UNK> a k a alien visitor is not what i expected this is a no budget australian film with no special effects other than <UNK> up film and quick scene cuts the female alien who comes over immediately able to speak perfectly <UNK> australian can <UNK> from place to place or time to time and alter her perception of the flow of time to match the faster humans br br an elderly grandmother tells her two <UNK> about a story a wandering man told her 40 years before when an <UNK> she came to the planet naked and completely <UNK> unable to recognize which star in the sky she came from she meets a man alone camping in the australian <UNK> apparently <UNK> him she is here by mistake and gets angry when she is told she is on earth the <UNK> are known as <UNK> <UNK> of the environment and a metaphor for the most insulting thing imaginable to the rest of the universe those who breathe the foul air but do nothing about it sticking their heads under the sand like an <UNK> in another amusing metaphor <UNK> are <UNK> br br from there it is entirely a film about dialogue as the <UNK> man tries to understand she's peculiar psychology and <UNK> even as she calls him <UNK> and quaint the man begins to realize maybe it's humans who are irrational and not thinking straight yet while waiting to be <UNK> up back home she sees that this human is not entirely <UNK> in his thinking and even falls in love with him br br the dialogue about perspectives is in spots interesting but it is all layered with a heavy handed <UNK> message and a low budget feel there are only two main actors who <UNK> around various deserted scenes and the evil <UNK> humans on the planet are never seen at all the <UNK> message offers no <UNK> but paints one or two dire <UNK> about what will happen to nature and man if something isn't done the logic also doesn't hang together the rest of the universe has given up on earth yet one space woman caught on earth by mistake manages to effect some positive change by the conclusion of the movie what would a <UNK> of aliens deliberately sent here manage to achieve against <UNK> and waste
<START> in my book basic instinct was a perfect film it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone douglas and all the supporting actors to the <UNK> role it had marvelous photography music and the <UNK> noir script ever all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get br br this sequel is the exact opposite it cannot possibly get worse bad acting and a lame script combined with totally inept direction this is really bad boring annoying the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re <UNK> copy of the original these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself because it was like watching the <UNK> of a shining <UNK> the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the <UNK> of the jerry <UNK> score of <UNK> michael <UNK> jones and the half wit responsible for the script even included the there is no smoking in this room dialog in the <UNK> scene and yes she sends her attorney who is now a <UNK> away br br i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made it does damage to the original so bad is it the only redeeming value is the realization that <UNK> surgery and i am sure ms stone <UNK> the best surgeon money can buy can do a good job but can obviously not <UNK> the perfection of the original and what concerns the human body applies to film making too there should be a law don't ever make a sequel to a perfect film
<START> just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed lindsay <UNK> and the rest of the cast just as much as before it just keeps getting better and better you simply have to marvel at the carefully <UNK> way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place br br truly one of the great ones and definitely my all time favourite
<START> i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say it's one of the worst films i've ever seen the acting is fair but the plot is totally ridiculous a killer is born because of all the energy used to make the movie and if the film is burned the killer will die how unbelievable is that the characters were underdeveloped to say the least for example all of a sudden the man mentions aren't you trying to complete the film because your mother couldn't so we're supposed to go along with this we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film the movie really didn't spotlight on anyone we didn't know anything about the main people who survived except <UNK> character was a <UNK> actress the guy was on the set when the people died and <UNK> wanted to be a director like her mother not truly diving in to know who they are seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making i can't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture it's not funny it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film i found myself <UNK> what would happen before each scene which believe you me wasn't hard at all to do it's a disgrace and i'm deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess 1 10
<START> i purchased this film for 5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only chase masterson but i should have <UNK> up the five thrown it in a toilet and <UNK> the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that <UNK> in high school and reunite on the <UNK> of their idiot friends death who got drunk and <UNK> into the woods and died there problem is a <UNK> monster is hunting them down one by one the acting is abysmal these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like <UNK> and <UNK> creek the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old the entire set looks like someone's backyard in <UNK> the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and or actors avoid this pile of garbage at all costs
<START> bend it like beckham is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and <UNK> and dealt a lot with football soccer here which some may have trouble relating too in the u s it's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here i think the basis of the storyline following a dream is something many people can relate to and in the end bend it like beckham proves to be a good feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner i highly recommend this movie
<START> to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing it also show's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time like how hard it was for <UNK> to get on a plane and how he used words like blow up or <UNK> saying we'll blow away the competition and people took it the wrong way being a muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq its not right things are not like that people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act i am glad a show like this came on the air there are many shows that <UNK> muslim people as terrorists many people do find them funny to my <UNK> it is ok to do it now and then because <UNK> much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair but it is done to often and really gives <UNK> people a bad name
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was <UNK> into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it now i want to punch jason <UNK> in the face for taking this role i was physically ill after watching this film i really don't understand hollywood sometimes there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can <UNK> off the top and get the very best that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to <UNK> <UNK> instead of this <UNK> the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off <UNK> commercials added to the <UNK> of the film glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost
<START> this is not a bad film it is not wildly funny but it is interesting and br br entertaining it has a few funny moments cher gives a good br br performance in a role that is very opposite her real life self her br br performance alone is worth the watch if this movie had come out br br today it would not have been nominated but by '80s standards it br br was excellent
<START> this film was totally not what i expected br br if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two br br its really strange because i cannot see the point the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense the don't even match maybe i am naive but ain't a <UNK> 1 <UNK> 2 meant to match up br br carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail br br the plot was ok but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film br br i really expected it to end like the other one started br br if some one has a opinion on this post it please
<START> a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the <UNK> heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror and bad things naturally occur as a result br br if this film had been made just a decade later i am sure i wouldn't have been so <UNK> in reviewing and <UNK> this film after all the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is at times a bit stilted however when you consider that in <UNK> full length films were rare and often only 20 to 30 minutes long plus the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual as stories were very short and <UNK> acted so given the limitations of the time this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known
<START> playwright sidney <UNK> michael caine has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit he receives a play written by a student of his <UNK> anderson christopher reeve which is fantastic it's so good sidney says he would kill for it will he br br a thinking man's thriller it was originally a play and it shows it's mostly on one set and all talk but i was never bored it's very well written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force caine is just great as <UNK> another one of his great performances reeve is surprisingly very good i never thought much of him as an actor but he's really good in this role <UNK> cannon does wonders with an <UNK> role as <UNK> wife irene worth is also good and quite funny as <UNK> ten drop a psychic however her accent did get on my nerves director sidney lumet does very well with his one set the camera is always moving and keeps your attention going br br extreme spoiler dead ahead my only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging <UNK> and it also contains one of the most <UNK> kisses i've ever seen but these are mild complaints br br a very good thriller critics hate this movie for some reason and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982 that's too bad it deserves better
<START> these were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom first i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that then reaching <UNK> minute i was convincing myself that it's only a few more minutes and i lasted to the very end which i'm kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for <UNK> patience and crap tolerance was it worth watching at all well as i wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if you're strong <UNK> enough you may even last to the end the movie lacks <UNK> and characters seem to have no common sense at all all happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel
<START> bad movie saw it at the <UNK> and the movie gives me a sense of <UNK> there done <UNK> it reminds me alot of the movie blow expect the blow was actually interesting br br this one story told two ways and both times it is not told that well br br
<START> a strange mix of traditional 80s <UNK> chevy chase type every ten lines you get a funny one farce and <UNK> black comedy mildly amusing in spots but utterly tasteless there is a <UNK> sequence that includes the <UNK> looking back <UNK> since on her <UNK> secret service
<START> this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors corey and danny are <UNK> annoying corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to <UNK> false promises br br <UNK> campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film danny dean <UNK> looks in his late thirties and the girl he's trying to bed corey looks as if she's still in college br br here in australia this film is called too smooth there is nothing smooth about this film at all 1 10 avoid
<START> i'll have to add <UNK> comment here various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i e one of the admirable <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> that have come our way in recent years unfortunately this isn't quite accurate the film plays out rather like a film school <UNK> attempt to <UNK> these masters all the pieces are there the beautiful backdrop the vaguely <UNK> dialogue the slow <UNK> <UNK> and male leads in particular who spend a fair <UNK> of time sitting around being <UNK> sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par the dialogue is <UNK> the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and <UNK> unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical <UNK> i e very predictable plot the results are at best tedious and at worst painful i couldn't help but see the blue <UNK> river scene for example as <UNK> on genre parody although the <UNK> looking <UNK> sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li <UNK> was <UNK> it while the setting is elegant and the <UNK> camera attempts to <UNK> the mood of flowers of shanghai the film is not in the same league visually in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my <UNK> for dinner and took the chance to leave and i can't recall the last film i walked out of i'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive <UNK> but by that point i couldn't care if you'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i'd recommend anything by the above two directors for example in the mood for love or flowers of shanghai both of which were filmed by the talented mr <UNK> the former with chris doyle and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed <UNK> like this it's not often mr <UNK> leads me <UNK> and perhaps you'd rather listen to him but don't say you weren't warned craig br br
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date the best part was christian j <UNK> leonard attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar kind of like i wanted to do on the dvd to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this <UNK> film it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good i mean with sean <UNK> andrew played his part perfectly did a great job too bad it was in this film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ron <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> poet they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie br br if the cast had any dignity they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer director george <UNK> and writer john <UNK>
<START> i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a writer director i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr hopkins falls into this category of all the movies i have ever seen in my 50 years this is absolutely the worst movie ever please do us all a favor mr hopkins and stick to acting which you are excellent at and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would
<START> this is a kind of genre thing meaning you either like the 1950s musicals or you don't if you do you'll love this personally i prefer the 1930s and most of the <UNK> musicals with the dancing talents of astaire and rogers and <UNK> powell bill robinson ruby keeler james cagney shirley temple and so forth but the songs of the <UNK> the slower dance numbers and the <UNK> <UNK> of the decade all turn me off br br this film is a case in point the first song was okay but the next three did nothing for me by then the story didn't have much appeal either the presence of deborah kerr is another minus i don't think i've seen a movie she starred in that i liked including this one where the <UNK> two shoes english teacher she portrays spends half the movie threatening to leave <UNK> i which she had br br however <UNK> myself from likes and <UNK> there is no denying this rogers and <UNK> production has a lot of appeal to many folks particularly those who liked the sound of music a decade later there are similarities in the r h musicals thus if you liked the julie andrews flick you should like this too br br this is a lavish production with yes a capital l this is the kind of big production musicals you rarely saw after that generation you also get the dubbed singers unlike today where the actress isn't able to really sing so <UNK> <UNK> comes to rescue of kerr as she did with natalie wood in west side story and audrey hepburn in my fair lady br br <UNK> <UNK> is king <UNK> and is the stereotypical <UNK> the kind filmmakers always portray in a negative way he isn't <UNK> as the left <UNK> like the say but the education teacher kerr as anna <UNK> will set him straight <UNK> <UNK> of today always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer however <UNK> is good in this role and even employs some comedy along with his more <UNK> than bite character <UNK> he is the big star of this film <UNK> had <UNK> even in the magnificent seven <UNK> was the one cowboy who <UNK> the audience br br in summary it's a fine movie for its day and millions of people enjoyed it i'll leave it at that
<START> johnny dangerously is a sort of hit and miss comedy that has it's laughs and huh but i suggest to give it a chance i think it is greatly over looked not too many people give this movie a chance it does work just think of it as a little parody of <UNK> michael keaton is very funny in his role and he does it well johnny dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life he just works his way up from the big bosses to a beautiful wife and of course like a lot of the mob movies someone wants him dead 90 of the jokes get a laugh like i said give it a chance just take your <UNK> gangster movies and mix a comedy in you have johnny dangerously br br 7 10
<START> i have always enjoyed the pokemon movies yes i know all of them are very corny mediocre in some certain areas and sure even though they're aimed at little kids they're too adult in some fields to be able to guard them with the statement hey <UNK> up it's a kids movie but all that aside aren't they still good pieces of entertainment in my opinion they are so and i enjoy them greatly this one is just as enjoyable as the previous three and certainly <UNK> it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable fresh pokemon <UNK> it's not the best pokemon movie but i do enjoy it more than the third installment even though the third is not bad and the entire series is just entertaining harmless popcorn family fun and should be considered nothing more nothing less this film has some high marks of intensity and interest especially around the climax ending as do all the <UNK> and the characters while a bit more lackluster than the previous three i thought are still likable and humorous this films is the lowest rated and most criticized of the four feature length <UNK> and it doesn't deserve that
<START> okay so the previews to this film only tells you that a rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer in order to <UNK> out that is actually not the case it's about a young rebellious 17 year old girl who reveals a secret and it's up to her mother to believe if she's telling the truth or not br br to be honest i really enjoyed the concept of this movie they had a really good plot and a really good theme of a love hate relationship between mother and daughter i did not however enjoyed watching lindsay <UNK> acting in reality this movie would have been great if they had someone else perhaps a better actress the character of rachel <UNK> is a very sexually aggressive person and it sort of reminds us of the real lindsay so it takes away a lot from the film br br i do however think that if you put lindsay aside you will enjoy this film the ending is pretty great and sad
<START> breaking glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once it is a very dark tale about the way a record company <UNK> a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible looking at some of today's <UNK> for a <UNK> style tv shows on both in the uk and abroad i am always reminded of this film though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there this film <UNK> these shows though the effect seems the same after getting rid of her manager played quite brilliantly by phil daniels slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on <UNK> and she is eventually totally burnt out you potential stars of tomorrow watch this and beware
<START> for the love of god please don't see this movie its a waste of time the plot is predictable as are the romantic scenes trying to build too much with very little this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame the characters aren't developed and most of the film is padded out with shots of rome which is much more interesting than the actual film to top all of that the acting is a disgrace i know everyone tries to find their <UNK> but this is truly a disaster i can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen don't waste money or time on this film go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead
<START> to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart though it is a very different kind of film the conflict between scottish <UNK> and english <UNK> is front and center here as well roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set but some things never seemed to change <UNK> is still run by english <UNK> and the <UNK> never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them rob roy is <UNK> done but not the grand epic that braveheart was there are no large scale battles and the conflict here is more between individuals and <UNK> so not all <UNK> are portrayed as evil this time rob roy is simply a film about those with honor and those who are truly evil br br liam neeson plays the title character rob roy <UNK> he is the leader of the <UNK> clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local <UNK> of record known as the marquis of <UNK> john hurt things look pretty rough for the <UNK> clan as winter is approaching and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well being of his community sounds fair enough doesn't it problems <UNK> when two <UNK> of the marquis steal the money for themselves one of them known as <UNK> cunningham is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film played wonderfully by tim roth this man is a <UNK> would be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother this man is <UNK> <UNK> rude heartless and very dangerous with a sword he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility he rapes <UNK> wife and burns him out of his home this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come along with another <UNK> of the marquis brian cox cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own <UNK> though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened the marquis still holds <UNK> to the debt this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity br br spoilers ahead br br luckily for the <UNK> a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace and for most of the fight it looks like these attributes will win out just when it looks like rob roy is finished he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner the first time you see what happens you will probably be as shocked as cunningham rob roy is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and perfectly paced the score is quite memorable too the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange who might seem to be out of her element actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary <UNK> the film is violent but there isn't too much gore it is a <UNK> picture full of <UNK> behavior however the <UNK> are largely played as being amoral and sleazy the film has no obvious flaws thus it gets 10 of 10 stars br br the <UNK>
<START> amy <UNK> and rachel <UNK> are among the funnier women to have been on saturday night live it's unfortunate that they along with tina <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch making circa 2002 2006 the show has ever had still these two women most especially know what's funny and they know how to write a funny movie br br you'll notice in the credits of this movie that <UNK> and director ryan <UNK> wrote the story for spring breakdown but who wrote the actual screenplay <UNK> of dialogue and all the important fill in the blank material that makes a story into a <UNK> movie yep just <UNK> just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie and no women apparently wrote the script with him the result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that doesn't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as mtv does every year br br if <UNK> <UNK> and even co star parker posey could have contributed their <UNK> to the screenplay it would have been far less cliché the premise is original being about three thirty something women who were <UNK> in high school and apparently college too who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly <UNK> about i say allegedly because you never quite know what fun is to these characters they entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro woman <UNK> like true colors and spend their nights together holding make your own pizza parties even though none of them are especially unattractive the outside world appears to treat them like they are there's a scene where a blind student of <UNK> played by <UNK> real life husband will <UNK> asks her out on a date only to touch her face and immediately change his mind if <UNK> character is supposed to be unattractive they obviously hired the wrong actress br br the movie continues to show promise even though we have our doubts about the main characters when <UNK> boss texas senator <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jane lynch funny as always hires posey to watch over her <UNK> college age daughter <UNK> <UNK> playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie while she goes to a <UNK> beach like vacation spot for spring break <UNK> and <UNK> come along they reluctantly get <UNK> up party like they apparently should have when they were in college and then comes the ultimate showdown with the <UNK> <UNK> lead by sophie monk br br sophie monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons unfortunately her movie career is off to a rough start with the <UNK> unfunny date movie 2006 and the disappointing click 2006 here she plays a southern belle although her voice sounds like she stole <UNK> <UNK> voice box she <UNK> it up a little too much trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras br br spring breakdown was released straight to dvd despite the star power of amy <UNK> but rightly so because the story is way too cliché it may as well have been called national <UNK> spring breakdown and the magazine probably wouldn't have <UNK> for trademark <UNK> because of the free publicity if director <UNK> had given at least one woman the creative <UNK> especially rachel <UNK> this movie would have been great and not nearly as run of the mill as frat house comedies we've seen before i know <UNK> will come up with another funny concept and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself she's funny enough and she deserves better than this half baked comedy that would accept <UNK> brother with open arms
<START> often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills <UNK> more laughs out of the <UNK> code than it's seen since the days of <UNK> and jed <UNK> plot centers on two <UNK> who've bet on which one of them can bed his <UNK> both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy <UNK> and <UNK> first if <UNK> wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend br br lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface <UNK> is memorable as a very sensual <UNK> member of the family who ends up taking his sexy <UNK> niece on a year long <UNK> trip to africa br br hilarious fun
<START> this film is just a shame orlando florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area like <UNK> rise to <UNK> the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a <UNK> for the area which made great <UNK> with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon br br i will try to be as honest as possible i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers it had the potential to give a new spin on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after all both <UNK> and the <UNK> boys come from this area but the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script both lead characters are flat with almost no development part of this could be the <UNK> actors but some of it is certainly the way the script was written br br also a problem is the choice of jokes many of the jokes are too repetitive they do come off funny the first time but it does grow to be a bit boring some of the <UNK> scenes are staged poorly and many of these scenes also don't seem to move the story along in any way br br i had high hopes for this one but alas its a disappointing effort i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short but i think the best thing for filmmaker john <UNK> is to move to different genres quickly comedy isn't his strong suit but its <UNK> that he definitely is one of the more <UNK> filmmakers in the orlando area its just a shame that right now he's infamous not famous br br
<START> a pretty average movie but a brave one from ms hawn to promote this vehicle as <UNK> producer as a starring vehicle although she ends up <UNK> she is willing to portray herself as the <UNK> bimbo how many other a listed actresses have subjected themselves to butt injury <UNK> since this movie not many does this mean the female butt cannot be funny goldie surpasses other actresses as she has <UNK> a screen persona <UNK> in projects other won't sandra <UNK> occasionally goes there for example miss <UNK> but nicole kidman would never cop the <UNK> a wonderful performer great to see some of my favorite actors chris sarandon cliff <UNK> notably
<START> this is the movie that <UNK> the d d fear of the 80s and even today the fear being that people who play d d or any other role playing game for that matter will be sucked in and lose their ability to <UNK> reality from fantasy and go on killing <UNK> child sacrifices suicide etc great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on <UNK> objects but anyone who has played a role playing game a video game or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence it is to d d what <UNK> was to computers plus as a movie it just kinda sucks
<START> another too bad the lowest they can go here is one otherwise this would get an easy zero truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact were <UNK> name not on the thing i would never have guessed he did it actually one of the people in san francisco i know was on the set a lot and from nearly <UNK> on he says that sam was just plain <UNK> it shows in <UNK> the laughing bit at the early part of the film is the only thing in this entire mess worth a second look not even gig young is watchable this is a true test of <UNK> had i been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it i would have jumped up screaming and now i truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave what a mess it seemed less written than made up as they went along it's not only a bomb but a <UNK> spelled backwards <UNK>
<START> a very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies tarzan faces the greatest <UNK> without <UNK> if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his success the most <UNK> for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great <UNK> and had a great shout
<START> giallo fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low <UNK> that <UNK> these films i don't want to give anything away so i wont even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema for 15
<START> <UNK> is a strange strange film based on the novel <UNK> shall know them by <UNK> to <UNK> criticism at the film feels really <UNK> since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and <UNK> for <UNK> moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its <UNK> intentions and its well meaning tone <UNK> simply isn't a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan <UNK> later it <UNK> into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom <UNK> the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled <UNK> movie br br an <UNK> expedition into the <UNK> of new guinea is led by <UNK> douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main <UNK> involved in the <UNK> is attractive lady scientist dr <UNK> <UNK> susan clark after an <UNK> trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the <UNK> of early man  the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the <UNK> call the tribe the <UNK> and are initially thrilled by the <UNK> of their discovery but things take a devastating turn when nasty <UNK> <UNK> paul <UNK> declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their <UNK> on behalf of <UNK> he questions whether the <UNK> are truly human and takes his argument to the <UNK> where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued br br this was a very early film in <UNK> career and he actually <UNK> this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role asked to play a charming <UNK> who really belongs in a tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark <UNK> much better as the earnest lady <UNK> and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and <UNK> hyde white a major <UNK> in <UNK> is the lame and <UNK> make up used to give the <UNK> their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable <UNK> the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally <UNK> and that's just not the right idea we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing <UNK> is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the <UNK> intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn't do them justice a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless
<START> like most comments i saw this film under the name of the <UNK> which is the <UNK> title apparently <UNK> which is the original is better but i doubt it br br most scenes of the <UNK> still include most <UNK> scenes and these are still bad in many ways i think the added nudity of the <UNK> at least added some entertainment value but don't be fooled there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> involved br br this movie is so <UNK> awful it's difficult to know what to <UNK> first the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker at least troma is tongue in cheek though this is straight faced boredom <UNK> the acting is <UNK> with pamela franklin <UNK> the possessed kid in the <UNK> would you believe the worst with her high pitched <UNK> voice welles seems merely waiting for his pay <UNK> the other female lead has a creepy face so i don't know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film and the doctor is pretty bad too he also looks <UNK> like gene wilder br br it is <UNK> filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy this is because the <UNK> is a copy and <UNK> job and not a subtle one at that only the lighting is ok the sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never <UNK> up the <UNK> mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs br br really this film the <UNK> at least is only for the <UNK> it can't have many sane fans as it's pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind numbingly dull br br the best bit was when the credits rolled enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague
<START> the strange people living in a town go about their lives there's the <UNK> a guy who <UNK> everything a <UNK> diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to <UNK> girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color the <UNK> takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel like a troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for <UNK> sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun though i didn't see the <UNK> coming worth a shot if you've nothing else to watch and you're waiting for the next set of golden girls to come from netflix
<START> i can't understand what it is that fans of the genre didn't like about this film it was truly a lot of fun the special effects were wonderful i generally agree with reviews and with imdb voters but not this time i waited until it came to home video which i felt was another reason that i wouldn't enjoy the film i believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case to me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time blair witch and the mummy both films that i thought were terrible blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time the mummy made <UNK> of money and it was pure dreck people liked it for it's special effects films like the mummy and the haunting are not rich in character development they are more like <UNK> rides well with that <UNK> the mummy was a b ticket to the <UNK> e ticket
<START> this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john <UNK> career he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his <UNK> even though it was made in 1980 it is still <UNK> today the great country music soundtrack is terrific 10 10
<START> corbin <UNK> sent letters to four criminal associates he's worked with in the past and it's a real <UNK> mix with fred <UNK> lou diamond phillips william russ and <UNK> <UNK> they're to meet him in this obscure montana town and he doesn't explain why because he's then picked up by out of state police from new jersey on a warrant br br of the criminal group that's been gathered together they all know bernsen but don't know each other a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out as the oldest <UNK> though denying it kind of takes charge with the others <UNK> but going along especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind br br as for bernsen he's got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of <UNK> in ed o'neill and daniel <UNK> he gets the drop on o'neill and escapes br br after that it's the four criminals trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the police in the <UNK> plotted screenplay it's fascinating how both story lines keep <UNK> with each other <UNK> <UNK> as the local sheriff watches in <UNK> at what unfolds in his town br br <UNK> crime is a <UNK> funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon i can't say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together br br ironically none of these people are comedians per se but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out br br <UNK> crime is one very funny caper movie the kind of film that well known <UNK> mr murphy would have written
<START> no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in trouble br br it was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isn't anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a point br br boring sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed <UNK> jr and <UNK> arquette aren't enough to save this film
<START> <UNK> debbie <UNK> is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she <UNK> for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome <UNK> when her date and his friends <UNK> say they belong to a murder club ' <UNK> takes it seriously and moves straight up to level <UNK> by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage for <UNK> her car but is <UNK> also the one <UNK> a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it br br the plot of this film originally titled make 'em bleed is very poorly conceived full of holes and <UNK> completely out of control before a ludicrous out of left field twist ending some of the dialogue is downright laughable i didn't have a problem with <UNK> performance but the supporting cast was atrocious however i managed to sit through this full moon release thoroughly entertained there's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from <UNK> stevens and lloyd kaufman as <UNK> parents and julie strain an early victim br br score 4 out of 10
<START> i enjoyed this movie quite a lot i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only <UNK> it she portrays a housewife in an african american family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's danny glover success as an attorney she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly yet a little awkward toward her the various events that <UNK> during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama i give it a strong 8 10 i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon
<START> it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all star flick i laughed through the entire picture as did my entire family the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy the players were hysterical i'll bet they had a good old time while making it of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great and how about those <UNK> sisters each of the two <UNK> and the divine music throughout rob <UNK> made a great laughing <UNK> driver and gabriel <UNK> a laughable neurotic not to mention gregory hines burt reynolds the sleepy joe character and the whole <UNK> and grave <UNK> references paul <UNK> was his usual entertaining self with the added attraction of running scared after <UNK> decided to make a <UNK> of his my way welcome home to <UNK> performance br br i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends dreyfuss <UNK> him well i am also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie it's a joke not a terrifying <UNK> film the cars and clothing were impressive as was the <UNK> <UNK> place br br truly i think of mad dog time as a musical comedy less <UNK> than many cartoons tv crime dramas and talk shows i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment
<START> i mark where there are spoilers overall comments if you can take a serious movie go see this have an open mind and you will enjoy it don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on the movie fits together nicely in the second half i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens br br i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago when will was going around promoting the movie he was great spent a lot of time with the fans thank you for the picture will about <UNK> performance a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie show you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance this is not the case with will smith in this movie i didn't picture the fresh prince lol when i was watching this movie he was completely and utterly convincing in this very very serious role he has grown immensely as an actor i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performance br br about his character ben is very conflicted and tormented he's sad guilt ridden very determined but very scared very true to himself his character has a lot of depth and somehow will managed to bring that to life br br about emily rosario rosario did a nice job portraying emily a woman very much behind on her <UNK> maybe she's not the shining star will is in this movie but she was very convincing i think her character just did not have as much to work with as <UNK> did br br about the plot no spoilers i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so but when things eventually fit together wow surprisingly well written and well thought out it's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you br br it actually takes a lot out of you to watch in the theater i was in most people were crying towards the end even grown men when you realize what ben is doing and why it's a very powerful moment br br minor spoilers which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed though i will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot away br br the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room at first it makes no sense whatsoever there was a lot of <UNK> in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish br br i hated ben at the beginning of the movie by the end of it i loved him and hated him that's how convincing will was i thought ben was being a huge jerk to <UNK> a blind man just trying to make his way in the world why he was treating <UNK> like that also became <UNK> clear later in the movie wait it out though everything in this movie wait it out br br ben is a <UNK> good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for it's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt or if he genuinely wanted to help people i think it's a little bit of both i think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past i love his character you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing you hate him because of what he is doing to himself as a very good person both physically and emotionally nice job will
<START> a great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script basic plot summary man with <UNK> fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of <UNK> coma and proceeds in <UNK> them to various degrees of success only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as i did and chopped the heck out of the movie nothing flows you get lost on which <UNK> he is with at the time didn't he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and <UNK> filming when he <UNK> not that i can blame him i passed out 2 3 times and had to <UNK> and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist warning when you see the ending do not try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an <UNK> not worth the time effort or god <UNK> money only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 the slim chance that the <UNK> occurred between film release and the horrible version that i watched
<START> i have recently seen this movie due to <UNK> recent success with <UNK> mountain i figured i would see the movies that i missed i had no expectations going into the film so was <UNK> that i had missed this movie at all it's a gripping father and son tale and it is also an underdog story i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale this movie appeals to all ages the only reason i give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle but it comes back strong in the end the acting was great the story was magnificent and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film go see this movie rent it buy it watch it love it i know i did
<START> <UNK> i really wasn't that impressed by this film though i must admit that it is technically well made it does get a 7 for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor in fact i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s it won the oscar for best picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing that's because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as meet me in st louis this movie is almost all singing and dancing in fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren't into this the film will quickly bore you give me more story as a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady <UNK> of <UNK> it just doesn't satisfy in the long run br br to think this is the film that beat out a <UNK> named desire and a place in the sun for best picture and to make matters worse the african queen and ace in the hole weren't even nominated in this category even more amazing to me is that ace in the hole lost for best writing screenplay to this film even though an american in paris had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song
<START> you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie well this was beyond that i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like 3 00 and i'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at it is really nothing short of pathetic about 30 minutes into the movie my friends started asking me to turn it off around 45 minutes they <UNK> me after an hour we <UNK> to fast forward to the end so we could see how the conflict was resolved and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh seriously don't watch this movie it is beyond painful
<START> this game show lasted just one season but was intriguing to audiences because it required visual <UNK> and a steady hand one false move would <UNK> the contestant from winning the prize even though it was clear the contestant knew the correct answer it was always exciting as the contestant began drawing wondering if they would complete the drawing or be <UNK> out allowing the other contestant to easily win the contest it was a light hearted show but it was clear that the contestants were often times embarrassed from a silly mistake made unintentionally rarely seen the game show did not survive past one single season only a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it proved to be quite <UNK> even though game shows were making a big return to the tv screen after the <UNK> of the 1950's game shows but it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has as yet never been seen again
<START> i can count on one hand the number of good movies starring joe don baker this is not one of them br br interminable chase scenes dim witted dialogue and terrible <UNK> in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send up on mst3k br br and that is the only way i was able to watch this
<START> the dvd was a joke the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and <UNK> voice not even his pathetic when the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be br br while segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it br br if segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show because he has no talent what so ever in this br br this film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it i turned it off in about 20 minutes br br i will be asking for my money back at block buster mark from <UNK> canada
<START> having listened to and enjoyed harvey <UNK> omen ii commentary i was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish it's like a really bad tv movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the <UNK> and are too ill to reach the remote i think at the bit where michael <UNK> is confronted by what i can only describe as a high school cast of les <UNK> my mouth hung open in disbelief and then my mouth was going up and down because i was laughing so much dire i don't know why i have to write a minimum of ten lines i have made my point <UNK> there's nothing clever about all this modern <UNK>
<START> i purchased this movie on <UNK> ray because it promised great visuals and music i was also a great fan of a similar movie <UNK> the movie is very much <UNK> after <UNK> wide angles very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot even some of the scenes were identical the street with traffic whereas <UNK> told a great story <UNK> nature man made <UNK> <UNK> and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no <UNK> story mediocre musical score and then <UNK> it's finished i thought there must be some sort of mistake history of the world half the movie is egypt and landscape looks like arizona but i didn't bother to check seriously folks this is horrible rent it if you must but do not buy it the filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out
<START> can a <UNK> ever ever ever do anything right this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a <UNK> format since a <UNK> doesn't even believe in pan and <UNK> we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side of course not that you are missing much this movie is incredibly bad it's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their <UNK> during 80 of the movie for no reason
<START> i like my ronald colman dashing and <UNK> the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and <UNK> i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost <UNK> and random <UNK> a brooding colman isn't a favorite of mine br br but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for <UNK> it became his best known part br br colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously he's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he's quite the <UNK> fellow for a change of pace now that that play has <UNK> its broadway run colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york about as opposite a part as you can get br br his leading lady in both is his former wife <UNK> <UNK> who loves him <UNK> but can't take his change of <UNK> when he's at work colman loves her <UNK> as well and wants her back but he's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous <UNK> othello and <UNK> with her role as <UNK> br br unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor <UNK> in the play killed in the same manner and now it's a matter for homicide cop joe <UNK> br br <UNK> performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an <UNK> <UNK> with actors i'd <UNK> to think so were there any <UNK> <UNK> in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they <UNK> othello br br i could never quite buy the story for that reason but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part i'm sure there was a <UNK> of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other <UNK> was his good friend william powell for life with father others in the running that year were gregory peck for <UNK> <UNK> john garfield for body and soul and michael redgrave for mourning becomes <UNK> br br colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including <UNK> o'brien who finds himself in the <UNK> part of <UNK> in <UNK> jealous fantasy still you will find no <UNK> equivalent in a double life no one <UNK> the jealousy it's all in his own mind br br and that from one of the most <UNK> and <UNK> minds of the last century
<START> i doubt this will ever even be a cult film i loved <UNK> parsons to be sure and i did not expect much out of this film and got even less what could have been clever and moving was campy it was devoid of the music that made <UNK> and had more filler than cheap dog food there was no background on <UNK> or the colorful people of that era the characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of <UNK> and all the versions of his <UNK> adventures i have heard rock and roll is full of tales good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt they can be great stories even though exaggerated however this movie took a good story and turned into tripe stealing any dead body and the ensuing <UNK> should never be a dull tale but they made it dull somehow i am tempted to steal every copy of grand <UNK> parsons head out to the desert and burn them all
<START> this movie has one redeeming feature at one point after a character is attacked by an <UNK> wielding fairy his brother asks him why is your dick over there chuck after suffering through almost an hour of bad film this almost made my drink come out my nose br br some of the acting isn't too bad but the kids all stink and p j soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film the story is weak and nobody does what you think or what common sense <UNK> they should br br of course there are a lot of story points that don't add up for example in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist a difficult feat since they apparently can't interact with physical matter however minutes later they all pick up <UNK> off the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes they can't go figure br br lots of blood and guts though a few nice boobs but this doesn't make up for the <UNK> br br if you want a movie about the tooth fairy go rent darkness falls i think it's great though a lot of other reviewers don't share my opinion at least it sets a mood
<START> ok first of all steve irwin rest in peace you were loved by many fans now this movie wasn't a movie at all it was the crocodile hunter tv program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between steve capturing or teaching us about animals he was entertaining as an animal <UNK> <UNK> millions will miss him but the whole movie idea was a big mistake the plot was so broken it was almost non existent casting was horrible the acting wasn't even worth <UNK> school level actors the direction must be <UNK> as well if you can't get a half way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place i could have written a better script i wish i had never been to see this movie of course i watched it for 3 1 50 for me 1 50 for my son while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of scooby doo live action my son who is not so <UNK> liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again if you want fond memories of steve irwin buy his series on dvd avoid this movie like the plague if i were steve i know i wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie respect him avoid this movie
<START> this is just a great fun lovely film it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors though this film may only be in black and white it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless this movie features great acting beautiful song and dance numbers and great design work and film shots follow the fleet is also comical there are funny moments moments that will make you laugh but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade how it can affect those today if you want to see something great check this out
<START> cradle of fear br br this isn't a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances <UNK> our attention this is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack <UNK> <UNK> that sense of <UNK> what it is though is a slice of lo fi <UNK> horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director alex <UNK> as a <UNK> to sleazy '70s and '80s horror br br this is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of <UNK> blood <UNK> of <UNK> body parts and <UNK> tied by an <UNK> thread of revenge br br the <UNK> of such horrific violence is dani filth lead singer of the metal band cradle of filth <UNK> a role he was destined to play br br as other's have said there is nothing new about wanting to <UNK> <UNK> revenge in this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer <UNK> the father of our <UNK> <UNK> angel <UNK> his son to exact <UNK> on those who are some how connected to <UNK> him to <UNK> within an insane asylum br br what this provides for the <UNK> who should be <UNK> on also <UNK> and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free he seems to take delight in the idea of <UNK> blood into the <UNK> of those on screen and into every <UNK> and <UNK> that can be reached we are also treated to close ups of <UNK> being crushed demonic rape and other <UNK> imagery to engage those who <UNK> getting up close and personal to their horror and for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking did i just see what i thought i did because of course pretty woman this <UNK> it reminds me of some of the gore <UNK> created out of italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed br br story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the sick room where the user is in control of how a life can be <UNK> out further <UNK> should also go out to a <UNK> soundtrack that allows filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in film making as a <UNK> form of supporting visuals using the city of london as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand ins also adds support to the <UNK> feel of the film ok classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse <UNK> way it is
<START> this is a wonderful film makes the 1950's look beautifully stylish kim novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern day witch with one foot in manhattan and another in <UNK> all the supporting performances are terrific from jack lemmon as her bother <UNK> to ernie <UNK> as the author of magic in mexico who is working on magic in <UNK> to elsa <UNK> as the slightly <UNK> as well as <UNK> aunt <UNK> and then there is the cat i have no idea how many witches besides me have named a cat <UNK> but suggest a <UNK> <UNK> stewart looks out of place but only just as much as his character is out of p ace in this weird sub world of magic and witchcraft perfect and it has the perfect romantic happy ending which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings gillian and <UNK> certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as rose and charlie <UNK> in the african queen another great film
<START> me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a premiere surprise that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in <UNK> we sat through the 1st hour or so and then we left the point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era and club <UNK> but it did so at the <UNK> of character development of which there was none and plot of which there was little br br seldom have i been so indifferent to the characters in a movie br br the music was good though so if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that <UNK> mood i guess it is ok but don't expect to get a plot of believable characters br br
<START> okay okay maybe not the greatest i mean the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up but the shining is way up there it is however by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie it's better than the stand better than pet sematary if not quite as scary better than <UNK> better than the green mile better the <UNK> <UNK> better than stand by me just barely though and yes it's better than the <UNK> redemption shut up it's better i don't care what the imdb top 250 says br br i read that a couple of decades ago stanley kubrick was <UNK> through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie and from the other room his wife would hear a <UNK> noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration finally she didn't hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something i tell this with all due respect of course she found him <UNK> on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining and thank god too because he went on to <UNK> that book into one of the best horror films ever br br stephen king can be <UNK> for the complexity of the story about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to <UNK> it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing jack nicholson can be <UNK> for his dead on performance as jack <UNK> how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack as well as his flawless delivery of several now famous lines <UNK> johnny ' shelley duvall can be <UNK> for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack's desires to kill her stanley kubrick can be <UNK> for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch and whoever the casting director was can be <UNK> for <UNK> up the <UNK> twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls br br one of the most significant aspects of this movie necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect is the isolation and it's presents <UNK> the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the <UNK> mountain road to the hotel this time the scene is <UNK> with shots of jack wendy and danny talking in the car in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the <UNK> of tv as wendy voices her concern about talking about <UNK> in front of danny who says that it's okay because he's already seen it on tv see it's okay he saw it on the television ' br br the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place and it's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge <UNK> rooms and the long <UNK> these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the <UNK> of the hotel but it is the <UNK> that really created most of the <UNK> of this movie and kubrick's traditional tracking shots give the <UNK> a creepy three dimensional feel early in the film there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the <UNK> on his big wheel is that what those are called and his relative speed as well as the <UNK> made by the <UNK> as he goes back and forth from the <UNK> floors to the throw <UNK> gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner and being a stephen king story you expect something to jump out at you i think that the best scene in the <UNK> as well as one of the scariest in the film is when danny is playing on the floor and a ball rolls slowly up to him he looks up and sees the long empty <UNK> and because the ball is something of a child's toy you expect that it must have been those <UNK> creepy twins that rolled it to him anyway you get the point the shining is a damn scary movie br br besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that doesn't suck the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed had jack always been there like mr grady told him in the men's room was he really at that ball in <UNK> or is that just someone who looks exactly like him if he has always been the caretaker as mr grady also said does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters and not mr grady after all it's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied that's just mediocre filmmaking for example the <UNK> horror which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter did this but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think as mostly all of kubrick's movies are one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for and we should thank him for is for not throwing this book against the wall that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy
<START> this <UNK> comedy seems very forced indeed the actors try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script and as a result it doesn't really go anywhere the idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a <UNK> divorce just isn't all that funny and then when cooper <UNK> off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for <UNK> just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy it's really a shame too as the actors were more capable than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess considering that cooper made so many good comedies i recommend you see them instead
<START> you will recognize the plot immediately daughters of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together again yes that was the theme of the parent trap in the 60s 80s and 90s but here's the spooky thing even though deanna durbin was younger than the 21 year old <UNK> mills while playing the <UNK> daughter s roles durbin looks much older as in adult and so do all of her so called siblings br br and this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film the girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and <UNK> throughout the film so you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women when ray <UNK> and others start hitting on them you get the feeling as if they're <UNK> and you might be one too for <UNK> those <UNK> and tops the director was pointing out teens or <UNK> little girls or little <UNK> you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as br br the parents too seem very old and the whole film seems very dated br br it is a rusty version of the parent trap and you should avoid it or at least ensure your <UNK> shots are up to date if you don't believe me

<START> i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the new year's weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b grade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semi interesting so i rented it what a mistake don't be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent i'm thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired <UNK> serial killer called the head hunter who is <UNK> victims left and right in some <UNK> city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of <UNK> murder br br story sound somewhat good well it is and this movie could've been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some <UNK> actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them <UNK> off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts <UNK> for absolutely no reason while trying to <UNK> <UNK> sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs quality camera and i'm assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was <UNK> and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone's bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didn't hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just bad br br overall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b movie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it could've been alright but this movie fell flat on it's face if you're expecting something semi decent you'll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate d grade horror flicks otherwise you'll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 1 10
<START> if you watched this movie you know why i said jesus jesus jesus <UNK> every time they said jesus jesus jesus i laughed thinking jesus jesus jesus why did i rent this movie i cannot believe how oscar winners like freeman and spacey appeared here in the background while timberlake and ll cool j grabbed the screen wtf is timberlake <UNK> acting i think someone like joshua jackson could have done a much better job this job was perfect for joshua jackson and believe me i am not a big fun of him but i really prefer an actor not this <UNK> called timberlake and his girlfriend was shallow hollow and annoying as hell i was happy when they both were popped in the street br br the story was ok and i think dylan <UNK> <UNK> did his bad guy role very well the movie was entertaining but i think timberlake ruined it all it would have been much enjoyable without him br br by the way the music was ok but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a mtv video clip with flashes low motion and things like that something misplaced for this cops movie i thought maybe they wanted to make a mtv video clip for timberlake
<START> i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers this is just a higher <UNK> television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world from the notes i can see that it's been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen i can agree with their decision avoid this show at all costs it's terrible and ridiculous
<START> its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even <UNK> how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to <UNK> in three films into one and fails it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one except with the odd exception where the impressive <UNK> music brings back memories of the old films br br the only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v

<START> i know it is <UNK> now to hate this movie i have seen hundreds of <UNK> films including he original 1963 haunting as well as most of the hammer films this film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it yet many viewers can accept out of control films like scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great i have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time the director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the <UNK> sense the haunting lets go and is certainly not boring perhaps this film might appeal more to john carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure the old haunting was also a fine film from 1963 it was even more scary see both and also the <UNK> and the legend of hell house with pamela franklin
<START> sure <UNK> years have passed since <UNK> last production was filmed but fellow imdb members come on this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30's it is a 10 br br this was the first movie i saw at new <UNK> museum of modern art around 1970 i was a teenager expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty masterfully photographed often thrilling and always engaging to me it was mgm movie making at its best what did audiences feel when they <UNK> a <UNK> attack the person by person destruction of a mansion the horrific poverty and then the <UNK> of wealth br br last week those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the senior oscar winner in <UNK> <UNK> rainer how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful haunting performances in history <UNK> to return for a celebration br br ok so she should not have won the year before great <UNK> but don't blame <UNK> <UNK> were only a decade old when this was released and her dialogue limited but as <UNK> her use of visual and vocal is memorable br br large scale and touching what more could a movie lover want
<START> man this movie sucked big time i didn't even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie and i don't mean all the naked <UNK> it's something about the light or something this could <UNK> become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it's an original movie white a nice plot twist my final words are don't see it it's not worth the time if you wanna see it because the <UNK> there's lots of better ones to see
<START> though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience there were some who in the wake of the emotion on the <UNK> of the <UNK> took this to be anti american i don't think thats the case even though some parts might be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion sympathy and feelings about what happened these are stories of people who's worlds have been <UNK> up by what happened on a <UNK> in september br br as i said this film will move you probably to tears its not always easy to watch for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low if you can be strong you really should see this film it will comfort you and <UNK> you and affect you
<START> and i'm serious truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching what's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and <UNK> but it is a rare <UNK> indeed but i think that the fact that louis <UNK> was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is br br 1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesn't matter if it's real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who <UNK> life into the book and turns it into <UNK> genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis <UNK> the guy who had me reading a book <UNK> from start to finish so that i couldn't put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script the one liners in this are smart funny and <UNK> but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and <UNK> at your <UNK> to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack there's not a song in this film that i haven't fallen for and that's something considering i'm supposed to be a punk rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if you're going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which <UNK> around the story and contains the chorus from the book br br i do not work for the people who made holes by the way i'm just a fan <UNK> my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you haven't seen it do it now this very instant go
<START> i definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film this book won national book <UNK> award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended it's not too difficult to read for those out there that don't read often so don't be afraid the book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book having grown up in melbourne i could really relate to this book and movie very few australian female writers were around the in the 70's therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in australia during this era or class it's a precious piece of melbourne history it's a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80's soft porn movie it's far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the dvd jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed just remember this movie was made in 1982 so don't expect the hollywood over <UNK> that they seem to <UNK> these days this is what i like about it it's also great seeing <UNK> <UNK> in this role she is just fantastic as nora and it's great watching her really acting for if you're close to my age you will best remember her for her <UNK> on <UNK> and better homes and gardens who knew she <UNK> this talent this movie will give you an entirely new impression of her a classic australian story
<START> although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front this silly and superficial version of war falls far <UNK> of its much better contemporary this depicts the <UNK> war ever fought with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times br br when we finally see some battle it is lame an enemy plane flies over shoot it down in one shot sniper in the tree kill him before he gets a shot off enemy soldiers in the woods not to worry they gladly surrender ho hum br br tepid turgid predictable br br
<START> this made for tv film is a brilliant one this is probably the best and favourite role by <UNK> winning john <UNK> <UNK> q c and inspector morse tom <UNK> <UNK> widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died and now he has been landed with an <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> nick robinson as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship until <UNK> mum <UNK> <UNK> wants him back after tom gets worried about william not <UNK> him he goes to london to find him in the end <UNK> gets his home with a loving family or dad set during the second world war this is an excellent film it was nominated the <UNK> <UNK> grade award and it won the national television award for most popular drama john <UNK> was number 3 on tv's 50 greatest stars very good
<START> an apparent vanity project for <UNK> <UNK> who as a <UNK> charles bronson going around <UNK> up the <UNK> that <UNK> her parents or grandparents or something and <UNK> young <UNK> with her karate skills in a pivotal scene she <UNK> to stop a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail so after a couple cool shower scenes and some <UNK> prison dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah i guess there were a lot of movies like this the script is dumber than usual if you can believe that <UNK> comes off as exactly the kind of <UNK> type that would co produce her own death wish starring role and i find that type <UNK> endearing but the movie is an <UNK> <UNK> competent actors would be wasted on the <UNK> roles here and would <UNK> <UNK> the fantastic <UNK> incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the <UNK> uncle
<START> it's not a big film the acting is not amazing some sub <UNK> are even played badly the film is not beautiful in any sense nothing really inventive or new if you like big films this one is not for you yet it has a big really big plus on the story <UNK> story works because we know this story from our own lives the girl we didn't ask to a date the test we've failed the friend we let down are all in our history this movie works because it touch it it's a great story because it's a small one it's the life we all have with regrets we all have and yet the message hits every life we could have lived would have had their downside the first time i watched it i was 15 it was shown in a party at my school 16 years later i keep <UNK> on it every once in a while and every time i see it it puts a smile on my face watch it it will do you good you'll be happier with what you have
<START> the acting in this movie was superb as an amateur <UNK> i found very few mistakes as a human being it touched my heart and soul to watch the actors you would think that they are the actual characters laura dern a favorite actress of mine left nothing out of her performance the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years especially young homer <UNK> father inspired that eternal love hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real if you don't get a <UNK> in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms then get your pulse checked you may be dead
<START> gorgeous barbara bach plays jennifer fast a television reporter who travels with her crew karen <UNK> and lois young to <UNK> california to cover a danish festival the problem is that their <UNK> have fallen through and all <UNK> in town are full so they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the <UNK> of the seemingly friendly ernest <UNK> a phenomenal sydney <UNK> wouldn't you know it ernest and meek partner virginia <UNK> <UNK> are hiding a big secret in their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> clad junior stephen <UNK> in a remarkable performance who ultimately <UNK> the girls br br a deliciously unhinged <UNK> plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie it builds slowly but surely to an intense confrontation climax delivering the horror in small doses until the final half hour the hotel and the foreboding <UNK> large echoes of psycho here are great settings most of all the perverse plot involves incest and <UNK> allowing the movie to take on a truly dark quality and yet it also becomes poignant as we realize junior is no one <UNK> evil <UNK> but as much a victim as the girls the final shot is especially sad br br the unseen is a solid little horror flick worthy of discovery br br 8 10
<START> all you need to know about this film happens in the first five minutes it looks cool it has a solid original soundtrack <UNK> of the late 60s period and all but a couple of its characters are unlikeable once you get that message you may as well switch to another film br br <UNK> protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend one of the few people in his life who cares about him then by the time he takes her advice to join her in the real world instead of living a fantasy film of which he's the imagined director he does so by pushing her aside and pairing up with an actress he's <UNK> beyond reason a couple laughs and some thoughtful art direction are the only things worth watching here br br the film is also interesting as <UNK> of jason <UNK> fall from <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> annoying <UNK> was something to be overcome but here it's his character's only quality <UNK> family connection clearly landed him in this role here's hoping his choices improve
<START> considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny <UNK> tarzan films i have no argument with that although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining one thing it's the longest of the series that i've seen at <UNK> minutes i've only seen six of them but this was longer than i'm used to and with the drawn out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long br br nonetheless it is a good mixture of action suspense and romance the only things missing are color and <UNK> sound the primitive special effects don't bother me as that was all that they had back in the 1930s br br among some this film is most noted for one thing skin jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the <UNK> code was <UNK> by the time the next tarzan film was made her outfit showed what a great figure maureen <UNK> possessed the nude underwater scene however was not her by a <UNK> the woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all whoever it was br br there is plenty of action in here up to the finale it was not overdone either the ending went on for 15 minutes though and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch br br still this movie offers about everything except boy their adopted son you'd want to see in a tarzan film even <UNK> doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times with her pair of <UNK> that was no problem
<START> how can anyone not love this movie i think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if you've never seen them watch this instead michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes one guy <UNK> the english language <UNK> he talks and <UNK> <UNK> plays a clueless d a but my favorite role has got to be joe <UNK> he has all the best lines danny <UNK> alan hale ray <UNK> are in this star <UNK> movie that <UNK> gangsters a lot funnier than mafia did for the criminal underground
<START> ultra grim crime drama from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the director of home sweet home <UNK> it reminded me of billy <UNK> run and kill although it's not as polished as that nevertheless it's an engaging flawed bit of mayhem about a <UNK> loner <UNK> edison <UNK> who arrives in hong kong to kill a lawyer while fleeing the scene he kills the partner of cop sam <UNK> who to add insult to injury is in the midst of dealing with his dying father so sam begins an insane obsessive <UNK> for <UNK> that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence there must be something in the air lately because i've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as i have lately this is grim nasty stuff which is why i'm so partial to it and i applaud its downbeat vibe it's visually <UNK> and the sound design is very unique dramatically everything <UNK> <UNK> until every character finds him or herself in a world of screaming pain a subplot involving <UNK> <UNK> to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and <UNK> a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery
<START> i first saw this movie when it originally came out i was about 9 <UNK> old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time br br basic plot an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of <UNK> a great <UNK> star in <UNK> <UNK> to find out what happened to a colony of <UNK> which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since br br theme an inferior civilization namely <UNK> comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization the <UNK> 200 000 years removed the seed of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another <UNK> at first the theme of this movie is very much good vs evil br br i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature force i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie br br what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie forbidden knowledge and how relevant this will be when we do if ever come into contact with an advanced alien civilization far more developed than we ourselves are <UNK> advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand we must do the work for ourselves to <UNK> the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology this is in my opinion the great moral of the movie br br i learned in graduate school that knowledge is power is at best in fact not correct knowledge is potential power depending upon how it is applied if it is applied at all it's not what you know but how you use what you know br br the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in <UNK> own future that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough we must must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the <UNK> in the movie just <UNK> out br br many thanks to those who <UNK> to earlier versions of this article with comments and <UNK> they are all very much appreciated i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40 years br br rating 10 out 10 stars
<START> this is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement from the very start i was utterly hooked into the true story when lt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rea <UNK> while performing the <UNK> on the remains of the children's bodies this then is the compelling story of <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully played by jeffrey <UNK> the green mile in fact he plays it so well and so <UNK> that the viewer almost starts to pity him until we remember what he is the psychiatrist dr <UNK> <UNK> wonderfully played by max von <UNK> was utterly believable in every detail and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the soviet union is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local communist <UNK> <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> for me though the outstanding performance was from donald sutherland proving once again what a superb character actor he really is i was almost in tears when he told <UNK> how the fbi had so closely followed and admired his work this film puts silence of the <UNK> into the <UNK> from the atmospheric and bleak soviet landscape to the <UNK> performances by everyone involved br br i rate this film 10 10
<START> one note comedy that probably sets modern day <UNK> teeth on edge department store clerk <UNK> drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage <UNK> her hopes on women's magazines until she spies super bait in the form of <UNK> bachelor cary grant the rest of the film <UNK> from one <UNK> to the next as the relentless drake <UNK> her <UNK> i guess the word <UNK> just about <UNK> up <UNK> approach to the role she does have a charming smile but after 20 minutes of <UNK> her <UNK> i began to <UNK> <UNK> role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair there is one scene however that almost <UNK> this <UNK> exercise drake <UNK> the hapless grant following his lecture to a <UNK> of respectable ladies here her <UNK> manner has an <UNK> <UNK> that is really quite remarkable and had the production not <UNK> our <UNK> in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes the film might have <UNK> to more than a girls' camp day dream circa 1948
<START> this is not michael <UNK> fault he was hardly in it this movie was just awful if you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie words cannot describe how idiotic it is sorry michael the cinematography was dark all the other actors are <UNK> when watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or <UNK> scenes this movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground s m killer the acting was bad except michael <UNK> parts he looked like he wanted to laugh i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie it is something i would not be proud of it is not even a b movie for cable it is more like a f and it should never be shown ever
<START> playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a <UNK> <UNK> for an actor paying for the pleasure of a <UNK> character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors who've <UNK> the castle before fortunately for the <UNK> this version  with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it it's the right length to do the story full justice and makes considerable use of <UNK> cracking dialogue none of that modern <UNK> away cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes br br the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters and the lives circumstances create for them to lead jane  poor plain and little  grows up on the <UNK> charity of a cold aunt her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school she arrives as a <UNK> in the household of mr rochester utterly <UNK> and alone she <UNK> herself <UNK> out of duty and hard experience but her passionate nature soon finds its touch paper in her stern <UNK> intelligent enigmatic master to whom she is drawn as he is to her by forces beyond their control rochester is the <UNK> tiger busy <UNK> hell with energy potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but <UNK> through a <UNK> or two his character is extraordinary he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid <UNK> but then jane is no ordinary employee as he sees but a dark secret and severe trials lie before them both br br it's a pleasure to hear <UNK> remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a <UNK> scale if you've only ever seen him as a not so memorable bond you've missed the thing he's best at those who've commented that his rochester is too handsome miss the point of these <UNK> his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer's attention timothy dalton is just right not always or consistently handsome but often <UNK> strikingly so just as it should be and zelah <UNK> jane is no <UNK> she conveys the emotions of a woman who <UNK> <UNK> her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully allowing her rare <UNK> to show to more dramatic effect br br not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent <UNK> of jean <UNK> <UNK> and most unsettling <UNK> to <UNK> wide <UNK> sea imagining the back story of the first mrs rochester do check it out  you'll never see the <UNK> of jane eyre in quite the same way again
<START> i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some 13 months old i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry i watched it again on tv a few years ago big mistake the acting is wooden the plot non existent and the movie lacks merit unless 23 year old t a is what gets you going 0
<START> jungle fever is too highly stylized stereotyped and comes across as essentially <UNK> wesley snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and <UNK> <UNK> even though there's plenty of talent in this movie it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than <UNK> cameos also instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is spike lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner i made it through most of the film but i couldn't quite finish it and that for me rarely happens
<START> light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if you've read the novel then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and <UNK> explored human relationships br br true enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably <UNK> acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend br br <UNK> seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesn't seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was <UNK> pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we don't have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship <UNK> we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to <UNK> there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she <UNK> <UNK> character <UNK> br br <UNK> is the only person in this movie aside from the <UNK> great acting there who manages to prove some acting talent he has his character's attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to <UNK> the scene at his parents' meal he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all br br i love the story <UNK> <UNK> is ok there the <UNK> actually acts and <UNK> delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesn't save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme br br oddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no background no feeling well <UNK> spoken <UNK> are a nice try in this direction lesbian relationship of maria and <UNK> i'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket i'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room
<START> anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless <UNK> who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies this film is riveting and doesn't have a boring moment why because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis i repeat intelligent dialogue that is what <UNK> nearly all of <UNK> films and that is why a lot of people don't like them they prefer action fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and <UNK> will continue to seek out films like this br br rohmer has always been accused of being talky well he is but to me that's a compliment not a criticism shakespeare was talky too is there a <UNK> play than hamlet whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about <UNK> and noble birth vs <UNK> loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person <UNK> that life is not so nice or even despicable anyone ever hear of <UNK> or crime and punishment these are what this film is all about br br the two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles lucy russell who is english and speaks french as her second language is especially brilliant do yourself a favor and see this riveting film it may be the last film by this screen master
<START> jet li is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world he has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame while he is big in asia he is almost unknown here in the us br br black mask is supposed to be a <UNK> movie for him but it fails horribly first of all it is dubbed while it may have camp value the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer secondly the director in this movie daniel lee does a horrible job he cuts scenes so fast at times you don't know what's going on other times the camera shakes and <UNK> fans see jet <UNK> movies for the fantastic martial arts however the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time other times a scene is left hanging ie li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a <UNK> while the <UNK> arm their guns two seconds later both li and the love interest are already under the car other scenes are so improbable that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous killer cd <UNK> just give him throwing stars li needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic <UNK> a scene the added rap <UNK> music goes from being okay to <UNK> the plot has possibilities but are all <UNK> by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie <UNK> for and are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize simon because he has a half mask on wouldn't the hair lower jaw or voice give it away br br if you want to see a jet li movie try iron monkey or his classic shaolin temple this disjointed mess is a complete waste of time 2 10
<START> the fbi story 1959 was warner bros <UNK> minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don <UNK> came a somewhat <UNK> screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a <UNK> of flair by <UNK> <UNK> however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph <UNK> and a helpful score by the <UNK> musical magician max <UNK> br br the movie <UNK> the history of the <UNK> from its <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> to modern times and its all seen through the <UNK> of aging <UNK> agent chip <UNK> james stewart as he relates his <UNK> experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but it's all very long <UNK> and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young <UNK> runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> like the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the <UNK> role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond <UNK> to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pity br br the film does however manage to give a good look inside the <UNK> of the <UNK> with the help of stewart's narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the <UNK> which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a <UNK> inside <UNK> which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the <UNK> and <UNK> experts <UNK> going through their daily <UNK> br br another plus for the movie is max <UNK> remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the <UNK> <UNK> moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sequence and better still is the <UNK> latin american music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting <UNK> like <UNK> for the arrival of the federal troops on <UNK> the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included samuel <UNK> naval epic john paul jones the charming <UNK> com cash <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> western the hanging tree and <UNK> a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for <UNK> better known as theme from a summer place br br the fbi story just about passes <UNK> as a movie thanks to <UNK> rich colour cinematography <UNK> wonderful music and of course <UNK> stewart who makes anything watchable br br classic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with <UNK> people on board including his mother is being led away <UNK> he turns to the <UNK> officer and <UNK> in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow
<START> this film is totally garbage some <UNK> intellectual <UNK> himself by making all his best to claim <UNK> of aristocrat over working class nothing more than a piece of self <UNK> <UNK> disgusting br br if this kind of a movie is set in us it will sure make itself a big joke and simply because it comes out from 'the other <UNK> it makes itself a masterpiece a wonderful amusement for certain brain washed and or brain <UNK> westerns some george w maybe a typical cold war <UNK> some kind of joke anyway br br i would say if this like expressed in this film is all what soviet <UNK> had been thinking about all those years then maybe they deserve all the <UNK> they claim they had gone through but no 'cause like many others i've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding soviet <UNK> for example something also relevant with dog white <UNK> black ear both <UNK> <UNK> book and <UNK> <UNK> movie is a real masterpiece real life real tragedy real sad real pride and dignity one of the real best of the soviet era
<START> this movie is bad it's basically an overdone copy of michael jackson's thriller video only worse the special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick <UNK> camera shots and lots of <UNK> i think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie
<START> chilling <UNK> piece of cinematic fright this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller with the grand vision of a director who has the <UNK> capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot an ice cold soundtrack and an overall sense of <UNK> this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red poker through a human eye as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and <UNK> of its protagonist but appreciate the seed from which the <UNK> <UNK> one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind the setting is perfect in a desolate winter <UNK> the <UNK> of the moment is a character in itself as the <UNK> <UNK> in jack <UNK> mind <UNK> in this <UNK> time and <UNK> the devil's new <UNK> i always felt like the presence of evil was <UNK> in all of our minds with only the circumstances of the moment and the reasons given <UNK> needed to wake its violent ass and <UNK> over its unsuspecting victims this film is a perfect example of this very thought br br and it is within this film's subtle touches of the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty <UNK> of the hotel the <UNK> garden representing the <UNK> fine line between sane and insane kubrick's <UNK> <UNK> editing inconsistencies continuity errors and set <UNK> <UNK> that we discover a world guided by the righteous and <UNK> but <UNK> away by the powerful and unknown i have never read the book upon which the film is based but without that as a comparison point i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen i thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit but then again i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film so maybe i should keep my two <UNK> criticisms over a superb film to myself all in all this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision <UNK> you in with some terror and eccentric direction and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity br br rating 9 10
<START> this game was made by <UNK> being made by <UNK> i didn't expect much but i also didn't expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldn't even be worth renting
<START> poorly structured badly written loaded with cliches and flat dialogue not a single scene shines the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises plot twists or conflict you know from the first ten minutes where it's going br br for a movie set in ny it has almost no feeling for the city there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget this one seems like it was shot in toronto br br if you cast natasha <UNK> why dress her in <UNK> <UNK> why make <UNK> look boring and drab where's the attraction i felt like i was watching a sub par christian movie of the week it was so <UNK> and <UNK> br br steven <UNK> big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
<START> and it doesn't help <UNK> case that a few years later <UNK> came along and made a <UNK> great piece of work on the same subject with a little help from wagner br br maybe this movie didn't look so <UNK> when it came out without the <UNK> film to compare it to which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources i actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the <UNK> film all i know is the german version is pure magic while this one looks like some college production documented on film for <UNK> purposes br br the music la <UNK> isn't even credited here on imdb but someone based it on <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> centuries or something well it isn't a great help to the film it comes off as <UNK> and cheesy <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> cher br br rohmer is one of those french <UNK> who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive too and that doesn't help matters <UNK> <UNK> was adorable and can be seen on german television today selling some kind of special <UNK> he invented br br i <UNK> to think what watching the <UNK> on video is like i remember that the last time i saw the film in a theater the print was so bad that the experience was a <UNK> 5 hour travesty but even then it would have to <UNK> what this version has to offer i'm afraid br br points for <UNK> for <UNK> but this film simply needed beau coup more bucks it doesn't look like a medieval <UNK> it looks <UNK> bon <UNK> oh and yeah it just ends very <UNK> with <UNK> going to church and this cheesy passion play being <UNK> blah
<START> when i rented this i was hoping for what reign of fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and <UNK> <UNK> br br instead i got a standard monster <UNK> stupid people in remote building flick with bad script bad music bad effects bad plot bad acting bad bad bad br br only reason why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies in theory
<START> lisa <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> wife of a big businessman who <UNK> <UNK> life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business <UNK> initially she is suspected of being responsible as her husbands will had recently been changed and so she has an insurance investigator peter lynch george hilton and an <UNK> agent on her tail just to be sure <UNK> travels to <UNK> <UNK> to cash in her inheritance but insists on having it in cash a dangerous turn of events lynch who's identity is now known to <UNK> tries to protect her against a lover of her husband lara <UNK> who nevertheless along with her henchman <UNK> tries to kill them both for a share of the money that she <UNK> she is entitled to and this is where our masked killer starts his her brutal killings lynch as is <UNK> with our hero is at first suspected by the greek police and is warned not to leave <UNK> by police inspector <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a familiar face in giallo and <UNK> lynch is then aided by the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> anita <UNK> a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings to say any more could ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it so suffice to say there are enough red herrings and most of them plausible to keep mystery thriller fans happy in this story driven giallo the no shame dvd has a superb transfer with both english and italian soundtrack it also has a very catchy score just for good measure by bruno <UNK> that will stay in your head for a while all in all a first rate giallo
<START> when i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies i watched then with very low expectations now this movie isn't bad per se you get what you pay for it is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie definitely not a hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad i would probably never watch this movie again in a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work i didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my dvd player the story has been done many times in many movies this one is no different no better no worse br br just your average movie
<START> i don't know how to describe this movie it's definitely one of the <UNK> movies i've seen in a long time it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore splatter i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling br br the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone but if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting <UNK> to dust this is just the film you were looking for br br if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment give it a try br br my rating 4 10 maybe a little too weird for my taste
<START> i may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel the original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward put these two actors in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad
<START> i have two good things to say about this film the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction however that said i found this film extremely tiresome watching paint dry would have been more entertaining it seemed much longer than <UNK> minutes beginning with opening sequence where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone the movie is annoying the film is filled with clichés and <UNK> not to mention endless incidents of <UNK> <UNK> by falk also the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears there are some sequences that are touching but they're all played for laughs if <UNK> sentimental and cute appeal to you you'll love it but if you were hoping for something with more substance see a different movie
<START> the running man along with total recall is my favorite <UNK> movie no this isn't 2001 but it's not meant to be and the acting and script here isn't even up to par with other arnie movies like predator or the terminator but i submit that the idea behind this movie is one of the coolest ever to hit the big screen a state <UNK> game show in which criminals convicted of serious crimes compete against heroic <UNK> armed with all kinds of weapons the <UNK> are <UNK> with none in order to satisfy the <UNK> lust for sport and blood the ultimate prize for a winning runner freedom or so the rules claim br br for a movie with such over the top gory death scenes and cheesy one liners it really does have a lot to say someone else has pointed out all the commentary on culture government presented in this movie so i won't go into it here suffice it to say that if you can look beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie you will enjoy it very much especially if you're a big sf fan with a lot of imagination like i said it's not trying to be a serious art film but it is surprisingly layered for a 80s shoot em up flick the premise is borrowed from a richard <UNK> aka stephen king short novel but <UNK> fairly strongly from its source material especially towards the end the book ends rather <UNK> needless to say this movie doesn't i enjoyed both but i like the movie better br br my favorite line guess it's caused from <UNK>
<START> well the writing was very sloppy the directing was <UNK> and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra <UNK> was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn't really worth seeing and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not <UNK> bad but i wouldn't <UNK> it i gave it 2 out of 10 b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character justin i believe the super smart one and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a <UNK> with cheap <UNK> tape it was not pretty anyway if you see it wait for the 1 50 theater or video unless you like pretty much every movie you see then i guess you'll like this one
<START> i saw this film at a time when i was <UNK> <UNK> with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously i believed totally in the poor character's psychological <UNK> inside a paris of <UNK> construction sites dust <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i'm giving all the credit to <UNK> artistry in his direction his playing and his <UNK> script but i <UNK> during the horrible final scene and had to be <UNK> by <UNK> in the office of the <UNK> manager luckily for me my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this so far but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such <UNK> and so totally <UNK> himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey simply put the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race this film is the sum of many many instances of great acting and great casting as some performances were done in english the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others and others in french with most other characters and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french i <UNK> recommend if you happen to be <UNK> to switch the audio from french to english and vice versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd this film is part of <UNK> so called apartment building trilogy which also <UNK> <UNK> and rosemary's baby unfortunately <UNK> still hasn't made it to a decent dvd transfer in region 1 needless to say the three films would make a magnificent <UNK>
<START> i have lost count of just how many times i have seen this movie i probably know the entire dialog backwards yet i am drawn to it time and again br br set in <UNK> a young jimmy stewart plays the <UNK> bachelor <UNK> who becomes the secret admirer of margaret <UNK> innocent <UNK> <UNK> secretly becomes <UNK> pen friend and at work together <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> about the content of his <UNK> letters clearly <UNK> is <UNK> with <UNK> but is unable to make his feelings known whilst he is in competition with the pen friend confused well you wont be this story has a sweet almost <UNK> ending but we all know it is the ending we all want br br other characters worth mentioning are frank morgan playing his usual role this time as the <UNK> owner hugo <UNK> felix <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> joseph <UNK> as the <UNK> arrogant <UNK> so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning br br finally william tracy who manages to <UNK> himself to us all with his over confident <UNK> of a shop junior <UNK> <UNK> br br recently re made as you've got mail starring tom hanks meg ryan for me is not as good as the original although i suspect younger audiences would disagree br br if this film is on in your area over christmas i suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine put a <UNK> on the fire and have a box of <UNK> handy
<START> this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women <UNK> about everything to each other br br the first five listed actors in here are women so that <UNK> that it's really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime network br br there was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me br br by the way sally field looked about 15 years old in here
<START> scarecrows seems to be a <UNK> horror meets supernatural film a group of thugs pull off a <UNK> like robbery of the <UNK> at camp <UNK> in california they high jack a <UNK> plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be <UNK> to mexico along the way one greedy <UNK> decides to <UNK> with the money landing in a <UNK> <UNK> by strange looking scarecrows these aren't just any run of the mill scarecrows they can kill the acting is no better than the horrible dialog and the attempts at humor are not funny very low budget and shot entirely in the dark br br the cast includes ted <UNK> michael david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> b j turner phil <UNK> and victoria christian
<START> i stumbled onto this movie when i was <UNK> <UNK> palace stuff as i'm <UNK> with its rich vegas history as the last of the original luxury <UNK> still standing in good condition unless you count <UNK> the original mgm grand in that respect this movie delivers full force you're given a grand tour of the <UNK> property which in spite of all the <UNK> and <UNK> they've done over the 40 years it's been open looks <UNK> similar as a film overall the plot is somewhat difficult to follow thanks in large part to the horrendous editing and when i say horrendous i'm not using that word lightly there's a lot of spliced in second long snippets of vegas traffic casino crowds and even a scene where the robert <UNK> character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up and without any explanation he <UNK> goes in those infamous snippets from being himself to a baby to a little boy and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father that doesn't give away any plot details if anything one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as <UNK> as i was by the editing the film has aged well otherwise and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion
<START> the woman in black is fantastic in all aspects it's scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life i first saw this on the tv back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy and now i make sure to bring it out every halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they're in for and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film br br it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur <UNK> who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of <UNK> <UNK> to settle the papers of a recently deceased client mrs alice <UNK> br br this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then arthur <UNK> the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finale br br a warning to all new viewers though do not watch this alone
<START> relentlessly stupid no budget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve meyer not a bad idea in itself but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that wouldn't pass <UNK> in an <UNK> school christmas <UNK> inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde <UNK> who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy a philosophical <UNK> on the <UNK> of war or a <UNK> t a by early 1960s standards anyway <UNK> of eve <UNK> magnificent body and a general air of <UNK> and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer <UNK> her stuff but that's pretty much it
<START> one of the <UNK> of low budget cinema is taking a well known classic storyline and making a complete <UNK> out of it phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall however the <UNK> goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for <UNK> his face and murdering his family the special effects do provide a good chuckle especially when body parts begin appearing in <UNK> from the <UNK> stand <UNK> shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived if you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew check this flick out otherwise keep on looking for something else
<START> i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me i was rather surprised at the end though the american pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times yes it won't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as <UNK> as i enjoyed the original ones <UNK> house along with the previous two <UNK> definitely lost something that the first two <UNK> had it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did but what the hell it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school <UNK> house deserves 6 10 but i gave it 7 10 just for being another slice of pie
<START> it's not my fault my girlfriend made me watch it br br there is nothing positive to say about this film there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can't there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only <UNK> an embarrassment all round br br
<START> the movie's premise is spooky a woman gets pregnant when <UNK> by a stranger in a bar br br but as soon as the movie begins a horrible opening scene <UNK> that this is a c type sci fi tv movie it's a big star trek and a bit x files but more than anything else it's boring br br when the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche it looked more like a 2 <UNK> in a bad sci fi tv series no suspense and no thrills but not for a lack of trying just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters br br don't waste your time
<START> a typical 70s italian coming of age film original and good music but with some quirks interesting but not fantastic photography poor and at times confused storyline e g the role of the wolf dog and where does the boy come from with poor dialogue nice ambiance br br the reason it is still relatively well known and sought after is probably the nude scenes including typical 70s pseudo <UNK> involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with an older teenage boy eva <UNK> and laura <UNK> it is interesting from a <UNK> political point of view to see how these <UNK> of very young <UNK> was considered acceptable and normal in the whole of europe and us 30 years ago whereas now it is more than taboo br br the story revolves round bullying of one girl laura by the other two characters and her discovery of sex a quite accurate representation of an aspect teenage life the character of eva <UNK> does not <UNK> to the very end of the film and already appears very <UNK> in the erotic arts there is no coming of age for her she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms but ultimately is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really still is the boy is an utterly despicable bully while laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim
<START> the title says it all br br i'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the <UNK> people commenting on this movie br br obviously this movie didn't have a multi million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd br br i'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films br br dylan <UNK> cast and crew i thank you
<START> this is good little shocker not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but tight competent and disturbing an excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script br br the set up requires no <UNK> and <UNK> no lengthy exposition or <UNK> back story kate <UNK> <UNK> a young german business woman living in london <UNK> off whilst waiting for the last tube train she <UNK> to find the place deserted but quickly comes to realise that she is far from alone someone or something is down there with her and it's intentions are wholly <UNK> br br in fact she encounters several other characters in her quest to survive including a <UNK> work colleague a homeless couple and a <UNK> <UNK> worker all of whom add pace and substance to the plot there is a slightly awkward gear change somewhere in the middle of the film when tension thriller <UNK> into gore fest but nothing so clumsy as to slow the <UNK> pace for those of you with weak <UNK> this is likely to be a harrowing ride for those of you who <UNK> a bit of well executed <UNK> mayhem this should press all the right buttons br br the climax of the film is perhaps less successful than the main body of the film but it is <UNK> with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary which provides a satisfying conclusion br br some may find themselves feeling somewhat cheated of a clear explanation as to the exact nature and history of the threat encountered by kate and her <UNK> however for me this was not the case a horror film writer should not need feel compelled to <UNK> every i and cross every t in the same way a writer of political thrillers might be expected to there are enough clues here to give you a very pretty clear idea of what brought this evil into existence making a detailed and <UNK> solution superfluous the <UNK> of a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the ride was always going to be more important than the exact destination br br my understanding is that the budget for this film was to say the least minimal in which case our applause for this british horror should be all the <UNK> for at no point does one have the impression of <UNK> being cut or effects failing to deliver br br if this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is buy a ticket and climb aboard
<START> i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing br br ethan hawke and julie <UNK> are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple br br the movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart br br this has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece
<START> i know that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of br br <UNK> it's a direct <UNK> of the best years of our lives br br and the men films dealing with men who are in the hospital br br dealing with tragic circumstances but this film is full of wonderful br br surprises and performances it features stellar performances from br br eric <UNK> and helen hunt including a rather <UNK> nude scene br br and wesley snipes and william forsythe as <UNK> levy wrote br br in his book cinema of <UNK> about the independent film br br movement the <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> to detail and br br <UNK> with a wicked down to earth humor <UNK> s at once br br funny and sad and the entire cast is impressive i was br br extraordinarily moved by this film it's hard hitting yes but also has br br very tender moments and laugh out loud moments a rare gem
<START> ok so here's the basic plot it is 1933 peter sellers is dr fu <UNK> a <UNK> year old chinese man who has lived quite a long time the film opens with his birthday in which he <UNK> by drinking a special <UNK> that even the film never mentions <UNK> his life well on this occasion the <UNK> is clumsily dropped by an assistant <UNK> if you remember the pink <UNK> movies and he orders his <UNK> to then go find 6 rare items to make the <UNK> this creates a global man hunt in which his henchmen end up robbing <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> into london to meet up with dr <UNK> <UNK> a retired scotland yard detective <UNK> smith also played by sellers who tries to stop him in what is suppose to be a witty comedic adventure br br this was <UNK> sellers last full length feature film that he made before he died the terrible tragedy is that he was in it sellers who is such a gifted comedian and has had memorable <UNK> roles in the <UNK> movies and <UNK> in the movie 'the <UNK> is anything but that in this film this film was absolute torture to sit through and i couldn't even finish it he <UNK> dies and i kept cringing while watching sellers performance after coming of the great work of <UNK> <UNK> a year earlier how i mean how can he make this and how did this thing even get made like one person mentioned the first 10 15 minutes are ok but then it is all downhill br br avoid like the plague br br rating 1 out of 10
<START> stalker is right girl sees guy girl wants guy girl <UNK> mundane ways to keep <UNK> into him girl won't leave him alone girl pretends to be a patient girl can't stop talking about him girl pretends to love another guy or two he doesn't pay attention to her because she's annoying girl still won't leave him alone played right <UNK> character could have been charming but she's completely wholly <UNK> in her pursuit of cary <UNK> character her girlfriend in <UNK> is dull and sadly <UNK> attempt at playing <UNK> screwball comes off as <UNK> demented grant is himself as usual which is fine for cary but it's as close to a <UNK> in performance as i've ever seen from him the direction is lackluster and the dialog is just plain dim br br screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails like in this <UNK> out butt of an attempt it just stinks worse still drake spends the entire film in need of a lot of <UNK> and a <UNK> order she ruins any humor to be found in this <UNK> than mummy dust <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> contains a few scenes that <UNK> intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer joanna <UNK> is compelling as novelist <UNK> <UNK> and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies though why movies never use her real life <UNK> is difficult to explain but these elements don't add up to a successful whole the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes the <UNK> between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted but not so hard on the big picture several minor characters don't need to be there and don't behave consistently the basic plot is full of <UNK> e g why does thomas <UNK> think it's a good idea to tell <UNK> something he really doesn't want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome i'd like to think a trip on <UNK> <UNK> was more fun than the movie <UNK> davies is <UNK> as a standard <UNK> <UNK> type which isn't really accurate and the <UNK> ideas about chaplin and love are implausible br br strangely bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the thirties in paper moon lacks a similar <UNK> for the <UNK> he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e g yes we have no <UNK> when <UNK> insists everybody <UNK> <UNK> it looks as if the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot br br the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies i'm sure but not this time
<START> every once in a while a group of friends with a minimal budget but <UNK> of enthusiasm and talent will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm <UNK> and co did it with the evil dead jackson and pals succeeded with bad taste and <UNK> and <UNK> made a <UNK> with the blair witch project br br director todd sheets and his <UNK> however are destined to <UNK> forever in relative obscurity if zombie bloodbath is anything to go by a lesson in how not to make a <UNK> horror this miserable effort about a plague of flesh eating <UNK> serves as a reminder that whilst many people these days have access to a video camera most shouldn't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full length movie br br it's not that sheets hasn't got an eye for a nicely framed shot some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good but rather that a he has a lousy script b he has a lousy cast and c he doesn't realise that he has a lousy script and cast which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film <UNK> like me or members of the cast and crew like those who have given the film <UNK> comments br br zombie bloodbath is obviously aimed at <UNK> gore <UNK> and sheets who currently has an incredible <UNK> titles under his belt as a director certainly goes out of his way to please with <UNK> of <UNK> and blood thrown about at every opportunity but whilst these moments are undeniably <UNK> they aren't particularly convincing and soon get rather tedious br br so to <UNK> this is a really bad film with almost no redeeming features except for two br br firstly it features the single greatest <UNK> in the history of film as <UNK> by jerry <UNK> who plays larry as well as several zombies the <UNK> of his <UNK> coupled with a <UNK> <UNK> is reason alone to watch this film br br secondly it has <UNK> stealth <UNK> flesh eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by before <UNK> from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack which requires almost no effort to escape from best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it <UNK> stealth <UNK> also occasionally hide behind low walls or sit in <UNK> posing as members of the <UNK> br br normally a film this bad would get 1 10 for me but in celebration of jerry <UNK> flowing locks i will <UNK> raise my rating to 2 10
<START> holes is not your average disney stuff it's very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the <UNK> focus group designed family entertainment that uncle <UNK> studio passes off as live action perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its <UNK> to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff the action begins when stanley <UNK> is sent to a <UNK> prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of <UNK> but as the story progresses <UNK> tale becomes <UNK> with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all boy prison camp has any right to be jon voight is especially nasty and colorful and <UNK> weaver is beautiful as always
<START> i remember first watching sabrina when it came to tv in the uk on <UNK> when i was 13 14 i'm now 24 and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it i get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a kids show but i don't care lol caroline <UNK> as <UNK> is my personal favourite character and later on morgan also became another of my favourite characters i remember spending so much time watching various special events <UNK> sabrina on the tv station <UNK> uk i love <UNK> joan hart she was great in <UNK> explains all but so much better in this i was <UNK> when they decided to finish it i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk i'll be first in line lol x
<START> i don't know if i'd consider it a masterpiece of not but it's damn near close it's extremely well made artistic suspenseful <UNK> plotted <UNK> challenging and full of bleak <UNK> and sexual religious imagery there's also some great camera work from jan de <UNK> an atmospheric score from <UNK> <UNK> and outstanding acting from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the latter giving one of the most <UNK> subtle <UNK> <UNK> performance i've ever seen like many other european movies this movie has an <UNK> non <UNK> attitude toward sex nudity and the <UNK> of sexuality and has zero <UNK> about mixing it all up with religious and or <UNK> some would say <UNK> images in other words if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust driven homosexual <UNK> the object of his <UNK> desire as jesus <UNK> on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess it mixes the abstract surreal parallel fantasy reality scenes and somehow makes it all work like any good mystery you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses there is not an out of left field resolution here the movie has direction there's no needless filler and once it concludes you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch i can almost guarantee you will love this movie hell <UNK> have no idea who they even are you still might like it br br i'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed but the film's opening shot through a web as a spider catches its prey sets the stage as <UNK> as <UNK> smug <UNK> writer gerard <UNK> interestingly also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on crosses paths with a wealthy mysterious sexy woman named christine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> simon like innocence <UNK> that's pretty unnerving who may be a literal <UNK> <UNK> responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands the two become lovers and move in with one another but we're led to believe through <UNK> bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman played by <UNK> de <UNK> who may or may not actually exist something terrible is <UNK> under the surface when another of <UNK> lovers the young and beautiful herman <UNK> hoffman shows up at the house things take an unexpected turn and that's all you need to know br br the 4th man was a huge art house success in much of the world but didn't make it over to the us until 1984 where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association the most common video is the media release which has been horribly dubbed try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release since coming to america verhoeven's career has had its ups and downs he has made a few decent films flesh blood <UNK> and some lousy ones <UNK> in fact verhoeven's big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting junior league version of the fourth man <UNK> also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets 1989 and eve of destruction 1991 were the best offers she was getting she headed right back home to the <UNK>
<START> what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell sgt todd only has <UNK> lines and something like <UNK> words what a challenge like a black and white photo when your <UNK> eye has to fill in the <UNK> the facial expressions the physical drama the <UNK> gesture all combines to make a stronger impact this is one of those top 5 movies i can't live without right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this check out mad max 2 the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell <UNK> and connie <UNK> who was in soldier also the <UNK> warrior starring antonio <UNK> and blade runner starring harrison ford
<START> i did not enjoy the film joshua at all perhaps it is because i saw another much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good i am going with the ladder sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring <UNK> and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than <UNK> wasn't very <UNK> when it was all over br br at the end <UNK> motivations are revealed i won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite vera <UNK> as his mother <UNK> disappearing about 3 4th through the movie all <UNK> point to her returning home soon she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then <UNK> father her husband was accused of <UNK> with her <UNK> which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being <UNK> <UNK> so shouldn't she be coming home soon won't joshua have failed won't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon i question the father since his future is left open ended br br at the end of the day i didn't care about the characters the evil demon child joshua wasn't really scary the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring suspense fell flat every single time when it was over i couldn't believe i had sat through the whole thing br br 4 10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera <UNK> as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil <UNK> go see orphan now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie
<START> seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didn't have much expectations when renting this film br br but contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didn't need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies br br there's not a lot of <UNK> jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film br br very recommended
<START> good actors and good performances can't mask a pointless script bad dialogue and <UNK> of behavior <UNK> into nothing you'd care about the most interesting character is david <UNK> no character development no growth no interest just some suffering for no particular reason teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain
<START> julia ross nina <UNK> agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her almost immediately she is drugged and <UNK> off to the family's estate in <UNK> when she <UNK> they keep telling her she's marion hughes has been mentally ill and keep her locked up but why you'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun br br along with the narrow <UNK> and face behind the mask this is one of the best b pictures ever made b pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars it's just as long as it needs to be only <UNK> minutes is well directed fast paced and exciting it only stumbles at the end which i found a bit too implausible to buy br br <UNK> a good actress is just ok in the lead but dame may witty is great and george <UNK> is excellent and frightening as the villains well worth catching a perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget
<START> first of all i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better from the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour imagine actual comedies were made movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny as opposed to long dark depressing and boring br br during the 90's and <UNK> several really great movies were made by a <UNK> <UNK> of filmmakers movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money it became the norm br br then came united br br minor spoilers it's just simply not funny not once not ever but the thing is we think its funny because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians but they neither say nor do anything funny where's the humor show me the humor is it the awkward clerk played by <UNK> <UNK> is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach is it the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> the movie is just not funny br br but thats not my main rant about united that namely is the predictability and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a <UNK> since i have seen this in many other movies as well all the time you just know its going to end well all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end there's absolutely no room for surprises at all br br all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making again br br rating 1 6
<START> i heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good but i started watching the film on my film channel and was interested this could be a really great darkly black satire on todays morals in media the small <UNK> on every <UNK> were good it build up to something i wouldn't wanna miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible cheap and rather silly here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb br br the ending is so bad i give it a 1 even if the film starts of promising
<START> finally i got to see the infamous ice age apart from maybe not being as dead funny as i'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant <UNK> there is not a bad word i can say about it sure it's not as glamorous as a disney production besides it is <UNK> 1st attempt at a full length cg movie but it's got immense heart and on some occasions like the look in <UNK> eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past i found myself on the verge of tears but when they reunited the baby with its father i just couldn't hold them in anymore a movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it the end result being one of the most touching animated creations i have ever seen great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you and great voice talents as well and many funny memorable scenes especially from <UNK> behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go plus the <UNK> scene which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002 br br i honestly don't get it but for some reason it really looks like cg animation will be taking the upper hand in the future but if it just means that there will be more movies like this one and who can forget <UNK> creations then i don't really mind at least for now 9 10
<START> the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by ned beatty <UNK> cox bill <UNK> and though he appeared only briefly james <UNK> the man who <UNK> the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of <UNK> it is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be <UNK> from it but this is great dramatic cinema
<START> great movie especially the music <UNK> james at last this speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone
<START> personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this <UNK> little gem way back in the eighties the early eighties i discovered this movie like so many released at the time night <UNK> bad manners or even king frat the artwork and <UNK> on the back of the covers tempted and <UNK> you br br of course being of an age movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like <UNK> and the many others captured the imagination and thankfully many years later i still remember some with <UNK> and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or <UNK> br br made many years after the huge success of animal house and having seen how it had <UNK> down through the years i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever <UNK> the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it <UNK> in the memory much like that of national <UNK> vacation br br to be honest not everything that has carried the national lampoon <UNK> has been a wild success however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies with instantly <UNK> characters such as the <UNK> bob <UNK> played to perfection by <UNK> graham so good in charles <UNK> <UNK> still lingering in the past <UNK> of his youth or how about stephen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum <UNK> downs br br sweet as which makes me <UNK> as i already said personal taste not <UNK> people can be so cruel so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of <UNK> peers within the comedy world it does have some merit being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work weird science as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u s bonds br br what more can i say it's a movie just waiting to be <UNK> time and time again
<START> well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is <UNK> call me ignorant for not knowing of <UNK> book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but don't blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of <UNK> in jungle <UNK> i certainly didn't expect an hour and forty five minutes of one old <UNK> kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didn't expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not <UNK> myself laughing so hard at <UNK> <UNK> and all of his off putting glory br br <UNK> is indeed unlikable the old man just <UNK> and <UNK> the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn't even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding <UNK> dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when <UNK> finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in <UNK> and say that he had a small piece that's it folks ninety minutes of bull later and <UNK> <UNK> is a cannibal by three <UNK> it's like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievable br br the directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didn't read <UNK> volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute <UNK> is talking about cruise ships and <UNK> and the next he's going on and on about how he can't drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a <UNK> look into his visit to <UNK> also i don't particularly care much for <UNK> insipid little <UNK> on life and living but i at least <UNK> the old man to keep consistent with his <UNK> if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don't expect him to suddenly bitch and <UNK> about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurd br br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has <UNK> the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old <UNK> br br the bottom line here is that <UNK> <UNK> is a fraud pure and simple i know that i haven't read the book but i'm still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the <UNK> that the viewer is already an avid fan of <UNK> work and instead goes on from that <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> found on a dvd <UNK> is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un riveting if you're looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and <UNK> turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious self serving rant over a man who is long <UNK> for a straight jacket and a gag
<START> this movie had me smiling from beginning to end partly at the humor partly at meg ryan this is the perfect character for her and always because it's just one of the best feel good movies i've seen hopefully the dvd will be out soon
<START> this is how i feel about the show br br i started watching the show in reruns in 2001 br br i enjoy the show but it had too many faults br br i hate the michelle joey characters br br stealing story lines from old tv shows they even stole from the <UNK> family then in 1 episode the <UNK> family was mentioned br br actors playing different roles in different episodes mtv martha quinn the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episode br br the michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on her br br story lines that came went in 1 episode joey getting the tv show with frankie <UNK> never heard from it again after that danny all of a sudden playing the guitar 1 episode he is <UNK> soccer 1 episode he is <UNK> <UNK> baseball 1 game you are out huh danny br br jesse joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience only in a tv show br br i did like the d j stephanie characters wish jodie <UNK> could have learned from <UNK> cameron <UNK> had a clean non drug adult life
<START> some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies <UNK> it's roots back to double <UNK> and the <UNK> always rings twice in the 40's this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90's nick cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets <UNK> in a husband wife murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of red rock west lots of twists and turns great performances by cage hopper and walsh an hypnotic slide guitar musical backdrop and <UNK> directing make this a real joy favorite line when cage looks at the empty gas <UNK> in the get away car shakes his head and says f <UNK> story of my life
<START> from the beginning of the show carmen was there she was one of the best characters why did they get rid of her the show not the same as before its way worse br br the best episodes were with carmen in them you can't replace someone from the beginning that is like south park without kyle or child's play without <UNK> it's not right the niece who replaced her is just ugh awful she doesn't fit into the storyline at all she was one of the main characters and the niece can't replace her she was an awesome actress way better than the niece get her back or you'll lose a ton of viewers
<START> my <UNK> 8 10 br br i like a lot this movie compare to today brainless movie just action and special <UNK> and nothing new about ideas soylent green ask to something that today doesn't exist anymore to think br br well it would not a big surprise a day human eat <UNK> which are create with body of human with all what happen on this planet and to see how people are so indifferent to all this kind of future is possible br br sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again rich at paradise other in the hell well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like reality show br br tv is a good wash brain it's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like <UNK> since writing all stop br br if you like reality show this movie is not for you if you believe all politician same too if you don't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie
<START> the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia brooke <UNK> <UNK> marshall jeff <UNK> who have tried for the last five years to <UNK> virginia has had two <UNK> since then is desperate to have a child they visit dr richard <UNK> james karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends dr <UNK> says he will be able to help them have a child dr <UNK> <UNK> on virginia it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success virginia is pregnant at first everything seems perfect the <UNK> couldn't be happier but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as <UNK> <UNK> develops problems she becomes moody acts totally out of character she receives a worrying phone call from beth jane cameron another woman who has <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> who claims that <UNK> is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends is in fact a <UNK> genetic <UNK> virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her br br produced directed by <UNK> <UNK> i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror thriller it's definitely not a sci fi film as the imdb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me the script by henry dominic tries to be different it must take some credit for that at least the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares bad special effects it's got quite a clever story that works plays on basic human fears it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means the climax was good seemed a fitting way to round things off the <UNK> about messing around with <UNK> seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then maybe <UNK> knew something the rest of us didn't on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times also i have to mention it what on <UNK> was that <UNK> black <UNK> dwarf all about eh br br director <UNK> does an ok job the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough the atmosphere is good there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her dr <UNK> sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment <UNK> the blood gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it br br technically the film is ok i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland forgettable the baby creature is actually a decent special effect has fairly realistic facial movement the acting is good this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends 1994 2004 star lisa <UNK> i have to be honest i don't like friends i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did br br the unborn is a good horror thriller that deserves to be more widely known seen it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that <UNK> video shop shelves if your a horror fan are looking for something a bit different something slightly more intelligent thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn followed by a <UNK> down sequel the unborn ii 1994 which i watched straight after this check my review out if you want
<START> the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a <UNK> city of busy quaint streets and sunshine i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets <UNK> down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere br br othello works for big fat mr <UNK> his crime boss step dad at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it's never really defined but he does drop <UNK> into deep fat <UNK> so trust me he's a <UNK> doing <UNK> little <UNK> while his <UNK> girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs one of his colleagues is runner a black dude who is always dashing from a to b until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who <UNK> him his wish of being able to stop running runner <UNK> the lost boy in <UNK> flat where he promptly starts <UNK> more wishes keen to have some of his own desires <UNK> <UNK> has the boy kidnapped but he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job either way i don't want to see the little boy grant him the second br br it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes the ending tries to be shocking but since there's hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience br br writer tony <UNK> a favourite of terry gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film as it is we are introduced to a bunch of annoying <UNK> who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy who's origins are never revealed that's just plain irritating br br aside from <UNK> moments of atmosphere and a moody score this film has little to recommend
<START> if you look at corey <UNK> information here on imdb apparently there's a movie called <UNK> in production as of june <UNK> in which he's playing a character named sebastian cole br br first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didn't sebastian get killed at the end of loaded br br i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was <UNK> in and out while it was on i'm sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak <UNK> performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film i'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional
<START> during a kurt <UNK> celebration in brooklyn where do we go from here was finally <UNK> for a screening it is amazing that a motion picture from any era that has <UNK> gershwin <UNK> can possibly be missing from the screens the score stands tall and a cd of the material with gershwin and <UNK> only <UNK> its merits which are considerable yes the film has its problems but the score is not one of them <UNK> is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy and fred macmurray cannot quite grasp the material then too the <UNK> segment is <UNK> written but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies joan leslie and june <UNK> both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work as a world war ii <UNK> to our country's history albeit in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits
<START> welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack where we'll see that's right another movie that makes absolutely no sense seriously this movie had me so confused at the end i thought i was <UNK> at dawn they sleep the plot seems simple enough well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then um explodes i have no idea what happened and that was before the title screen that's really sad when i can't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes br br anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after <UNK> his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere so we get there but not before somebody steals their <UNK> to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town suspicious <UNK> so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to he gets lost and then finds his way back br br oh i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that <UNK> eyed guy from casablanca then they leave there's really no point to this scene it's really just padding if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared br br but sadly that was actually the best part of the movie wait let me <UNK> that really sadly that was the best part of the movie because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened but of course no one else knows so i'm <UNK> br br seriously the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most <UNK> moments i've ever seen on film they dressed her up in a dress he gets kidnapped then released he runs back to the house then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends seriously i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie i mean as bad as movies such as war of the robots are at least they make sense this movie doesn't even make the attempt to be coherent the ending was as confusing as the end of at dawn they sleep and the plot was much more boring this movie gets a 1 just for its sheer i have no idea what happened in this movie <UNK> witches mountain gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10
<START> there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its <UNK> which is extremely flawed it simply continues to <UNK> <UNK> style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional <UNK> and <UNK> of negative <UNK> br br <UNK> 101 tell the viewer some fact only in order to <UNK> them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos <UNK> etc were all supposedly unexpected <UNK> to the collapse of <UNK> <UNK> following <UNK> demise were these not all <UNK> of an already <UNK> culture <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> of these <UNK> of islam itself rather than a failure in police force to <UNK> and secure would they rather the us have <UNK> marshall law i'm sure the papers here would've <UNK> with <UNK> of a police state and fascist force br br aside from the <UNK> idiocy of the film it takes a few <UNK> and leaves the rest out claiming so and so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred <UNK> those individuals have already received would you as vice president <UNK> to be interviewed by a first time writer producer which was most certainly already <UNK> to twist your words they couldn't roll tape of <UNK> to actually show her opinion and answer some of the <UNK> of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearing br br this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased <UNK> approach by <UNK> which are by and large <UNK> <UNK> br br anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and <UNK> commentary these interpretations <UNK> of the same <UNK> which simply creates a further <UNK> of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think
<START> for the first time in years i've felt the need to <UNK> into imdb today to <UNK> myself of this movie by writing a review because it was just such a let down to watch the plot sounded awesome when i read it i expected a minimal mystery thriller a claustrophobic phantom hunt unfortunately it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane <UNK> love story and too many contrived and teeth <UNK> stupid no one says things like this except in bad movies dialogs that it's just <UNK> br br here's a quick run down of the worst <UNK> of this piece of film br br the script relies so heavily on <UNK> and the inexplicable and <UNK> stupidity of the main characters that it's just laughable no actually it's <UNK> and lazy br br related to that cheap thrills a long parade just in time moments br br the main characters alright it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies thus his characters are boring lifeless second generation clichés they are mere plot devices place <UNK> without the slightest bit of personality they are man and woman in break up who still love each other never seen that one before except in 100 000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable think of the <UNK> two dimensional hollywood fare and you've got it there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh charming or interesting br br the far fetched vague resolution that's <UNK> very bad and needs just one <UNK> to <UNK> though the word resolution might be ill fitting here because the movie is a <UNK> mess that isn't going anywhere anyway by the time you're through though you don't care anymore the last third of the movie i just fast <UNK> because it was just so unbearable to watch br br okay that's it whatever redeeming features this movie has it all gets buried under incompetence don't watch this turd
<START> i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently in my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sour br br the story a u s soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u s has sent out to troops for christmas he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on when he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in he comes across and <UNK> young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card he meets the family and after saving her dad a vietnam war veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while we learn that he doesn't have a family back home the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their <UNK> company the family comes to love him and vice versa the soldier also becomes in love with the family's daughter the woman that sent the christmas card there's only one problem she already has a serious relationship with a man that she's in love with it's also a long distance relationship the boyfriend is very different from the soldier he prefers wine and <UNK> to france over hard labor and the great <UNK> the woman prefers the latter throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the woman's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what's best for her daughter spoiler alert the woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common they happen to spend a lot of time together she gradually becomes attracted to his persona then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back now she's so confused she's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but she's become so fond of the soldier soon enough the boyfriend who doesn't know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to <UNK> to the woman and she accepts his plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants she wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family he wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along this doesn't sound too thrilling for the woman however the soldier feels bad about what he's done and doesn't want to make things worse so he decides to leave town despite the <UNK> <UNK> him to stay and be with his daughter it all comes to a head when at the christmas eve service with church we find out that the soldier hasn't left yet the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he broken hearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together br br things i like i like the soldier throughout much of the film he's basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with church and <UNK> in <UNK> causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br things i don't like there is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically <UNK> this behavior the family goes with church and <UNK> in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language br br conclusion i became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse i ended up fast <UNK> the very end of the film because i had enough so the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself therefore i don't recommend this film to anyone
<START> spoiler alert br br i had just watched the extended version of <UNK> and <UNK> though i did like the extended version i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd br br the <UNK> road could have been cut down to the <UNK> length it was too long and dragged the movie along though the dancing is great would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene br br all in all this is a great movie my 5 year old liked it and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation this and mary <UNK> are added to my collection br br just as i had remembered br br out of br br
<START> i have a high tolerance for the weird but frankly some movies go way way beyond weird so far that they make your brain hurt this is such a film trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking drugs it's that incomprehensible br br the film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat however out of the blue tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur making me wonder if i am losing something in the translation however even if this is so why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving <UNK> a lady with a clever <UNK> <UNK> lighting animals on fire etc all this really seemed random and pretty awful oddly and i don't know why some see this as a work of genius i just don't get that
<START> this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes <UNK> around the modern industrial growth of china edward <UNK> brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore br br taking no political sides this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to <UNK> us about the by products of <UNK> growth the <UNK> paid by citizens of the lesser developed <UNK> the source of our <UNK> and the wastes of our <UNK> <UNK> br br amazing heart breaking impossible to ignore this is a challenging journey but one worth taking please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues 10 10 definitely
<START> this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad acting bad plot bad casting bad directing bad cinematography if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn't have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood don't waste your time
<START> the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are <UNK> of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of <UNK> <UNK> character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way <UNK> did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that i'd like to believe that it is an insomnia <UNK> movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to sleep br br keep in mind this is a deaf guy talking
<START> bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesn't get any better than this <UNK> over acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such don't miss ray <UNK> debut film line looks like a penis
<START> sorry but aside from kim basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers i've seen in awhile logic is thrown out as 4 young guys <UNK> this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard yet no one seems to notice then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit i can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs carrying a red <UNK> screaming for god to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well
<START> 0 's christian slater tara reid stephen <UNK> frank c turner <UNK> walker will <UNK> directed by uwe boll br br based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action packed nail <UNK> sadly he doesn't succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen <UNK> his movie lacks the necessary <UNK> that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic <UNK> of what's going on in the dark and the light the movie <UNK> all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the <UNK> were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating 0 10
<START> i have always wanted to see this because i love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this i was sure the incredible melting man would be a lot of fun br br it really wasn't i mean the acting was <UNK> bad the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had <UNK> all over the lead actor so i should have loved it unfortunately it's really <UNK> between these highlights i decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return that's how boring this film is br br nevertheless if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the fat nurse and the stellar acting of the guy who plays dr ted to be fair to the poor man he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the i m man br br i'll find him with a <UNK> counter is he <UNK> just a little bit br br yes the plot has dr ted wandering about trying to find a <UNK> zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini <UNK> he's a brave man unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of <UNK> on a tree oh god it's his ear says dr ted to the audience i'm so glad he <UNK> that up br br i realise i'm making this movie sound rather fun it would be if it were only 10 minutes long but unfortunately it goes on and on and the incredible melting dude just <UNK> about making a <UNK> mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion i think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it just don't have pop <UNK> during the movie because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end
<START> i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie simon <UNK> made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide and even though this was his only film he is what made the movie so great at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide then i found out due to the current <UNK> at www imdb com he was born in 1957 in <UNK> <UNK> simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man but his real life self certainly had their <UNK> and weaknesses he did a good acting job who can disagree i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade i agree with some <UNK> like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered and that high schools do not have bath <UNK> i think caroline <UNK> who was <UNK> at the time was the only other star that had any <UNK> acting talent and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films the reason s for his suicide are a mystery and hopefully will be discovered in the near future doing the <UNK> on his <UNK> it tells you he was <UNK> years old when he made slaughter high he looked like a teenager i give this film two thumbs up the best horror film made probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business <UNK> young

<START> i was eager to see mr fix it because i'm a huge david <UNK> fan what i got though was a 1 1 2 hour <UNK> the premise seemed enjoyable <UNK> is lance <UNK> <UNK> of a business called mr fix it where dumped men <UNK> his help to get their girlfriends to take them back br br among the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting although i've found <UNK> delightful in his other film roles with the exception of that crow movie he did this was disappointing at times his character was interesting and others flat the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasn't a big budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right br br my advice watch at your own risk

<START> set in south africa a young black guy tries to land a part in a <UNK> movie but with no knowledge of street life he's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part he manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted but for the <UNK> leader the <UNK> disaster of his new friend's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own br br while that may sound relatively interesting it's anything but the first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious while the <UNK> only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases in those chases only two police cars are used both of which are early 90's <UNK> <UNK> not only would these be rather cheap to pick up and i find it rather hard to believe they'd be using such mundane old cars in south africa in the year 2000 but as far as i can remember there's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once the car chases are very badly shot with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads and they're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily <UNK> the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly <UNK> this now leads me onto the characters and the acting which are equally bad the aforementioned kid who drives the car looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police everybody else is equally unconvincing so much that they even look bored at times themselves br br at the closing scene of the movie our main character sox <UNK> is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park while having trouble opening it the police arrive and ask him what he's doing and he replies by telling him it's their car after a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the police at <UNK> and jumps back in their car after he's in the police return fire and in turn he gets wounded after another pathetic chase sequence they decide to abandon the car and set it <UNK> to destroy any evidence what follows here is one of the most downright laughable and <UNK> awful special effects i've ever seen when the car explodes <UNK> flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time it's so badly done and so phony looking that it's hard to even put it into words and really needs to be seen to be believed if you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier i've seen better effects than this in murder <UNK> documentaries the car is a <UNK> golf <UNK> <UNK> something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion i'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was it feels so cheap that i'm surprised it made it outside of south africa and even more surprised it made it to a dvd release br br i know it's not a big budget hollywood production i know it's meant to depict gangs in <UNK> <UNK> of south africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market but with the laughable effects poorly executed car chases awful acting and ludicrous characters any sense of reality is completely lost br br overall i most certainly do not advise you to watch this if you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done low budget <UNK> of <UNK> ever created then i'd recommend it for that and only that br br it is a wretched poorly made poorly edited poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts i've seen many south african movies including lots of cheap <UNK> <UNK> world action pictures and despite their cheesiness they're far better than this on all counts
<START> i am not one of those who think king is a great writer his books are fine <UNK> for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought br br this film suffers from being a pretty exact re telling of king's story if you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no <UNK> of scenes or characters this is a film made by king fans for king fans br br for the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a <UNK> <UNK> horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner the final third has some severe <UNK> problems and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little br br there are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here br br
<START> i've been a jennifer <UNK> fan since <UNK> and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven i saw it as soon as i could the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer <UNK> it captivated my attention that this movie was <UNK> written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer <UNK> you to can not put off seeing this movie
<START> i first saw breaking glass when it was released in england in 1980 i loved it then and having just caught it in august 2005 on a canadian station it still is great the only thing i regret is i can't find the sound track or the dvd in the stores anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over <UNK> internet company but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time <UNK> kate had something to say about 80's britain actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being <UNK> and what she was doing to the country at the time please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry
<START> a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies <UNK> at the rental store and picking stuff just because i haven't seen it a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen br br long before <UNK> kazan turned himself into a brand <UNK> out only notable movies not good ones he made this better than average drama watching it you begin to notice how many decent good or nicely observed scenes have <UNK> contrast that with his later films where the drama is <UNK> large preferably large and <UNK> and <UNK> kazan was eventually more of a <UNK> <UNK> than a director um no thanks br br his future <UNK> are hinted at here only in the plot the plague is coming but here's an <UNK> richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the <UNK> of that <UNK> here's an almost watchable <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her <UNK> turned way down well for her they're a couple and they share some nicely written scenes about big <UNK> and smaller ones here's an expertly directed comic <UNK> with a <UNK> ships crew here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an <UNK> warehouse and a flock of birds shoots <UNK> <UNK> the moment these are the small scale <UNK> a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life something hollywood in its greed now <UNK> avoids these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them it's a <UNK> human <UNK> film not the grotesque <UNK> production that he and others david lean will later <UNK> whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br i just watched it twice and i'll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer this reminds me of both no way out a <UNK> noir with widmark as the villain and naked city which you should really get your hands on
<START> never see this movie br br it tries to be a spoof on scifi thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it <UNK> at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it br br it is very lame a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it this movie does not have any such aspect br br save yourself it's too late for me but just don't watch it

<START> i've watched this documentary twice and although i'm an major movie buff most documentaries don't hold my attention this film however was mesmerizing almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary which this documentary does not have br br the concept of this film is amazing i can't praise it enough <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who would have thought br br amazing and excellent choices of interviews film footage of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually there br br i'm political aware and i've read several books on <UNK> so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me however it's made me think so much br br i wish so much too that this world was a better place br br a million kudos to the filmmaker and thanks for making this film too br br i wish everyone could see it
<START> this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a <UNK> copy accept for it being an australian film with people who can't act br br once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake <UNK> now a number of years later the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video it is cliche ridden and a waste of time and money see it only out of curiosity or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to not be able to act lead role alan <UNK> used to star in the television soap opera <UNK> but ended up in the x files how did that happen
<START> is there a movement more <UNK> and more <UNK> than the <UNK> movement to a budding young <UNK> joining the circus must seem as <UNK> as joining a real circus even though such people normally <UNK> their brain to hollywood for these important issues the <UNK> of hollywood can often seem <UNK> and confusing fortunately ed is here to teach neo hippies in the art of <UNK> br br here you'll learn the art of <UNK> your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark <UNK> you'll learn how to <UNK> off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear you'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by <UNK> it as the <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> br br in addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to <UNK> off <UNK> that are <UNK> your way no matter how much of a <UNK> you are you'll be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were <UNK> br br in the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods holy be <UNK> names and <UNK> i e judge their <UNK> note this is the only time it's appropriate for an <UNK> to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy <UNK> toys so that they can <UNK> their finger in other people's faces br br what does ed have in store for us in season three maybe he'll teach us how to be <UNK> while sleeping
<START> i wasted my time and gave this show a chance this has to be one of the worst new shows if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should <UNK> the category the acting is poor and the story line is contrived now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining that show lasted three seasons and was finally <UNK> this new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the <UNK> characters
<START> this would have been what you got br br words alone cannot describe how bad this is if you're having trouble sleeping pop this in and i guarantee you'll be out in fifteen minutes br br robert <UNK> was a pretty good actor in the 40s but he's <UNK> it in here in an interview johnny <UNK> robin said that in one scene he and batman had to run from the car to the house and that <UNK> was <UNK> over out of camera range because his <UNK> was too tight <UNK> himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder in fact he's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for <UNK> to kick off so he can wear the big cape br br driving a <UNK> that looks like it rolled off honest <UNK> used car lot at below <UNK> price the dynamic duo don't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it's bruce wayne's car they're driving in fact it's noted by several characters throughout the serial br br the acting is wooden the sets are cheap the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following i'm sure it read along the lines of batman says something here because it certainly seems like they're making it up as it goes along br br <UNK> <UNK> belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent <UNK> to hold his <UNK> in one scene when batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just <UNK> one in as the scene starts never to be seen again his <UNK> is so bad he can't even see out of it and his ears look more like <UNK> <UNK> the disgruntled <UNK> rabbit than they do anything <UNK> br br in one scene i am not making this up batman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some <UNK> it's <UNK> so he can trace it the reason it's so highly <UNK> isn't explained well unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse we know it's a cardboard warehouse because batman <UNK> in and pushes these boxes that look to <UNK> about six <UNK> on the <UNK> to knock them out and soon the whole place burns to the ground thanks batman br br in another scene after the <UNK> is disabled batman <UNK> down a passing <UNK> in the middle of nowhere and takes his car leaving the man to <UNK> for himself and telling him not to worry because if batman <UNK> up the car the police will surely buy him another one yes you guessed it said car <UNK> off a cliff within a few short seconds not that it matters much to the <UNK> who has probably died from exposure trying to <UNK> his way back to <UNK> city br br there is a tired subplot with lois lane clone <UNK> <UNK> who is convinced bruce wayne is batman she must have noticed the <UNK> <UNK> outside of <UNK> house or maybe she saw batman and robin running up the walk in the clearly <UNK> populated suburban neighborhood br br everything about this serial is bad and all but the youngest in the audience will want to <UNK> <UNK> at the screen if you're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark if you want entertainment try the burton batman films the adam west batman tv series or the earlier lewis wilson batman serial
<START> i think it great example of the differences between two cultures it would be a great movie to show in a <UNK> class i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that lets band together and get the job done plot device it seems most people don't realize that this movie is not just a comedy it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely overall i give it a solid 8
<START> ok aside from the psychedelic background imagery the info presented here was good the music i could have done without not that it was bad music just that it didn't fit this film at all br br as for the content of the film the director brings up the often lacking <UNK> perspective on <UNK> existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of <UNK> life vs the lives of <UNK> figures <UNK> such as <UNK> and <UNK> then he brings up the <UNK> of <UNK> origins and presents an <UNK> case but not one that blew me away br br if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them this film would have been good however at this point in the film it <UNK> into a group of personally <UNK> attacks on mel <UNK> passion of the christ and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth during an interview with his old principal which during the course of it comes to light that the director set up under false <UNK> i felt that the director was acting sort of childish he was asking good questions but like the film itself the interview <UNK> into an attack on this particular private <UNK> rules not christianity br br all in all if you're just interested in some info watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off
<START> it's common practice for a film about <UNK> to be somewhat muted in style and tone there's a difference however between using restraint and <UNK> <UNK> among audience members in the secret lives of <UNK> starring campbell scott and hope davis director alan <UNK> plays as close to the <UNK> as possible with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a <UNK> on how teeth are a metaphor for married life br br scott gives a fine performance in the role of david <UNK> a dentist married to another dentist davis <UNK> sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly he is completely absorbed in the day to day duties of being the <UNK> she is quietly <UNK> with their frantic family life and then <UNK> up the tension when scott may or may not witness his wife with another man from this point on the film focuses on whether or not david is going to confront his wife dana about her possible adultery or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good from time to time david is treated to visits from an imaginary friend in the form of a former patient played by denis <UNK> <UNK> heavily from brad <UNK> tyler <UNK> in fight club br br while there is enough <UNK> about <UNK> infidelity and david's <UNK> to warrant examination the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative instead <UNK> creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the <UNK> family culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film's climax the film never picks up on the hints at what david is really capable of if he wasn't so dedicated to his family neither does it spend much time looking at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> act between her family life and her other more fulfilling ambitions br br by choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry <UNK> kills the momentum of his film by the time the fifth member of the family shows up <UNK> and <UNK> the film has used up all the good <UNK> of scott's well <UNK> performance david and dana end up <UNK> their steps over and over again until a less than <UNK> finale with nothing to build on over the last hour the conclusion seems awkward and <UNK> on the secret lives of <UNK> takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it altogether a disappointing unimaginative film
<START> a documentary without a loss for words ever br br let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof let us assume it is a commentary on japanese society and as this film is as fast paced an <UNK> documentary as they come the constant <UNK> as fast is it goes and as poorly translated as it is in its current festival <UNK> version as seen tonight at the <UNK> <UNK> it is still quite enjoyable br br but for the patient and only the truly patient and open minded i'm talking to you jim <UNK> fans with add <UNK> i believe this is a film for you it's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over br br quite beautiful and quite <UNK> and quite japanese sub culture and quite experimental static <UNK> in a 3d world all in all fun for those that want to see a japanese film that spoofs japanese food culture a thumbs up if you're in the mood for something completely different
<START> my super ex girlfriend turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me i was really expecting a horrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable and you know what it was but this movie did have so many wonderful laughs and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick out of i know that this was a very cheesy movie but uma and anna were just so cool and steve was such a great addition along with a great cast that looked like they had so much fun and that's what made the movie really work br br jenny johnson scary that's my best friend's actual name is not your typical average <UNK> looking woman when matt your average male asks her out he's in for more than he expected he's asked g girl out on a date the super hero of the world but when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it may be a good idea that they spend some time apart but jenny won't have it since he's fallen for another girl hannah and she will make his life a living hell i mean let's face it he couldn't have chosen a better girl to break up with br br the effect were corny but you seriously move past them quickly the story and cast made the story really work and i loved uma in this movie it was such a step up from prime my super ex girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously it's just a cute romantic comedy that i think if i could get a laugh out of it anyone could br br 7 10
<START> uneven bollywood drama <UNK> kapoor is excellent as an indian woman in canada who marries a friend <UNK> kapoor has a child and then visits his family in india only to find they are terrorist <UNK> drama and tragedy ensue and the film becomes a kind of not without my baby <UNK> thriller film is compelling its few song dance numbers are uninteresting and needless the <UNK> of bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film's drama at least once we've left the <UNK> confines of their canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> provocative if ultimately misplaced as well likewise the inclusion of bollywood superstar <UNK> khan as a happy go lucky drifter who helps kapoor in her escape from the <UNK> of the <UNK> turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about <UNK> that generate her cameo dance  are <UNK> with his throw away comic book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film's primary gripping drama the cast is nicely supported by <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> and the elegant <UNK> naval who is outstanding as his long suffering wife who finally <UNK> to stand up against him in one of the film's best scenes <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are also very good as <UNK> sisters in india and very pleasing eye candy but <UNK> himself overacts terribly especially during obvious ad <UNK> the directorial style of writer director <UNK> <UNK> is sloppy rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts although his camera movement is good the musical <UNK> is also quite effective moody featuring <UNK> female voice over a small <UNK> ensemble too bad little if any of that made it onto <UNK> soundtrack cd but bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums at least not in most cases but <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> film all the way though and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to india <UNK> nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with <UNK> in the initial canadian scenes despite the <UNK> of much of the picture <UNK> performance completely sells the film and <UNK> its otherwise inconsistent <UNK> in a strange way also i found the story to be another take on the <UNK> of <UNK> i'd noticed in curse of the golden flower and marie <UNK> both of which i'd seen just prior although <UNK> of course is an entirely different kind of film but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the <UNK> of terrorism controlled poverty in india rather than the <UNK> of <UNK> or the massive <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>  whose self serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an <UNK> of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext
<START> hello can anybody hear me i don't know why you came to this page but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie join the <UNK> this movie was so unbelievably bad i couldn't stop laughing when i saw it i think it's a must see it's bad in a nice way every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here i'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made
<START> i just finished watching this film and wow was that bad actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so <UNK> bad it was kind of entertaining the action of the characters is hilarious from the hyper dramatic way they fall to <UNK> to their incredibly bad acting were the bad guys all just pulled off the street or were they actually actors to incredibly bad delivery of lines to their inexplicable actions if you are going to try and shoot someone through a <UNK> as they enter obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the <UNK> this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines br br the camera work was also really bad you can hardly see what's going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and <UNK> br br i would have voted 1 except that i do like chiba and sidekick sue <UNK> and i was entertained by a couple of scenes 1 breaking of a <UNK> arm so the bone pops out of the skin that's gotta hurt 2 a drug <UNK> eating a brown <UNK> animal a monkey by <UNK> away at the <UNK> with a meat <UNK> 3 sonny <UNK> performing some <UNK> eye surgery on a guy with his fingers br br i am actually a big fan of sonny chiba but this one is really not worth anyone's time i've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching and they are great are the street fighter series and the killing machine i've also heard the <UNK> and <UNK> 13 are good i recommend sticking to those ones
<START> this short was nominated for an academy award and i wish it had won basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians including lester young and joe jones the music is incredible hollywood quite often <UNK> jazz particularly animation believe it or not but this is a rare look on film at an <UNK> jam this has been added to the film <UNK> list and deservedly so tcm runs this as filler <UNK> and runs it every march sometime for its' <UNK> days of oscar tribute from downtown at the <UNK> <UNK> nothing but net and the <UNK> so smooth the net barely moved most <UNK> and highly recommended
<START> good movie very 70s you can not expect much from a film like this <UNK> lane is an actress of erotic films a nice body but nothing exceptional <UNK> to a pornographic actress from the body disappears but the '70s were <UNK> a small breasts and a simple <UNK> not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today the world has changed incredibly the plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary and the brunette actress has a single body has one breast slightly bigger be satisfied <UNK> also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm <UNK> them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them
<START> this is a horrible little film and unfortunately the company that made this short made several others the short is essentially a one joke idea that wasn't funny to begin with and may also offend you it certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children most appeared about 2 years old <UNK> about and pretending to be adults in this case a <UNK> girl and bar room <UNK> it's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they <UNK> to be adults but i can't see anyone wanting to see this especially when a very young shirley temple is dressed in a rather <UNK> outfit and acts like a <UNK> and then other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations at the time i am sure they were not trying to appeal to <UNK> but when looking at it today that is what immediately comes to mind because of this this boring film also <UNK> me out and i hope to never see it again pretty strange and pretty awful
<START> an overblown melodrama typical of its period mid 1950s and appropriate <UNK> food rock hudson the hulk everyone always falls in love with plays his usual stereotype role but whereas in giant made the same year when his material and co stars taylor dean were above average in this movie he is just not good enough to raise the <UNK> beyond a <UNK> tale of how difficult it is to be both rich and happy the self destructive brother and sister robert stack <UNK> his way through the film in a drunken <UNK> and dorothy malone playing a <UNK> poor little rich girl totally over the top end up the losers and hudson gets bacall who is rather wooden in this part which does not have enough character or wit to get her going to <UNK> oscar <UNK> the good end happily and the bad <UNK> that is the meaning of fiction however i was interested to read that the film is based on a true story which <UNK> the plot like other films of the period homosexuality is disguised in <UNK> terms maybe the film could be remade <UNK> character would ring <UNK> if he was hiding homosexual feelings for mitch by marrying todd <UNK> far from heaven greatly improved on all that heaven allows also directed by sirk perhaps <UNK> could remake written on the wind and give us a truly memorable film
<START> this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about <UNK> a living br br some of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie br br some of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that br br watch it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
<START> this movie was bad from the start the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrible the killings were acted out very badly like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and <UNK> her one it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the <UNK> why not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movie sucked
<START> <UNK> might be my favorite ralph bakshi film like the best of his work it's in your face and not ashamed of it for a second but unlike some of his other work even when he's at his finest which was before and after <UNK> with heavy traffic and <UNK> it's not much uneven despite appearances to the contrary bakshi's taking on stereotypes and <UNK> of race of course but moreover he's making what appears to be a <UNK> exploitation film <UNK> almost though bakshi doesn't stop just there if it were just a <UNK> flick with inventive animation it could be enough for a substantial feature but bakshi's aims are higher throwing up these grotesque and exaggerated images of not just black people but italians <UNK> <UNK> jews overall new york types in the urban quarters of manhattan in the 70s he isn't out to make anything realistic the most normal looking creation in looking drawn real is in fact a naked woman painted red white and blue br br in mocking these stereotypes and conventions and horrible forms of racism i e the <UNK> rabbit baby joke yes joke plus black face we're looking at <UNK> to a grand degree and best of all bakshi doesn't take himself too seriously unlike spike lee with a film like <UNK> in delivering his message this is why for the most part <UNK> is a hilarious piece of work where some of the images and things done and sudden twists and of course scenes of awkward behavior i loved the scene where the three animated characters are being talked at by the real life white couple in <UNK> and dress as looking colorful and the like are just too much not to laugh at it's not just the imagery which is in and of itself incredibly over stylized but that the screenplay is sharp and this is key for bakshi this time considering it's got a fairly cohesive narrative to string along the <UNK> and madness br br using at first live action then animation and then an extremely clever matching of the two ironically what bakshi later went for in commercial form with cool world is done here to a t with less money and a <UNK> edge <UNK> and randy are waiting outside a prison wall for a buddy to escape and <UNK> tells of the story of brother rabbit who with brother bear and preacher fox go to harlem and become big time <UNK> with rabbit in direct opposition to a <UNK> the <UNK> esquire godfather character this is obviously a take off on song of the south with its intentionally happy go lucky plot and animation here taken apart and shown for how rotten and offensive it really is br br yet bakshi goes for broke in combining forms animated characters stand behind and move along with live action backgrounds when violence and <UNK> and fights occurs it's as bloody as it can get for 1975 when a dirty cop is at a bar and is drugged and put in black face and a dress he <UNK> in a manner of which not even disney could reach with <UNK> a boxing match with brother bear and an <UNK> as the climax is filmed in wild slow motion archive footage comes on from time to time of old movies some and some from the <UNK> that are just tasteless br br like mel brooks or kubrick or more recently south park bakshi's <UNK> functions as entertainment first and then thought <UNK> second it's also <UNK> film making on an independent scale everything from the long takes to the montage and the endlessly <UNK> designs for the characters however all based on the theme of the piece all serve the thought in the script where its b movie plot opens up much more for interpretation to call it racist misses the point it's like calling dr <UNK> pro atomic <UNK> or <UNK> states of america pro slavery and for me it's one of the best <UNK> ever made
<START> while i don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the <UNK> <UNK> von <UNK> in <UNK> boy is she so convincingly evil here as a witch especially with her age ugly makeup in the beginning and end robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation just about all the actors like claire danes rupert everett ricky <UNK> peter o'toole and many others do fine work here while danes and pfeiffer are classic <UNK> there's also stunning faces of <UNK> miller olivia grant as girl bernard and kate <UNK> especially when we first meet her newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead <UNK> and he looked so much like his father <UNK> as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with <UNK> actually ben barnes many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some <UNK> the main difference was that with <UNK> you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his <UNK> stardust makes you believe for the most part that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout so on that note i highly recommended stardust
<START> it's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that's based on the life of any number of british <UNK> just take a well respected british or australian actor make things look pretty and you're guaranteed a formula for oscar success br br the young victoria is no exception getting just about everything right the cinematography striking and beautiful with soft lights and lush colors and <UNK> starring emily blunt in a role she can finally <UNK> in the film begins with victoria's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to prince albert rupert friend as the young victoria herself <UNK> she's moved like a chess <UNK> by a variety of parties as she finds her <UNK> and her voice as one of <UNK> most influential <UNK> br br while this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory it is the development of victoria's relationship with albert that makes the film slightly more interesting i confess i have a degree in history with a <UNK> in the victorian era so i'm a bit attached to these figures despite their many flaws as <UNK> victoria and albert were some of the first leaders devoted to <UNK> civilization for their people they left their legacy in the arts in public health and education and in victoria's conservative views and mourning culture after <UNK> death but these things are only briefly hinted at during the film br br it is fairly well established that victoria and albert were not only <UNK> in love but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between <UNK> in arranged <UNK> even if it did occur behind the scenes <UNK> was certainly one of the best known blunt and and friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice the proper mix of restraint and desperation it's a different love not usually shown on screen especially in this sort of film it's <UNK> to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field br br but we don't get to see that love enough while the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political <UNK> it doesn't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high also without <UNK> into the more advanced important public work of the pair things feel a bit in <UNK> superficial instead of intimate and sometimes confusing it's not as big an issue during the film but afterward the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched despite the perfect performances by the leads most <UNK> blunt who even captures the famous <UNK> expressions br br for as much as it tries victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain <UNK> that would take it from solid to classic
<START> there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the <UNK> on page one except as jesse says it's the <UNK> all of page one's <UNK> wrote <UNK> as almost so as the dialog is in this movie this just may be one of those <UNK> things we hear so much about but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines a beautiful script maybe robert redford did hold strict <UNK> onto the actors actresses during the filming of this movie so that the beauty of the story would not get lost br br i too attended church when i was very young and into my late teens the <UNK> <UNK> spoke very <UNK> and quietly as the <UNK> <UNK> did in his church that in itself is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern <UNK> <UNK> no holy <UNK> in my church it was a big church with many different programs to keep its <UNK> busy the most inspiring perhaps was the music department with its huge choir and almost classical <UNK> too the sunday evening <UNK> was almost entirely younger people are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night how i wish it still was watching a river runs through it is very much like going to hear a beautiful <UNK> in a church whose members are fully involved in life as has already been so beautifully written the <UNK> for this movie is the open space <UNK> of montana yet aren't there also missile <UNK> there too fly fishing or any other activity which draws family members closer together for a happy life and deep understanding of one another becomes a <UNK> although you see some of the <UNK> aspects of life then too the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart if you let it <UNK> and prostitutes are counter balanced by the simple <UNK> of old fashioned community <UNK> as this movie contains in heavy <UNK> to modern families taking their kids to disney land for <UNK> <UNK> and calling it a day together there is noting wrong with that but as river demonstrates some of its <UNK> beauty could do nothing but make life <UNK> this is the third film i've seen in which tom <UNK> plays a father all different styles and brilliantly acted br br brad pitt mostly an <UNK> talent except for thelma and louise and meet joe black and all of the cast members deserved many awards little stories superbly told will get 10 of 10 from me over any movie with violence foul language <UNK> and action i am thinking particularly of crash and most of <UNK> movies what a <UNK> for peace this movie is
<START> what if a platoon of g i 's from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the <UNK> wars that led to the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> great pitch right the movie does exactly what it says on the tin br br thankfully the writers didn't bother to explain the usually ridiculous in sci fi movies scientific <UNK> <UNK> of time transport no <UNK> or <UNK> they just did however the time transport sequence itself is <UNK> as hell and quite beautiful if not a bit dated not as silly as one would imagine br br the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g i s arrival to medieval japan it picks up with a devastating battle sequence undoubtedly it's the main order of the day the whole concept and by <UNK> the movie itself was probably <UNK> from this simple pitch what if g i 's <UNK> with the latest in modern <UNK> were to fight <UNK> and boy does it deliver br br the main battle sequence that <UNK> more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70's action war movies not only is it relentless and <UNK> in pace and length it's also a terrific <UNK> mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g i samurai can deliver i mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with <UNK> a helicopter and <UNK> in the same shot the g i platoon led by lieutenant <UNK> tears literally through hundreds of extras <UNK> them down with machine guns <UNK> <UNK> and tanks br br this <UNK> mash of styles is with one foot firmly <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> epic of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> samurai <UNK> while the other is in western action and war movies there are <UNK> touches like the wonderful slow motion shots and bloody violence that bring sam <UNK> or <UNK> g <UNK> circa <UNK> to mind japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa and g i samurai effortlessly turns this east meets west melting pot into an exciting film br br the film makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it not that tongue in cheek mentality is completely absent it's just that it doesn't try to <UNK> to so bad it's good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies the budget was probably <UNK> as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for a production that is not a traditional <UNK> <UNK> and special effects the camera work and editing are all top notch almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves br br it's not <UNK> its flaws either of course there are many song scenes where all sorts of 70's japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages there's a bonding scene a love interest scene a war is hell scene etc the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing although it <UNK> at a <UNK> <UNK> minutes it flies like a bullet for the most part still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been <UNK> for a <UNK> effect br br the cast also deserves a mention featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> samurai wolf <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> papers and <UNK> <UNK> all of them hitting the right notes
<START> i admit i've only seen about three of shakespeare's plays romeo juliet <UNK> of course hamlet one i liked the other i found so so <UNK> and hamlet i just found a masterpiece i'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play the acting is extremely strong with a cast that features kenneth branagh robin williams and billy crystal how can you lose and the change in time period looks like somewhere between the 17 and <UNK> plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from if you're into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh
<START> i wonder how the actors acted in this movie <UNK> <UNK> was really herself half in and half out was she <UNK> or being natural it didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film brian cox acted really well i almost thought that he had always acted this way <UNK> <UNK> in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about <UNK> as for gwyneth paltrow the question is what she was doing in this film br br this film is quite sickening and disgusting who would pay to see such a crap
<START> i originally reviewed this film on amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and <UNK> it i believe i called it wretched and a turkey okay well by most standards it's still a turkey it's got almost no production values what little plot there is makes almost no sense and the acting is on the level of a third grade play that said this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic in fact all of director todd <UNK> films have had this effect they're almost like ed wood in that regard watch them over and over and pick out the <UNK> lines continuity errors same zombie two different locations and other flaws br br i'll say this sheets is a very nice guy and while this one of his first productions isn't that great he has gotten better and i must add that the only really decent actor actress in the film is <UNK> <UNK> though i may be biased as i attended school with her
<START> this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked <UNK> and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back as the movie goes along it's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked <UNK> it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in <UNK> this is one of stewart's better westerns
<START> this was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch bob <UNK> host during the half hour before this dave <UNK> only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america's funniest home videos except with a <UNK> who have a combined iq of three <UNK> <UNK> must've really needed the money and <UNK> had to go to the <UNK> bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate <UNK> and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a <UNK> <UNK> must've needed to money to please <UNK> <UNK> while they were dating
<START> br br if you're at all interested in pirates pirate movies new orleans early 19th century american history or <UNK> <UNK> see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it don't be put off by various <UNK> reviews my reaction to it was that it is entertaining well acted for the most part has some very witty dialogue and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm appeal and legendary fascination of the <UNK> jean <UNK> while not all the events in the film are historically accurate can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role <UNK> played in new <UNK> history and the love hate relationship between the respectable citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city's favorite sons don't worry about what the film doesn't do but watch it for what it does do i e for its study of one of new <UNK> and america's most intriguing historical figures
<START> oh dear me rarely has a horror film bored me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an intriguing premise it <UNK> into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual <UNK> the usually excellent alice <UNK> is wasted in this one and the plot twists are ludicrous don't bother unless you're really desperate rating 3 10
<START> i enjoyed this film yet hated it because i wanted to help this guy i am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business who are now still trying to become adults no more fans <UNK> money etc and they are having such a hard time <UNK> to a regular life as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight it is almost like they have to begin <UNK> this film is a testament to what a lot of the old <UNK> from the 70's and 80's are going through now and that's where i find the film sad and depressing but it portrays the life of an old rock star abandoned and lost in a believable way the young girl who arrives at his <UNK> home reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> outrageous and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for this film is a must have for folks in their 50's who have seen the rise and fall of bands people who knew the members and have watched them hurt as age creeps in and popularity fades this is an almost perfect movie sad but in a way positive because of the <UNK> a must see
<START> some nice scenery but the story itself in which a self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anne down visits egypt and in the course of doing <UNK> things in the most un <UNK> of ways e g flash photography in the <UNK> the handling of old <UNK> etc <UNK> a black market <UNK> war and somehow in the span of two days no less becomes that <UNK> <UNK> wearing <UNK> is more puzzling than any <UNK> the <UNK> ever <UNK> down is simply awful as the visiting british <UNK> that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about <UNK> is the fault of the writers certainly but that she's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely and the rest of the cast including sir john gielgud and frank <UNK> seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was in short not what you'd expect from <UNK> planet of the apes <UNK> and co br br worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down <UNK> against all male <UNK> <UNK> them for her failure as an academic while <UNK> under the <UNK> light hollywood could <UNK> to top it off she spends the next hour of the film <UNK> and <UNK> and running into the arms of any dude she can find wow talk about your <UNK> irony br br note to would be <UNK> take a year or two of <UNK> in <UNK> school it'll really help out in the long run
<START> in a very short time the movie showed a boy's odd life of taking pictures showed his life and everyone else's get turned upside down as a result of his photographs then brought everything back to normal in the end one to see if you're looking for something interesting
<START> this is a pleasant film even if the premise is silly it was sort of a guilty pleasure to watch meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film another example is joe vs the <UNK> that's what makes her a star in part walter matthau of course had that ability too and he really puts himself into the role making an amusing good hearted einstein i suppose you could say they're both good at portraying <UNK> characters though <UNK> in different ways <UNK> young women vs <UNK> <UNK>
<START> in 1958 <UNK> was a famous speed trap town much <UNK> was generated by the <UNK> department catching <UNK> the ones who tried to <UNK> the sheriff well that gave the sheriff a chance to push them off the <UNK> <UNK> with his <UNK> <UNK> for example in the beginning of the movie a couple of <UNK> on leave trying to get back to base on time are pushed off to their deaths if i recall correctly then one day a stranger drove into town possibly the coolest hot <UNK> in the world michael <UNK> even his name is a car name as in <UNK> <UNK> in possibly the ultimate hot rod a black <UNK> <UNK> ford <UNK> the colors of death evil and <UNK> he gets picked up for <UNK> by the sheriff on purpose he <UNK> out the lay of the land he is the brother of one of the <UNK> victims he knows how his brother died the <UNK> government is all in favor of the sheriff there's only one way to get justice served for the killing of his brother and to fix things so this ain't a ever gonna happen again to anyone recreate the chase and settle the contest hot <UNK> style to the death he goes out to the <UNK> and practices the sheriff knows <UNK> knows the race begins this is a movie to be remembered by anyone who ever tried to master <UNK> on a certain stretch of road
<START> do not be <UNK> into renting this movie it has nothing to do with an escape from death row despite the english title i can't think of a single good thing to say about the movie poor acting poor editing poor directing laughable plot and the sound music was so irritating it's a wonder this movie doesn't come with a warning label the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it's historical cheesiness quality they just don't make films this bad anymore
<START> i've long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david <UNK> i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time but the talent of <UNK> shines through this <UNK> role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well lit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a <UNK> as well or as they call him a <UNK>
<START> cusack does his best david niven in this one although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed it br br when seen with this in mind its a deliciously over <UNK> <UNK> to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of an under appreciated comedy classic br br <UNK> duff does an over <UNK> britney spears lap dance version of <UNK> bond the writers built a little reverse <UNK> twist into the plot interesting choice br br i never knew how <UNK> <UNK> voice was until this movie i think he has found a new calling doing <UNK> system voice overs
<START> a few months ago i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster hey <UNK> about this film the poster insisted that if i gave <UNK> <UNK> a chance i would like it based partially on that argument i agreed to watch the film br br <UNK> <UNK> has good intentions at least on <UNK> part but lacks the strength to pull it all together its best asset is <UNK> rat boat captain rita played by kate <UNK> who imo should have been the movie's main character instead of <UNK> hugh jackman <UNK> cool tough and interesting while <UNK> spends much of his screen time <UNK> br br one of the things that bothered me most about <UNK> is the <UNK> of jokes that aren't funny to begin with when <UNK> gets hit in the <UNK> the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately my <UNK> <UNK> says one of <UNK> brothers who then <UNK> <UNK> at least three times my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low br br i won't waste time <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> toward pixar one similar film's a coincidence <UNK> a rip off but i will say i'm disappointed in <UNK> they can do and have done so much better try harder next time guys
<START> after a love triangle story in <UNK> <UNK> jo <UNK> <UNK> these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick the film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from <UNK> shah here director duo <UNK> <UNK> did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial <UNK> they are considered as thriller makers of bollywood but in this <UNK> they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama hardly there is a single action scene when <UNK> was being raped by <UNK> colleague in her apartment salman slapped him br br the movie has almost all the standards and ingredients like song story casting performances etc which are required to make a movie hit but of course for <UNK> fan this was something a surprise gift from him why because for so long he has been doing roles where he has a scene to show his open body and dance la la la all around his role as a rich young businessman who has no nonsense nature and of normal attitude is really impressive after all <UNK> a prostitute role performed by <UNK> is amazing later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention her facial expressions and body language become more attractive and focus mainly goes to her her previous role as a pregnant woman in <UNK> <UNK> was not that heart touching as it is here of course this can be <UNK> as improvement then <UNK> a very innocent and helpless wife of raj who only depends on him for a better result she has nothing powerful influence in the story as the main ingredients are in the hands of <UNK> br br finally the main point of the story which is something rare and unique in itself in real world of this age it is not totally impossible to happen such step of searching for a surrogate mother perhaps many are happening in this large world where these are kept secret and in this way the scriptwriter of <UNK> has <UNK> a hidden truth which is taking place in others daily lives but still then it is a doubt
<START> don't get fooled with all the big names like burt reynolds james woods and anne archer they are just <UNK> <UNK> their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like james woods you better make good use of him to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through the plot itself wasn't that bad and the acting from most of the actors was above average cuba gooding jr however was terrible he was so unbelievable that i almost laughed at his dramatic scenes and since this was meant as a serious movie that can't be a good thing the action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting again better direction was needed also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this it took the main character almost half an hour to get in action for an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow the only redeeming factor is angie <UNK> she does her best to make it all work too bad the director left her hanging yes this movie could have been much better with a great director andy <UNK> is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off and for an action stunt <UNK> of his caliber you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes don't waste your time with this one avoid
<START> after seeing this film months ago it keeps jumping back into my consciousness and i feel i must buy it or at least see it again even though i watched it at least 3 times when i rented it at that point br br i fell in love with hal hartley's directing many years ago i found that these films could make me laugh in an place that is rarely entertained it is a strange feeling granted and i assume most people out there really just don't get it or it makes them feel confused and somewhat uncomfortable i guess i just really get it its as if these films were made for me br br although i don't remember if i actually laughed out loud during this film it remains one of the funniest films i've seen in many years if you don't see the humor of the <UNK> bag fay carries from the street to a church to her brother's <UNK> office to her son's <UNK> office you may lack the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film the bag is a silent character in itself being dragged around as an icon of <UNK> the usually <UNK> bitchy parker posey must carry before the international intrigue of the remainder of the film <UNK> her br br i consider henry fool my least favorite of hartley's films i honestly don't remember it very well i think the character himself was so despicable i found it tedious hartley's <UNK> seems to be feminine character development br br aside from <UNK> brilliance it was wonderful to see <UNK> <UNK> one of my favorite actresses again her <UNK> <UNK> is perfect for hartley's direction his ability to make the outrageous seem banal helps define his style as a delicious <UNK> irony throughout br br this film <UNK> into a highly relevant international intrigue story explaining political situations in <UNK> this is never suspected at the beginning the complexity of this film's development is <UNK> br br this is the epitome of a stand alone sequel the less you know about henry fool the more mystery is <UNK> around him the less you expect his appearance toward the end of the film as an alcoholic chain smoking complaint machine <UNK> insults at his <UNK> terrorist caretaker who somehow seems to respect him its like finding out santa claus is actually a 12 year old <UNK> bully br br although i was impressed and satisfied with hartley's other recent films the girl from monday and no such thing fay grim goes far beyond what i expected with a sense of humor and originality no oscar winner would ever dare
<START> this was a weird movie it started out pretty good a solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing br br next comes his down fall here i could tell i was in for a real cheesy b movie poor acting i mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop these guys could not after the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts br br from this point on it is bad acting big boobs the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes br br that said i gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that i just could not quite shake off br br i do not recommend this movie but i have to admit i have seem worse
<START> zodiac killer 1 out of 10 worst acting ever no really worst acting ever david <UNK> last house on the <UNK> no the one from the <UNK> rent it it's really good is the worst of the bunch pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god awful one would be hard pressed to find a home movie <UNK> with such an awkward camera presence the film actually <UNK> to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen br br not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for mr <UNK> to ruin it is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike no post production either come on there has to be some <UNK> a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of <UNK> and aircraft <UNK> <UNK> and this is one visually screwed up picture the <UNK> pictures are <UNK> the way italian cannibal films <UNK> those god awful real life animal killings and the navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement cause we know all the <UNK> <UNK> join the navy what in the world is <UNK> gate is doing releasing this garbage it would embarrass troma the plot is about the zodiac killer last seen in dirty harry  no the one from the <UNK> rent it it's really good somebody gets shot in the stomach in la and the cops assume the zodiac killer is back uh huh what can you expect from a movie that doesn't know that <UNK> iv is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a <UNK> page and <UNK> <UNK> yeah eighties <UNK> and production values meet a <UNK> subplot sign me up
<START> don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives yes it is cheaply made yes the gore is laughable and yes the acting is sub par however this is a <UNK> example of an early slasher flick and if that is your thing its mine then you will enjoy this one there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the <UNK> for one the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies and last but not least the setting is what made the film for me the makers of this film could have done a much better job dressing the set to make it more believable as a college <UNK> however if you can overlook this flaw the setting is great four <UNK> all alone in a huge abandoned condemned building just waiting to be torn down it <UNK> of possibility when watching allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did
<START> i remember seeing this when it was released in a theater in <UNK> <UNK> and not expecting much i mean an australian movie but it finally got to me here's a scene richard chamberlain is sitting cross <UNK> on the floor of a <UNK> apartment in sidney facing an australian <UNK> elder named charlie br br chamberlain you were outside my house last night you frightened my wife who are you and charlie at a deliberate pace replies who are you who are you who are you who are you who are you are you a fish are you a snake are you a man who are you who are you who are you it's a stunning scene shot all in close ups with <UNK> <UNK> handsome face filling the screen in opposition to charlie's black broad <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his <UNK> <UNK> existence into the inexplicable almost <UNK> mysteries of charlie's world br br i don't think i'll go on much about the plot it's kind of an apocalyptic tale but i must say whoever did the research on australian <UNK> belief systems should get an a plus they've got everything in here from pointing the bone to the dream time a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real it's an extremely spooky movie without any musical <UNK> or <UNK> special effects <UNK> world simply begins to <UNK> into <UNK> dreams for reasons never made entirely clear br br if there's a problem with the script that's it nothing is ever made entirely clear does chamberlain who seems to have some extraordinary <UNK> with the <UNK> die in the last wave do the <UNK> does the entirety of sidney the basic premise is a little hard to accept too though granted that this is a fantasy the <UNK> are invested with the kind of spiritual power that americans <UNK> on american indians whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying more elegant and beautiful if you like mythology is still an attempt to <UNK> an ordinary demanding and sometimes disappointing physical existence the <UNK> of charlie is more convincing that the <UNK> of <UNK> in cecil b <UNK> the ten <UNK> but they're brothers under the skin br br but i don't care about that taken as a film this one is pretty good and it's especially important for <UNK> the celebrity of the director peter <UNK> and the australian film industry this was the first of a great wave of films from the <UNK> some of them <UNK> like mad max and some subtle and dramatic like <UNK> i like <UNK> stuff which resembles nicholas <UNK> in being pregnant with <UNK> dread try <UNK> at hanging rock for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood
<START> who votes in these ratings <UNK> is a beautifully acted brilliantly observed piece of work with actors on top of their game especially ed harris and the <UNK> robert deniro please don't mention marlon brando in the same breath of this man see taxi driver for <UNK> of this point is it a <UNK> movie because it doesn't have sex meaningless action nudity in it this movie is about the <UNK> of the characters involved ed harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional <UNK> towards the end is heartbreaking the part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young <UNK> sporting military <UNK> while we are on this subject casino 7 8 out of 10 one of the greatest films of all time from one of the greatest directors starring the greatest movie actor of all time with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever only <UNK> just above average come on
<START> i still have grainy late night no cable cheap vhs <UNK> of this show from <UNK> back when late night commercials and all when i would stay up to whatever weird hour they would slap this show on just so i could tape it br br the series wasn't really about freddy <UNK> only the first couple of episodes actually involved him as anything but a rod <UNK> esquire <UNK> instead each episode was a distinct nightmare using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood dating <UNK> dating money death dating and hmm dating br br from the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says i will love you forever to the wrong girl and is stuck with her literally at least for a moment they grow together to the one where a young <UNK> goes home with a strange man only to find herself in his cabin where he has a <UNK> room full of other <UNK> and one i only vaguely remember which compared blind dates to hockey and the <UNK> and <UNK> that go with it dating was definitely the scariest thing in the series br br one episode had jeffrey combs re animator etc as a motivated pizza <UNK> with a tasty new secret <UNK> not original but still creepy and fun br br even so some of the episodes were great my personal favorite was it's a miserable life where a young man is trapped working in his parents' <UNK> joint when he wants to go off to college stuck talking to himself and doing little puppet shows with old <UNK> until one late night when a weird guy comes through the drive through and suddenly his life is not the same no not freddy just a thug with a gun turns out the whole mind blowing episode is just that the last thoughts that pass through the kid's head along with a bullet br br the second half of the same episode many of the <UNK> nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely connected short stories followed his girlfriend who was also wounded but not killed in the drive by and who is taken to the hospital from heck they <UNK> in all the most creepy hospital nightmare clichés and then some from accidentally having your mouth <UNK> shut or waking up during an operation to having your dead boyfriend try and lure you into the <UNK> for a little <UNK> br br again that was my favorite br br some of the episodes were much dumber like almost all of the ones they've made available on video they put the crummy ones out as representative of the series and then nobody likes them thinks the show <UNK> and then they don't put any more on video it's a miserable life is only available on pal dvd in england but i'm still gonna buy it
<START> finally i've been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere in <UNK> i met a few of the actors who were really nice and who were great in the movie i watched the trailer so many times that i didn't know what to expect but got totally sucked in the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too i recommend it to anyone who's a ryan <UNK> fan and <UNK> <UNK> was good in it too the other actors were good also great i hope it comes out on dvd soon br br i first got into ryan from watching the <UNK> and then saw him in a bunch of good <UNK> like imaginary heroes he is great in this film and everything that he does that's indie i also like <UNK> but haven't seen her in as much hope to see them both in more soon
<START> my favorite memory of this show and the band was when i got together with a bunch of my friends which are <UNK> <UNK> and had a big <UNK> and we took a cd of their songs and the dvd of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and <UNK> a happy <UNK> around the burning stuff while singing <UNK> <UNK> the witch is dead that was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a <UNK> god this show sucks i hate it so much get rid of the crappy car you guys really suck you really ruined the whole channel no <UNK> or anything but you guys need to get a life i mean really who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can't even sing you guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as <UNK> or something except <UNK> she's really pretty but still you guys <UNK>
<START> i can't tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in <UNK> <UNK> i say that these reviewers have no imagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing <UNK> dragons this movie is for you especially if you got into the oriental adventures i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen just more <UNK> to get my own big screen t v
<START> partially from the perceived need one feels to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more <UNK> to a 1950's movie going public br br the film starts with some <UNK> funny characterizations of the upper class <UNK> running the foreign office the british are <UNK> in the way that only the british can <UNK> themselves but after that the film loses its way in a conventional <UNK> plot terry thomas watchable as always but the great talent in the cast peter sellers et al is largely wasted br br a <UNK> but not great film
<START> i didn't feel as if i'd been raped like i did with the enchanted christmas but <UNK> magical world is still the <UNK> of beauty and the beast like christmas <UNK> hates its audience although not to such an extreme degree it's ugly <UNK> idiotic and the writing is <UNK> bad none of the stories work these are not the characters we loved from <UNK> at all they're a bunch of <UNK> people i wanted to <UNK> it but after a few minutes i gave up because no one in their right mind would take this <UNK> seriously what we have here are three stories the perfect word is an overbearing <UNK> study of forgiveness <UNK> <UNK> only works if you can accept that <UNK> name is actually <UNK> and that she's a closet james bond <UNK> and that <UNK> is an idiot concerning women broken wing or broken wind as i like to call it is probably the most <UNK> of the bunch beast hates birds since when don't watch this crap every copy of this video deserves to be <UNK> beauty and the beast is still a cinematic classic a <UNK> celebration of love art intelligence and the human soul
<START> from around the time europe began fighting world war ii until the <UNK> end hollywood with significant <UNK> from the government made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to <UNK> in the army by making the life of a <UNK> appear cool this is by far the <UNK> <UNK> that the life of a soldier is devoid of work you get the best food and you get to lie around all day listening to ann miller on the radio i am far too young to have <UNK> in wwii but i think that there was more to it than that there is the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of a plot and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day's leading acts br br i think that by 1943 even the most naive of <UNK> knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky <UNK> portrayed in this movie while i am sure that it was meant to be viewed as <UNK> entertainment i can't help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war were amused or <UNK> by this <UNK> of their loved <UNK> sacrifice
<START> saving grace is surely one of the leading <UNK> for the <UNK> to ruin an adequate film in the final few <UNK> award naturally if you mix a quaint <UNK> village largely populated by retired <UNK> ladies with a liberal dose of marijuana a certain amount of silliness will ensue however the last seven minutes of the film <UNK> into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny it is a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as <UNK> waking ned <UNK> which also portrayed a <UNK> small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to <UNK> themselves from a <UNK> situation br br the protagonist of saving grace is middle aged recently widowed grace <UNK> whose husband's legacy of bad <UNK> has forced her into an unconventional way of <UNK> money helped by her <UNK> matthew she turns her <UNK> expertise to the <UNK> <UNK> of marijuana unfortunately this leads her into confrontation with the local police her husband's <UNK> and a french drug baron whom all turn up at her <UNK> simultaneously the relationship and <UNK> between grace and matthew is well portrayed and brenda <UNK> gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character you can really feel what she is going through br br the casting of the minor roles is excellent even if some of them are rather <UNK> eccentric however the transformation of jacques the drug lord into <UNK> romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all and surely <UNK> is not such a revolution in the world of <UNK> growing sadly the film <UNK> gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants
<START> this is film making at it's <UNK> and it's best br br i had my doubts because even though freeman is great actor sometimes he gets involved in bad projects this is not one of those times br br it's a small story that runs just over an hour and fifteen in a time when we are getting used to having movies become longer and longer and not necessarily better the director uses the short time to his advantage because the characters are so well defined from the start great portrayals by freeman and vega by the way that the little bit of background info on them seems real morgan is himself even though his name is not mentioned he has been out of movies for a couple of years now because he was <UNK> by the business and developed a fear to commit to a script and is doing research for a character in a indie movie where he plays a store supermarket manager the story begins by him being drop of in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets the <UNK> of the 10 items or less vega and has to take a ride with her cause the production forgot to pick him up br br in many ways it's a road movie morgan provides the laughs and quirks with his <UNK> smile and positive perspective on everything showing off an accomplished actor who has trained his mind to be able to define everyone he sees into a character he could play and paz by the way what an extraordinary beautiful woman even more gorgeous than penelope <UNK> brings the vulnerability of a 25 years old separated woman who works harder than everyone else without getting any credit in a dead end job at a crappy supermarket br br it's a <UNK> there is a lot of dialog but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well <UNK> the characters become so lovable right away that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more screen time of this odd couple but the <UNK> is in the nature of the story so it was a good call from the director not to give in
<START> after his classic film noir homage <UNK> roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which like <UNK> and rosemary's baby deals with the paranoia and <UNK> generated by apartment living br br claustrophobic <UNK> are the ones which polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most <UNK> and confined picture he ever created the emphasis on side walls and distant <UNK> points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely <UNK> but the tenant is not just confined <UNK> but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist <UNK> played by polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes <UNK> point of view and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror br br i can't think of any film that is more about the <UNK> and <UNK> of one character some psychological thrillers like m or <UNK> tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist others like psycho attempt in depth scientific analysis of his mental condition the tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply <UNK> us completely inside <UNK> experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational br br polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences why precisely because they unfold so slowly and <UNK> so much time in <UNK> setting up situations that they <UNK> the viewer in paranoia a much later polanski horror the <UNK> gate is a bit of a mess plot wise but at least it still manages to achieve that <UNK> sense of dread br br this is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek <UNK> another standout performance is that of the all too often overlooked shelley winters as the <UNK> in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange gothic european movie also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are <UNK> dubbed in the english language version br br the tenant is more polished and less pretentious than <UNK> but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemary's baby so engrossing and entertaining the tenant is good with no major flaws and polanski was really on top form as a director but it's not among his most gripping works
<START> written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by some exploitation <UNK> this is dull and hard to watch br br not the worst movie ever but at least schlock like plan 9 from outer space usually had a real actor or two i'd recommend a thief in the night only to hardcore <UNK> and hardcore <UNK> i'm neither br br don't believe me watch it for free albeit <UNK> from poor vhs here http www archive <UNK> details thief in the night br br relevant <UNK> added mostly to reach <UNK> 10 line minimum http en <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> http www <UNK> com reviews <UNK> thief in the night se a

<START> eric <UNK> is obviously a talented film maker and so are the two guys who wrote the script therefore <UNK> is a great flick made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination well i'm a bit <UNK> but nevertheless i'm sincere so if you like dark gory movies go and see this one it's really worth it
<START> the beginning of the 90s brought many quirky and off beat independent films a particular sub genre of which is the semi spiritual desert crime movie others of note are wild at heart from <UNK> <UNK> dawn and to a certain extent natural born killers good films like those <UNK> junk like highway <UNK> destiny turns on the radio and this <UNK> surreal anti masterpiece under the <UNK> moon it's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone <UNK> it but keeps going to the point of <UNK> while the pursuit across the spirit world of the desert and the casting of chris penn are good ideas the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie and isn't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy i won't blow the ending but let's just say it's bad the film is basically a bad side effect of genre cancer this is the <UNK> of indie <UNK>
<START> in 1972 after his wife left to go her own way elvis <UNK> began dating linda thompson miss thompson a good <UNK> long haired lovely <UNK> beauty queen is <UNK> to fill a void in <UNK> life when <UNK> divorce became final linda was already in place as the legendary <UNK> live in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976 br br this is a <UNK> look at their love affair and <UNK> linda whole <UNK> <UNK> to her <UNK> needs and desires and even putting up with his <UNK> <UNK> by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with <UNK> at times this movie is harsh and dark of heart a very unattractive look at the <UNK> and his queen br br don johnson is absolutely awful as elvis over acting to the <UNK> is not attractive stephanie <UNK> lacks the <UNK> of linda but does the job pretty well supporting cast includes john crawford <UNK> lee and rick <UNK> watching this twice is more than enough for me but don't let this review stop you from checking it out for most elvis fans that i have <UNK> with this is not a <UNK> presentation
<START> i was speechless and <UNK> after my first viewing of this many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the <UNK> <UNK> i kept focusing on how these women who are <UNK> way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways and i wonder whether their <UNK> from the world was <UNK> by something beyond the <UNK> of life in the unreal blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of <UNK> and rebellion that <UNK> out of their control and took on a life of its' own this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the <UNK> do their thing i kept noting things like the empty <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> bedroom cats <UNK> on the bed <UNK> <UNK> from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong very definitely worth seeing and seeking out you'll never forget it but very disturbing
<START> please future writers producers directors learn from this movie br br never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen bold because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided a step to something new creative and daring just when you think <UNK> i've seen this <UNK> or 'i am sure this is what will happen <UNK> stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story br br the actors are great even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he's in michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving <UNK> <UNK> other big names make outstanding roles i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie but once again the story by neil <UNK> all the little things he <UNK> for this universe simply outstanding br br i watched this movie at a pre screening today a day before the official release and do hope it will have huge success there is so much humor but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes the look in the eyes of <UNK> the <UNK> of captain shakespeare the passion of <UNK> the witch impressive unforgettable br br for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 watch it and enjoy it br br 11 10 outstanding br br peace and love
<START> melvyn douglas and joan blondell co star in the amazing mr williams a 1939 mystery comedy that's quite good although forgotten probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 br br douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly <UNK> what happens in this film is no exception he's called to a murder scene just as he's about to walk down the <UNK> yet again br br both stars were excellent at comedy worked together well and often and help make this battle of the <UNK> fun edward <UNK> and donald <UNK> are on hand for excellent support br br as you can read in other reviews melvyn douglas doesn't make much of a woman br br entertaining if a little on the long side br br one of the comments here <UNK> melvyn douglas one of our greatest actors he literally <UNK> effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man he wasn't lazy but rather a very hard working actor who made it look easy who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career he just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in <UNK> and i never sang for my father and call him lazy or make reference to his <UNK>
<START> yes i'll say before i start commenting this movie is incredibly underrated br br sharon stone is great in her role of catherine <UNK> as is <UNK> as dr glass he is an <UNK> sent in to <UNK> her after the death of a sports star glass is drawn into a seductive game that <UNK> uses to manipulate his mind br br the acting was good apart from <UNK> br br stone really has a talent with this role she's slick naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino <UNK> was also good he showed much <UNK> in a role that needed it <UNK> however was lame he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way he really sucked br br overall this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch just ignore <UNK>
<START> this is an awesome action film with great one liners from arnie it's <UNK> made with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied the characters were awesome and richard dawson is very menacing as the main villain yes it has tons of plot holes however it's highly highly entertaining with a great ending as well it had a great story too it and arnie and maria <UNK> <UNK> had great chemistry together the character development was also pretty good with some superb performances the directing is great paul michael <UNK> does a very good job here with awesome use of colors keeping it stylish throughout awesome camera angles and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace good job there is a little bit of gore we get a few bloody <UNK> wounds exploding head <UNK> throat bloody chainsaw <UNK> <UNK> corpses blood and an <UNK> the acting is great arnold <UNK> is amazing as always he is excellent in the acting department has tons of hilarious one liners kicks that ass and as always is a big physical presence and was tons of fun to watch arnie rules maria <UNK> <UNK> does well here she was really cute and had good chemistry with arnie <UNK> <UNK> is decent here with what he has to do which is not much marvin j <UNK> is good as the geeky type guy he was cool richard dawson is awesome as the main villain and was very very menacing and he was fun to watch jesse <UNK> jim brown <UNK> van <UNK> gus <UNK> and professor <UNK> <UNK> all do what they have to do very well as the <UNK> overall a must see 1 2 out of 5
<START> walt disney's the rookie is based on the story of jim morris a former minor league <UNK> who made one of the most amazing <UNK> in sports history ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his major league debut in 1999 at the age of 35 br br the film opens with a brief synopsis of <UNK> childhood which included a series of re locations his father was a military man and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas <UNK> passion for baseball remained strong br br the childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult morris played by dennis quaid who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake texas it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn't work out br br <UNK> team is struggling and he <UNK> them about giving up on their dreams they turn the table on him telling him that he should try out for a major league team at several times when he <UNK> to them in practice they express <UNK> at the speed with which he throws morris seems <UNK> but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district he will try out for a major league team br br big lake does win district and <UNK> to his end of the deal morris <UNK> a <UNK> bay devil <UNK> try out <UNK> he throws 98 miles an hour faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league <UNK> after another try out with the team morris is offered a contract with the devil <UNK> br br this leaves him with a tough decision stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league <UNK> of making little money and spending months at a time away from home and the decision is even more <UNK> than during his first minor league <UNK> because he now has a wife and three children br br morris signs with the devil <UNK> begins at the <UNK> level and moves up quickly to the <UNK> level one level below major league baseball but as the season winds down the chances of him getting called up grow increasingly slim br br for the most part i love this movie there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it's easy to find yourself really pulling for morris also the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels and most of all it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve br br still the movie has some flaws while generally accurate it <UNK> and even <UNK> a few things check out http <UNK> go com <UNK> s closer <UNK> <UNK> for some examples also except for one scene in which he <UNK> with his players the movie completely ignores <UNK> christian faith but considering disney's left wing <UNK> that's not surprising br br presumably a lot of the <UNK> <UNK> were done to make the story more dramatic yet the 20 minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is <UNK> from the movie br br for example from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was 12 morris re located 14 times and his initial minor league career ended after four <UNK> through which he lost half of the muscle in his left <UNK> shoulder thus making his throwing 98 <UNK> even more inexplicable br br to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris it's good to not only watch the rookie but to watch the dvd's documentary check out the aforementioned link to the movie's inaccuracies and probably also to read <UNK> biography also titled the rookie i haven't read the book but i hope to one of these days br br but overall the rookie is a very good portrayal of a <UNK> story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man 8 10
<START> i watched the movie and was <UNK> to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience the language would put to shame the street <UNK> br br the plot a father forcing none of his son to marry seems far fetched br br the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble <UNK> attention br br and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look br br hope it saves your time
<START> this film is so bad you can't imagine the acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas an it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in switzerland the interactions between the soldiers didn't make any sense at all the story could have been taken out from a bravo photo story the dialogues were as wooden as <UNK> and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy but nowadays it doesn't need much to satisfy the audience the actors were handsome for example the former miss switzerland and the main character was even hung <UNK> and there certainly was much abuse of drugs that's real cool man particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens but the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the <UNK> group dynamics by telling <UNK> that you are a nerd if you don't go along with the other <UNK> and say yes that is exactly what it was like when i was in the army that's exactly what i'm going to do when i must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and <UNK> and don't think i like the army i was there and i hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the <UNK> toilet with a teeth brush which i was forced to do because i offended an lieutenant it is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and i think its not a bad thing but this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and <UNK> idiots but since i now that my opinion isn't very popular i will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits br br 2 10 br br sorry for my bad english
<START> movie about a small town with equal numbers of <UNK> and <UNK> new family moves in cue the <UNK> dialog mediocre acting green <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and every other <UNK> mormon <UNK> known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time <UNK> this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there you'll be much better off watching <UNK> other movies <UNK> dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared <UNK> has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and <UNK> dynamite i would recommend both movies over this <UNK>
<START> my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film in fact they're quite <UNK> with mine what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story motive or dialogue maybe someone should tell <UNK> that <UNK> lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a <UNK> audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of <UNK> young the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar slips a <UNK> to an unsuspecting hero who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine who is unaware of what's taken place somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of sorry <UNK> stick with music and leave film making to steven stills
<START> director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces like network dog day afternoon or <UNK> but he was not having too much luck on his most recent works gloria 1999 was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment now lumet brings his best film in decades and by my point of view a true masterpiece before the devil knows you're dead i think this film is like a <UNK> for lumet this movie has an excellent story which deeply has many layers also i think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant philip seymour hoffman brings as usual a magnificent performance and he's no doubt one of the best actors of our days ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view his performance in here is great the rest of the cast is also excellent specially the great albert finney but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars the film has a good level of intensity in part thanks to the performances and in part thanks to the brilliant screenplay before the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction a great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movies like this
<START> <UNK> ho was a good idea however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition in this movie the main character hunt stevenson michael keaton goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying <UNK> town two things come at you first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so and so well at that secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top <UNK> aside from germany and put a plant there as unrealistic keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not <UNK> <UNK> ho has a happy days and <UNK> and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can <UNK> americans his no 2 man <UNK> who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so i would have <UNK> all the japanese characters been like <UNK> than the soft <UNK> characters they made the japanese out to be it would have made the film more interesting
<START> i don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail <UNK> stallone is once again john rambo author and survivor of a season in hell <UNK> from prison by his only friend major richard crenna to secretly return to vietnam take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy br br fat chance what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in take <UNK> and sneak out who would come to see the movie br br it's essentially a celebration of <UNK> <UNK> preparing for his mission we see his well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they are <UNK> and <UNK> throughout there is the ritual <UNK> on of black leather ugly guns and even <UNK> knives the black guns are <UNK> assembled with loud <UNK> and almost as <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the bow is tested and yes it has enough <UNK> to drive a <UNK> through an <UNK> <UNK> the knife is <UNK> with slick <UNK> br br stallone and one of his <UNK> are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in <UNK> school no guts you know just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer br br the movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is <UNK> it deliberately <UNK> in on the myth popular in the mid 1980s that there were <UNK> numbers of <UNK> quietly kept in wretched camps by the north <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> free our <UNK> why would they keep them it was never quite <UNK> out but perhaps to turn the <UNK> into a slave labor force in a country that has absolutely no <UNK> other than labor or maybe for their propaganda value as an <UNK> to <UNK> the united states a propaganda weapon that the <UNK> kept secret from the world br br as a captive rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north <UNK> <UNK> to his neck in pig <UNK> and then <UNK> out of it by his <UNK> his <UNK> still on display then not content with <UNK> <UNK> a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the <UNK> officer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of making you remember a high tech type the russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dump br br rambo returns and declares that he <UNK> to drift <UNK> until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly <UNK> upon and cursed which is why i guess we elected so many to the <UNK> and <UNK> others to high <UNK> positions the last three losing presidential candidates were among that <UNK> group at least <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> left room open for a sequel which arrived <UNK> br br the action movies with <UNK> and willis and others were <UNK> by <UNK> but rambo is <UNK> it <UNK> <UNK> through it's <UNK> <UNK> swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak to speak is a sign of weakness
<START> swing is an important film because it's one of the remaining black produced and acted films from the 1930s many of these films have simply <UNK> so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape it's also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the <UNK> of the old <UNK> club a time all but forgotten today br br unfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances it's also a mess the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era including a <UNK> donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day however the writing is just god awful and a bit trashy at times and projects images of black america that some might find a bit <UNK> this is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a no account bum who lives off his hard working wife a popular stereotype of the time and when he is caught with a <UNK> who by the way totally <UNK> this role they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe <UNK> and the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor a trashy scene indeed later in the film when the <UNK> donna is behaving <UNK> her husband punches her in the face and everyone <UNK> him it seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common <UNK> in the audience plus they can't even do this well with some of the worst acting i've seen in a very long time br br still if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way with trashy characters bad acting and direction and poor writing this one might be worth a <UNK> so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture just don't say i didn't warn you about the acting it's really really bad
<START> i two came home from school fast as i could to catch <UNK> and stuff on t v that was the most fun time in my life is to watch <UNK> and stuff on t v growing up still love it today i am <UNK> years old this year
<START> extremely tense thriller set in the urban chaos of <UNK> <UNK> the biggest and <UNK> third world nightmare in brazilian <UNK> for the sake of making it easy for anyone who is curious about this intriguing and truly well made film it has the <UNK> of mexican feature <UNK> <UNK> with a character not too far off max <UNK> from both cape fears although this is not by any means a film about a psychopath two partners alexandre <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in a construction company pay <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to off their third partner and majority share <UNK> in said construction outfit the murder is blamed on the city but things begin to look very grim indeed when witty and charismatic walking nightmare <UNK> decides he wants to be around the ever so nervous partners in crime not only <UNK> but more importantly <UNK> the strict social <UNK> that make up brazilian society <UNK> turns poverty into an attitude and he wants in the look is almost entirely <UNK> grainy the performances outstanding throughout especially so as first time actor and member of classic brazilian pop band <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the viewer with his pretty funny social terror br br i saw the film at the <UNK> film fest in november 2001 it has since done very well in sundance and berlin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> when you see this movie you begin to realise what a drastically under <UNK> asset the late dudley moore was there should be a dozen movies like this in our archive br br he was already top notch talent before he went to hollywood both as a comedian and a musician but mostly he is remembered for his pairing with peter cook on television and in one or two indifferent british movies perhaps the best of these was <UNK> br br he always tended to be <UNK> by cook who's jealousy and <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> and <UNK> moore to realise his true potential in america <UNK> is the result br br this is a truly splendid movie moore's <UNK> comedy as a <UNK> is <UNK> the script is perfectly suited to his manner with <UNK> of hilarious almost surreal <UNK> <UNK> there is something so british about him that i'm actually surprised he found such an appeal to american tastes tommy cooper an <UNK> comedian after the same fashion tended to draw a blank it is moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so endearing br br <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> tend to play straight roles against him but still have some excellent one liners john <UNK> in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and <UNK> authority that is a treasure to watch he <UNK> steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his oscar correct me if i'm wrong but he has never played any other comic role br br there is a follow up movie called <UNK> 2 on the <UNK> it never <UNK> the same sublime levels of fun that this one reaches but it is still rather good even so <UNK> only gets a cameo appearance at the beginning and as a ghost it is darker and there is some interesting soul searching it will disappoint if you watch <UNK> first br br hollywood seemed to loose interest in <UNK> dudley after these two <UNK> he eventually returned to britain <UNK> and apparently dying br br but <UNK> is a <UNK> of what might have been we can only imagine the other great movies he should have made br br <UNK> sadly missed dudley
<START> i wonder what audiences of the day thought when first laying eyes on walter jack palance <UNK> certainly he looks like no one else of the time that skull like face <UNK> nose and <UNK> body even now he remains an unsettling presence and what could be more appropriate than his <UNK> out of those <UNK> new orleans <UNK> that appear to <UNK> like the plague <UNK> is <UNK> on the city i'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes br br the movie itself is very <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> black humor the widmark douglas interplay the un <UNK> locations the battles among <UNK> are woven into a <UNK> realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time even <UNK> domestic scenes that put a woman <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> manage not to be too <UNK> director kazan certainly shows his <UNK> for <UNK> a studio fox product no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect br br widmark does a solid low key job as the public health officer but my money is on the one and only zero mostel was there ever a <UNK> performer who could <UNK> <UNK> or get pushed around more than the <UNK> fall guy e g the <UNK> 1950 that scene with mostel where palance <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> wife <UNK> is a gem of frantic <UNK> as mostel tries to <UNK> each like some <UNK> <UNK> too bad he lost so many years to the <UNK> i wonder if it was the <UNK> kazan who named him br br but it's not only the professionals that add color the locals add both character and authenticity especially the two asian guys interviewed by the cops that whole scene has an improvised air as if kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot then too that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration and what about those flea bitten coffee <UNK> that have me running to the nearest <UNK> br br anyway the movie is still a well staged riveting thriller with an apocalyptic air that oddly <UNK> many of today's mega hits
<START> actually the answer only <UNK> a tiny portion of this excellent <UNK> movie that <UNK> us on our delicate <UNK> c g and special cameras <UNK> by <UNK> incredibly display the inner and outer <UNK> of an average human be it adult men and women boys and girls or babies nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed <UNK> <UNK> featuring a marvin <UNK> hit the heart etc some especially revealing moments include how an <UNK> can be immersed underwater and also how the <UNK> <UNK> look it is amazing how we function br br the subject matter <UNK> around an awful lot but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be required to know
<START> i <UNK> finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago wow i still cant believe what i've watched br br this is absolutely the worst movie ever if i would list all the flaws in the movie this review would take me a lot of sentences very funny flaws because of being that bad though br br you got to be amazed with the skill of the <UNK> assigned to rescue the plane they didn't even know how to move br br ice t is so bad actor and the thing i don't understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero but he's a zero br br of course the major flaws will be the landing of an <UNK> needing only 3 or 4 <UNK> from a guy in <UNK> to land the plane amazing as well as the dead <UNK> that had almost no blood at all br br but i strongly recommend of watching this movie as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
<START> i have never seen a worse movie br br it is possible to take a <UNK> up video game and make it into a decent movie br br mistake 1 absolutely no connection to any of the characters in this movie you don't bond with any of the characters because you don't get a chance br br the only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand <UNK> as played by clint howard except for this unique character the outcome of the movie is meaningless as all the characters were lifeless from the <UNK> br br mistake 2 the worst <UNK> scene ever i love <UNK> i love when the <UNK> open up on the <UNK> and clean house heck i even like to watch a <UNK> clean house sometimes but this <UNK> was weird i guess that the best way to describe it is <UNK> i've seen people shoot with more feeling and emotion while playing the <UNK> in this movie it looked and felt like the actors were simply walking through shooting everything that moved without emotion br br why where's the trash talking where's the <UNK> of rage amongst the <UNK> these are supposed to be kids that got caught at a rave gone bad but even real soldiers acting <UNK> and <UNK> show their humanity br br if you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters i <UNK> sam <UNK> evil dead series do not see the disaster that is house of the dead i hope that they burn the master and all copies of this movie
<START> normally i don't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes but the characters and the originality of the film's premise made it much easier to watch david duchovny <UNK> his normal acting approach which was great to see angelina jolie of course was beautiful and did great acting great cast all together a must see for people bored with the same old action movie
<START> jennifer <UNK> gina <UNK> from dead and breakfast returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister <UNK> to her grandmother fay <UNK> who's still living in it jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to <UNK> <UNK> she also begins to have <UNK> recurring nightmares of a mysterious <UNK> there was really no one to relate to in this film jennifer seemed cold distant <UNK> and <UNK> whereas the grandmother seemed <UNK> sad and also <UNK> the film is good and well made but with no one to empathize with i found it hard to care about what happened to them br br my grade c
<START> this could have been a very good film if i had been able to watch it the hand held camera was very <UNK> from the opening credits i was worried several of us watching it felt very <UNK> by the end but we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film giving some insight to the young pop culture in south africa the black and white film did enhance the <UNK> feeling of it the acting seemed very authentic some of the dialog was a little hard to understand but a theater full of non south <UNK> seemed to find most of it funny if you get motion sickness at all though you may seriously consider skipping this film it's quaint but not worth the <UNK>
<START> we're talking about a low budget film and it's understandable that there are some weaknesses no spoilers one sudden <UNK> expert and one meaningless alcoholic but in general the story keeps you interested most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations br br i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot i applaud this one on that br br if you know what i mean try to see also <UNK> <UNK> nine queens a film from <UNK>
<START> i don't know why i'm taking the time to review this waste of time movie if you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion  good bad or surprising  don't it finally <UNK> out after stiff formulaic predictable dialogue and acting <UNK> scenes are so <UNK> lit you think if the camera were <UNK> out one <UNK> further you'd see the <UNK> lights costumes hair <UNK> and sets are <UNK> pressed and <UNK> are we supposed to imagine common people really lived like that in early 20th century arizona other <UNK> comparisons to sam <UNK> are an insult to <UNK> at least that director <UNK> his violence into the context of chaos and mayhem hard men's gore is gratuitous exploding <UNK> from wooden <UNK> of bad guys with <UNK> <UNK> huh i can believe heston thought he might have been making something of worth with this film he does get to <UNK> his gun in his cold fingers but coburn i'll never guess why he signed up for this travesty want to see a movie about the end of the west as we knew it the end of westerns as we knew them watch the <UNK> or <UNK> again the last hard men is a mockery of an <UNK> to the western
<START> me neither but this flick is unfortunately one of those movies that are too bad to be good and too good to be awful which makes it utterly pointless and a total waste of time there's nothing more uninteresting than a mediocre movie and my name is modesty whatever the <UNK> is takes mediocrity to a new level it's full of b actors but isn't any fun whatsoever because it takes itself seriously it sets itself up as a thriller but then turns into some kind of growing up drama flashback style the beautiful alexandra <UNK> <UNK> beyond recognition under makeup more resembles a cast member from top model than modesty blaise i'm not one of those die hard comic book freaks who wants every adaptation of his precious graphic novels to be pitch perfect in fact i've never even read modesty blaise all i wanted was a decent movie to watch but this wasn't it the film feels half finished with a weak and very <UNK> conclusion to a rather weak plot it also takes its audience for idiots explaining every tiny detail of the plot to us and showing flashbacks of things that happened three scenes ago i guess they think we all have <UNK> br br now i love a good b movie what's better than just turning your brain off and <UNK> the cinematic equivalent of a <UNK> and modesty is directed by none other than scott <UNK> who brought us the wonderful splatter crap flick from <UNK> till dawn 2 texas blood money i loved from <UNK> till dawn 2 because it brought everything a bad b movie should bring to the table nudity gore guns you name it modesty is just dull the flashback concerning <UNK> life isn't interesting the acting isn't bad enough to be laughed at in fact i kinda liked <UNK> coaster <UNK> hey buddy <UNK> are your friends performance as the baddie br br so overall it's just lame weak uninspired call it what you will don't watch anything because tarantino presents it people this is just a very forgettable half hearted thriller and it never tries to be more than that allow me to round off this review with a very lame pun seriously even i'm cringing my name is modesty a modesty waste of time 4 10
<START> it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with <UNK> actors the good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br this movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum <UNK> of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br if you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn't recommend this movie
<START> a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it up br br i'll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience br br the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that <UNK> these people although it can be <UNK> that that seeming failing in <UNK> serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice <UNK> who plays mary brady the <UNK> mother br br king manages to take a simple story of <UNK> or people who are a little different okay a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan
<START> one of my favorite twilight zone episodes and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood <UNK> and la <UNK> my father and i and guess who was coming toward us in the <UNK> barney phillips but no hat on at least i don't think he had a hat on br br we asked him about his third eye and he said something like he left it at home and everybody he met that day had asked him about it br br a friendly guy we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those days br br btw i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the three hands on the other alien br br <UNK> <UNK> o'neill br br hollywood native and resident <UNK> to 1963
<START> this film pulls you in from the get go because it grabs our attention by <UNK> yeah that this story is opening with a cliché  a funeral br br in hands other than <UNK> i wouldn't have given it an 8 as this material has been done over and over again the great reunion of a once famous pick one please team army platoon theatre group singers band br br but this movie never <UNK> to cheap <UNK> and when you think it is going to it <UNK> off in another direction a case in point is the flowers that are sent by an admirer to <UNK> br br the band members are an interesting group and ride above the clichés too one is in jail one has found religion one is an <UNK> and one has sunk into <UNK> but the <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> by her <UNK> interest carries us along and makes us overlook the sometimes simplistic nature of the plot br br the cast are a who's who of talent leslie caron the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with her amazing high notes a last performance from joan <UNK> <UNK> joan a cute as a button <UNK> ian <UNK> having a ball and olympia dukakis as a money grabbing <UNK> living in the <UNK> of scotland with her <UNK> and her <UNK> the closing scene is standard <UNK> fare the <UNK> children of the star converted to fun loving supporters the old lovers reunited the youngsters swept up in the old <UNK> music life should be this simple but i would watch it again and intend to with my own <UNK> for in the right hands sometimes one just loves these <UNK> old clichés 8 out of 10
<START> this is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen i rented it as a joke expecting to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say i've never laughed so hard in my life the first scene where ninjas randomly pop out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moments of my life this is not a dinosaur movie but more a movie that makes fun and doesn't mean to at all of the action genre i didn't see the first two but judging by the complexity of the plot i don't think there's to much i missed if you wanna see a movie that goes great with a six pack or any <UNK> <UNK> than i insist you rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100 years of <UNK> in cinema get thrown in the trash and get <UNK> on by <UNK>
<START> honestly when i saw this movie years ago i immediately wanted to turn it off as i sat there for the next 10 minutes or so i realized that the actor playing <UNK> stole the show his facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to why he hasn't been in more comedies he has this marty <UNK> thing going for him but much much more talent taking nothing away from marty the movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original jerk but then again it was so much more i really think that if this movie was released first and i saw the steve martin movie 2nd i'd think the 2nd was a cheap rip off i know it sounds like a bold statement but it's true i actually like steve martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in the jerk too i wish i could get a copy of it for my collection i urge you to see it if you can find it
<START> <UNK> if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18 years old comics adapted movie rated 5 9 will you call me crazy that's just to catch your attention everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters it's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values dick tracy is one of those can't be easily outdated in terms of technology br br the negative reviews mainly complained about <UNK> messed up story but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and i had no problem following it i didn't see the comic books yet i am not a huge us comic fan but i appreciate the top notch film making and performances maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell but if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together what would you expect i had some <UNK> on my head and can't help but wonder did we really see the same movie the title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences madonna was more express less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story al pacino was funny and <UNK> to himself apparently he's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles we can see a hybrid of scarface michael <UNK> <UNK> hitler and robert de niro <UNK> our <UNK> to make us laugh and many thanks to make ups br br to me it's not bad at all the surreal feeling really got me
<START> it's rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product was br br i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as <UNK> and <UNK> we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from <UNK> yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically <UNK> population is the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other <UNK> in prison i understand <UNK> are in place but the political nature of the <UNK> are designed to prevent peace br br i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the <UNK> parents and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control it is more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ignored <UNK> for understanding and freedom ignored <UNK> for <UNK> for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land br br i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in a documentary however in the light of the lack of <UNK> it all seems exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it is a poor documentary and a poor film i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am <UNK> to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart wrenching and sad subject matter
<START> the big goodbye introduces us to the first <UNK> adventure in this case captain <UNK> posing as private investigator dixon hill this episodes creates some sort of standard pattern repeated several times on <UNK> as well as <UNK> 9 and voyager after entering the <UNK> something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game represented by the failure of the <UNK> safety program br br this concept is used to expand star <UNK> possibility and <UNK> a kind of genre mix <UNK> dixon hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as film noir often having the stereotype <UNK> in the lead see for example <UNK> <UNK> stories or <UNK> all time classic <UNK> star trek never focuses on the story mostly it's a simple how do we get out of here scenario but <UNK> the actors to take a different approach to their characters those <UNK> games are <UNK> used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound but did star trek ever had a technical scientific point to it i mean besides some <UNK> concepts br br the big goodbye shows a relaxed patrick stewart a <UNK> that hardly ever looked better in a star trek episode at least the early ones and data has some great scenes too although i find it hard to believe that pulling the <UNK> plug out of the wall would have really surprised him for the fact that he'd done research on that period and its customs wesley continues turning peaceful <UNK> into potential murderers why didn't they take him to the <UNK> and let the gangsters finish him off but all in all this one's fun
<START> this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid <UNK> 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when heath <UNK> priest partner <UNK> nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene answers on a <UNK> please br br i should have got a <UNK> for sticking with this film for it's entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the <UNK> than sit through this film again br br this should be cast into <UNK> bottom 100 hopefully my vote of 1 10 will help it on it's way
<START> this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr freeze <UNK> but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin <UNK> as batman bruce wayne tara strong as barbra gordon <UNK> <UNK> jr eli <UNK> as robin the villains are good such as <UNK> <UNK> as batwoman david <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> hector <UNK> as <UNK> so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the <UNK> so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good br br overall score out of br br out of
<START> in some ways the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination however no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close up shots i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people br br the writer appears to have simply lifted clichés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters the actors did not help matters no chemistry i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories however the writers didn't work very hard to develop the chemistry sure they're both attractive but whether they're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question br br the confidence <UNK> character shows in <UNK> developed far too quickly and for no particular reason <UNK> character is supposed to be a <UNK> doctor who just can't seem to play by the rules think of the jeff goldblum character in independence day usually that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance <UNK> character does not he's <UNK> with just the crazy and all the <UNK> skills of a magic eight ball he appears to be right by random chance br br the death scenes are comical every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them the <UNK> looked like bad <UNK> sort of like that video from the 80s peter gabriel i think
<START> this film does not fail to engage and move even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over produced sound and computer enhanced techniques br br the experience of the movie goer in <UNK> who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience br br one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure <UNK> and balance as this movie has silent film making was pure art it had to hold the attention through its structure direction and acting there was no padding out with more words or computer generated <UNK> a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable br br this film needs to be put into context for those who might be <UNK> with the mention of christian themes this is not a <UNK> film it is not selling anything these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era also church going on <UNK> was a national past time christianity was a given in most <UNK> thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then the themes would have <UNK> true and deep at the time br br it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie and it is not preaching religion to anyone only <UNK> the difference between <UNK> and the honest that in <UNK> a <UNK> in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd <UNK> pickford as an example of <UNK> along with some other individuals he named ny times <UNK> br br maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in <UNK> and learned some lessons br br the <UNK> complained that since the film industry had started church <UNK> had dropped 500 000 the film representative in the debate however made the following observations that saloon <UNK> had also dropped that there were far more <UNK> in prison than actors fact and that <UNK> a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole br br thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film br br this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices mary pickford naive honest <UNK> full of happiness and joy faithful humorous and <UNK> <UNK> though poor and <UNK> she represented the perfect character this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film br br this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly <UNK> revealed over the course of a film and it is this <UNK> that creates a stronger connection with the character br br it has a smooth even <UNK> for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound running dialog it was achieved through <UNK> acting and great directing it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you haven't hear a word spoken but it feels like you have heard everything br br the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope jean <UNK> and lloyd hughes br br the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the <UNK> of sweeping the snow a near perfect balance and ending this is a special type of touching humor that should not be <UNK> chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford br br another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored with the actors over exposure that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still couldn't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability
<START> this is unlike any other movie the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film but where as woody allen is constantly <UNK> human <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one <UNK> <UNK> that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of lou it is the root cause of his <UNK> which can be <UNK> back to a <UNK> child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backs br br there are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place so maybe we shouldn't fix our <UNK> anymore than we should fix our <UNK> or breasts br br this is an indie film shot on a long <UNK> but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film i feel like its a quirky gem for the self help market i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks although usually when a guy like this breaks through he goes off and makes x men and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they x men is <UNK> a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly
<START> first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another 20 minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken 10 15 minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first <UNK>
<START> actually one particular person character isn't right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and or big production sets but with a great story and very believable and good actors conveying the story arc br br you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies cinema such as tokyo story etc not so much story wise of course but more mood wise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed as with many of my reviews i'm not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up i'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever
<START> from the mind of robert <UNK> of psycho fame come four tales of <UNK> terror in this <UNK> anthology film which while not quite as much fun or scary as i would have liked still provides for some decent genre entertainment br br it's linked by the wrap around story of a highly skeptical scotland yard detective john bennett who is investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor he's advised that this case is linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place and our film is off and running br br method for murder has author charles <UNK> always delightful <UNK> elliott haunted by his latest fictional creation who has seemingly come to life this sequence has some good surreal and fairly suspenseful moments and is <UNK> by a reasonably amusing revelation and denouement br br <UNK> stars horror icon peter cushing as retired <UNK> philip grayson who along with old friend <UNK> rogers <UNK> <UNK> becomes obsessed with the image of a beautiful woman found in a macabre wax museum most effective in this episode is the dream sequence although it's great as always to watch cushing the final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking br br <UNK> to the sweet features another well loved horror star christopher lee as john reid who doesn't treat adorable <UNK> child jane chloe <UNK> with too much kindness and it's up to new companion <UNK> ann norton <UNK> dawn porter to find out why the mystery of this particular episode is handled excellently the film makers wisely don't tip their hand so it comes as more of a genuine shock as we get the full truth of this unhappy family the dying moments are particularly horrific br br the cloak has the most outright comedy of the four jon pertwee one of many actors to have played the role of dr who over the years is a lot of fun as a vain <UNK> horror movie star in fact he's the highlight of this story who <UNK> with the lack of quality in his latest low budget film goes out and buys his own cloak said cloak has strange powers which i dare not reveal here sexy ingrid pitt is a welcome presence as <UNK> companion one wonderful example of the humor here is a knowing <UNK> taken at none other than christopher lee br br the wrap up story then concludes in a predictable but still effective way as detective inspector <UNK> learns that he should have taken all of the <UNK> given him more seriously br br <UNK> by michael <UNK> unusual striking and eerie score the house that <UNK> blood is an entertaining mix of stories while i don't enjoy it quite as much as say tales from the crypt it's still good fun <UNK> directed by peter <UNK> it moves slowly but surely towards each of its chilling conclusions and is certainly a good film of its type br br 7 10
<START> having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it 's hard hitting impact and stellar acting of course one mr mickey rooney is indeed incredible in his role as the ring leading killer in reference to another review here none other than orson welles <UNK> mickey <UNK> name as the greatest movie actor also i also recall the <UNK> <UNK> score and the bare black and white photography i love the <UNK> last line before he goes out for his dose of lead <UNK> i think the <UNK> lifted it for a line in one of their songs get a grip on yourself this is a great film and <UNK> buried film let's get it out side note a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don <UNK> <UNK> nelson made a couple years before last mile and also starring mickey rooney another rave of the <UNK> intense and sympathetic performance perhaps it's the start of a <UNK> of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances
<START> i entered the theatre <UNK> to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not <UNK> i left neither entertained nor <UNK> this movie can't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything there are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references the 400 blows for this character come off it while none of the characters gets treated with much respect the over thirty gay men get the worst of it all <UNK> fat sad <UNK> if you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out <UNK> <UNK> longtime companion trick all over the guy red dirt maurice philadelphia instead you'll thank me br br
<START> sometimes lady luck smiles on me i had originally made and copied over a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation i was <UNK> when i realized what i had done since i had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else br br recently i <UNK> to digital cable and while searching through upcoming movies there to my surprise was a <UNK> broadcast of the movie this time however i made a copy of it to dvd so there's no chance of repeating my mistake br br i finally got to watch it again after eight years and it was just as exciting and tense as when i first saw it there is a little bit of <UNK> to this story in that my first contact with <UNK> clock came with a live reading of the book on public radio i just happened to tune in to the <UNK> station on my way home for lunch and from the first installment i was hooked each day i waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read br br when i learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on tv as a movie i made sure to clear my schedule for that event br br first of all i'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book contrary to what another reviewer had said that in itself is a rare achievement for tv movies br br secondly i agree with others about the casting i could not imagine a better choice for captain holland than richard dean anderson literally the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role anderson has never been better and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him in fact all of the cast members did a superb job br br my only complaint with the movie and the book was the <UNK> of the terrorist plot to arm a private business jet with air to air <UNK> and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane basically we are talking about less than <UNK> hours to <UNK> and <UNK> a plan like this one and folks that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved also not realistic was how little the <UNK> was affected by having first one then two of its <UNK> blown off br br that <UNK> aside i enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign <UNK> were portrayed in the film as well as our own br br if you have an opportunity to see this movie do so by all means
<START> i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to <UNK> something br br i'm not some old <UNK> from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a <UNK> b w picture of phil <UNK> jackie <UNK> etc br br <UNK> was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil <UNK> <UNK> courtesy of <UNK> i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve <UNK> travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil <UNK> i don't know maybe i would have br br some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a <UNK> admit that they haven't seen the original i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode if after watching the original ernie colonel hall <UNK> emma <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> et al you still think that steve <UNK> film is <UNK> anything above a <UNK> i'll stand you a <UNK>
<START> this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time after having just viewed it i can say it does not live up to those claims br br the idea of the movie is indeed demented but overall the execution wasn't at all cringe worthy even the final scene the <UNK> thing isn't really that nasty i was expecting something insane instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent sh t br br any one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed since there is no story whatsoever though surely most people know this gore fans will be disappointed since contrary to belief the blood and guts here are few and far between not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in history br br regardless of what people say this movie isn't that shocking it just plain all out sucks avoid it
<START> i am a sucker for films like this films that take you back and let you <UNK> your childhood i'm a grown up now and have many grown up <UNK> like a <UNK> kids dogs a wife and a slew of others i enjoy my life but it is not as innocent and <UNK> like it was when i was twelve mike <UNK> indian summer knows this and explores this like he was twelve years old it brings you back to a time when life was simpler and much more fun it brings you back to a time when worrying about your first kiss and wondering if you could finish the camp marathon were important issues indian summer is a fantastic film and it is one that should be watched at least once a year just so you can sit back and laugh and <UNK> br br the film stars kevin <UNK> bill paxton diane lane and matt craven to name a few as childhood friends that are being <UNK> back to camp <UNK> by their former head camp <UNK> uncle lou uncle lou is played perfectly by alan arkin he is kind of guy who is the <UNK> of the group he is also all knowing and <UNK> the true spirit of a father figure and someone who understands the simple things in life he has a hard time relating to today's kids that need a <UNK> <UNK> in their ears when they are at a place of immense beauty like <UNK> this is a camp that has <UNK> wandering through the camp leaves turning colours that god gave them and water for as far as the eye can see uncle lou <UNK> for the days of old and asks his former <UNK> back to the camp to see one of them will take over the camp while they are all together again we get to see their trials and <UNK> and perhaps a new love could spring between them br br as the adults return to the camp it isn't long before they act like kids again as the typical camp pranks get played all over again they take toilet paper out of the <UNK> the put <UNK> on sleeping <UNK> and so on all of this is done hilariously and with actors like <UNK> and paxton it is all very funny stuff br br but beyond the hilarity we get to explore some very real adult emotion that anyone can relate to in one of my favourite scenes kevin <UNK> and elizabeth <UNK> are <UNK> a bay where they used to go <UNK> as kids <UNK> can't get over how small it all looks and <UNK> finally tells him that the bay didn't get smaller they just got bigger it doesn't hammer the point home but it does it subtly we all grow up we all move on and we all unfortunately can't live like we did 20 years ago the more things change the more they stay the same br br indian summer is a character driven film and it is written beautifully by mike <UNK> who actually did attend camp camp <UNK> as did sam <UNK> who played stick in the film and it is his fond and vivid memories of his experiences that fuel the film there are many touching scenes and there are many hilarious ones also both are perfect br br i love this film i love everything about it and it is a true hidden gem br br 10 10
<START> great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in <UNK> laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we've heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett <UNK> father well sort of some have said johansson plays a young <UNK> keaton i beg to <UNK> she plays <UNK> dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feel like well a woody allen comedy that's fine for us woody <UNK> she certainly did <UNK> dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy melinda melinda some may find <UNK> humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when it's done right we look forward to the next
<START> how in the name of all that's holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie and that's all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more screaming br br i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened it doesn't except for screaming of course <UNK> enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of every shot looks like every other shot middle distance one angle dull dull dull br br it's not so bad it's good it's just plain bad
<START> the film is very complete in what it is keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father and <UNK> it with the <UNK> of serial murder one simply cannot go wrong the very plot in itself the very story and essence of the film is entertaining it is the sort of story that the director bill paxton could do so much with and in this case he really did do a lot with it br br from beginning to end you are kept <UNK> more and more about what is happening and where the film is going and the creativity that is behind this story is first class i felt as if this film was <UNK> done from start to finish and one of those rare gems that seemed to be without any boring <UNK> the action flowing neatly quickly and tightly from one scene to the next br br it demonstrates just how far people can go so as to do such horrible things to their loved ones and to do such acts of evil in the name of <UNK> when they are <UNK> as in this case it also is sometimes interesting in its' twists takes on the concept of morality as a whole br br overall this is the sort of film that one easily <UNK> but i would recommend you to not do likewise and to check this film out it is very much so worth your time
