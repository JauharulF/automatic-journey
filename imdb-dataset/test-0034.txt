<START> i don't understand all these bad reviews i believe this movie was one of the best in the puppet master series being made on a low budget one can comprehend why the special effects and acting were not spectacular but they were not completely horrible br br greg brought a lot of charisma to the role of andre <UNK> he has a lot of potential and i hope to see more of him soon and though the cinematography was not excellent and there was minimal violence and gore this film was a lot of fun i am a big puppet master fan and have grown to expect blood and gore from the films of this series but i can say that i was never bored through the entire course of watching retro puppet master so if you ever get an opportunity to see this movie don't automatically regard it as <UNK> of your time give it a chance you might like it
<START> this is by far the most vapid idiotic insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air and this is coming from someone who remembers san <UNK> beach <UNK> br br my wife loves watching reality shows and there was one episode of this drivel where the <UNK> had to develop a walk the end result was straight out of monty <UNK> <UNK> of silly walks sketch i couldn't laugh hard enough br br and then there's the <UNK> ms banks as in laughing all the way to the she has to be the most annoying self important woman on tv since <UNK> <UNK> left the view as if <UNK> was doing great things for mankind please i've never found her attractive and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the <UNK> to open her mouth br br someone needs to tell these human clothes <UNK> to eat a healthy <UNK> and actually look like real women
<START> as much as i hated the movie that this series follows i can at least says that was amusing the animated series is quite possibly one of the worst things ever produced the animation is quite often inconsistent although it does stay consistently bad the shape of a characters face is even capable of drastically changing in the same shot the script and voice acting also leave something to be desired since most of the cast seems about as talented as the cast of a third grade drama play characters like and dj are so forced into stereotypes of their <UNK> that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch not that the series isn't painful on a regular basis anyway episode plots seem to <UNK> to reach new levels of lame with every turn and are so full of plot holes it <UNK> me they had time to show commercials <UNK> it <UNK> me anyone <UNK> pay to <UNK> during the show in addition to being a bad series it is an even worse adaptation of street fighter many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie examples include ken and <UNK> being idiot con men even though ken is supposed to be rich <UNK> being friend charlie and <UNK> li being a reporter it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse
<START> david <UNK> and sarah brilliant acting had me in tears as many of the scenes were so familiar to me my husband suffered a sub in 1977 and required a major operation which involved <UNK> his brain and <UNK> the <UNK> like <UNK> i was naive enough to expect that he would return to being his former self after over 25 years of loving and caring for him he abandoned me without warning to go and live with a woman he hardly knew he then for and i am now going through a divorce i do hope the programme helped people to understand what it is like to cope with brain injury
<START> well i am a dancer so automatically i liked this film the only thing i didn't like was they didn't have much dancing as i thought there would be but i have to say the it was a good dance film i think there should be more songs too but it was a good film as i said before my rating 9 10
<START> i loved this film i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it i saw it opening night and loved it some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but i thought it was great the actors did great and it was scary and made me jump paris hilton did a great job for her first film everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role the set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made the two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great the killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them i can't wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again the over view of my review is go see this film if you like films and you will not be sorry i loved this film i give this film a 10 out of 10 it rocks
<START> imagine you have just been on a plane for 18 hours you have been on a business trip to south africa you are a high paid professional you've lived in the us for 20 years you are in your thirties you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way one thing even though you have a green card you are still egyptian on <UNK> you are asked to come with 2 security guards next thing you know you are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and after a brief but still reasonably civil <UNK> you are to be rendered this is what happens to <UNK> el at the beginning of the movie his is a story of pain and literally torture it's one of several story lines one follows his wife's attempts to get more information one follows the cold <UNK> behind the rendition another story deals with the family of the man who leads the <UNK> of <UNK> el there are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together though the more famous actors like reese <UNK> as the <UNK> pregnant wife jake <UNK> as the cia rookie forced to watch the <UNK> in northern africa and meryl streep as cia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart for me the actor playing the unfortunate mr el omar was the heart and soul of this movie his portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done it's almost as if he was being tortured for real also israeli actor was very impressive as the part worried family man and part extremely cruel chief of torture hard to watch and not exactly fun but still very worthwhile
<START> most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on <UNK> and <UNK> made at the height of those success br br sadly in the final moments of the film chaplin <UNK> all <UNK> of making art not to mention comedy and switches completely to propaganda and not anti nazi propaganda either but some of the most <UNK> and idiotic <UNK> propaganda ever to <UNK> out of hollywood br br never mind that nothing we have seen so far <UNK> that the <UNK> is even capable of giving the speech we see him give delivered ironically with a disturbing wild eyed <UNK> such <UNK> must not be <UNK> to <UNK> with the message
<START> in an industry dominated by men and in lack of products with a female mark on it is it always nice to see a film shown from the woman's point of view i would welcome more films from female writers and directors and i think lots of other women with me
<START> don't watch it here's a hint tune in to the last 5 minutes and you'll catch her in a bikini otherwise you'll just have to sit through the flick and endure her <UNK> sucking voice view for screen time with the inexplicable aussie accents of the lost city of atlantis or wherever the heck she goes to to locate her missing father we now know why kathy pursued a non speaking career of <UNK> she couldn't have survived the death <UNK> from those poor headache suffering victims who heard her voice for more than 30 seconds the rest of the story is some kind of weird poorly lit mad max <UNK> mash
<START> as everyone knows by now 15 park <UNK> is the story of a <UNK> girl and her half sister br br the <UNK> of <UNK> is still viewed as being an illness which people often feel might disappear if ignored there are also those who however far fetched it may seem when it's shown in the film think that the illness <UNK> itself as a result of some sort of supernatural influence i think ms <UNK> deserves a lot of praise for 15 park <UNK> she has done a good turn not only to the general public but also to those who deal with <UNK> relatives social workers psycho <UNK> the film actually helps in a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> about the exact nature of this psychological disorder i'm told that the film is largely based on her own personal experiences with a person very close to her who suffers from this mental <UNK> to that effect i'm sure that none of what has been shown is blown out of <UNK> on the contrary it is a true representation of facts br br the performances are good on the whole as can be expected <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and of course <UNK> are very good indeed they emerge as very real characters credible enough for one to be able to identify with them at times people may think me terribly <UNK> but i think there are moments when one can identify with as well i suppose all of us have a streak of insanity inside us perhaps some more than others these are the people who are <UNK> out after all don't we all have our secret fantasies and dreams impossible ones at times would we be dubbed as being off our <UNK> if people could glimpse into these areas of our minds would a person with low self <UNK> be considered a <UNK> because he she <UNK> company <UNK> instead to live in a world of his her own because that's the only space where there is a sense of security br br <UNK> as is outstanding her performance is so <UNK> she lives her part she has shown the ability to <UNK> the audience into forgetting the <UNK> between reality and acting a case in point is the part where she's <UNK> at the scene shown on tv of <UNK> <UNK> arrest her reaction seems so <UNK> and intense as if she's really heart broken at this tragedy her brand of indian english too is so spontaneous and natural br br however the same cannot be said for at least a couple of the other actors and <UNK> <UNK> splendid actors both seem ill at ease when delivering their dialogue in english their <UNK> is less than perfect stilted and affected the fact that they are making a supreme effort becomes more than apparent their dialogue delivery is jarring and tends to break the smooth flow of the unfolding of the tale br br the brutal rape of <UNK> seems somewhat unnecessary any other incident would have <UNK> just as well i feel the point here is that something <UNK> off the extreme <UNK> of the illness as the psychiatrist explains one cannot with any <UNK> of conviction or <UNK> say that the incident of the rape was <UNK> in bringing the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> towards <UNK> to the <UNK> then why are we subjected to the scene where lies bleeding and unconscious was ms <UNK> trying to make a social statement about the state of politics in our country where the voice of the masses is <UNK> by a handful of people who resort to violence in order to stay in power if so then the scene of the rape is <UNK> but not strictly in the context of the main body of the film br br the ending seems somewhat abrupt is the audience expected to find a solution where does disappear to does ms <UNK> want us to feel that perhaps what the psychiatrist says about whose reality is more real and hence credible holds true in other words is she trying to say that we are not without bias when judging who is on this side of the fine line between sanity and insanity i'm not very sure br br a thought provoking film on the whole and well worth watching however if you are the sort of person who likes things to be neat and <UNK> everything cut and <UNK> with a water tight solution to each issue that comes up this film is clearly not meant for you
<START> <UNK> felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film in fact the movie is a social commentary almost feels like a documentary at times luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe like in most of his movies br br of course <UNK> was an extreme of the current state of society but that's what makes most comedies funny a extreme of any situation fiction isn't that much different then reality br br with kids <UNK> hip hop culture and taking pride in being ignorant when people feel useless in life they breed giving them a purpose in the world and it seems only the worse people breed the most i can understand how others don't like it it doesn't help most of the jokes were 2nd grade bathroom humor not much different than a kevin smith film br br <UNK> throws away logic reason any intelligence for good reason br br mike judges comeback was a <UNK>
<START> don't look in the basement this little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the video <UNK> list the <UNK> <UNK> box soundtrack is classic the main character although way <UNK> than most low budget <UNK> is a pretty standard low budget lead the doctor masters character is well written and well acted some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie it's campy i ain't trying to lie the character that makes this great is a man child named sam one of the patients in this <UNK> gone mad flick the gore is pretty standard although i think the color of the blood is awesome it's so red this movie i believe was received poorly because of it advertising scheme some soulless little ad executive got his <UNK> hands on it and thought let's rip of the ad campaign for last house on the left that's doing well little <UNK> like this have ruined the world of film all balls and no brain also the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic maybe there all drunk you'll see what i mean one more little note don't buy this from the <UNK> mart dollar rack they have cut it to and unwatchable level try to find the longest cut you can
<START> i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years not <UNK> of course i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11 and it was so atrocious i almost walked out i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended anyway it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up i can finally give it the rating it deserves br br 1 10 that was strangely satisfying
<START> we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the <UNK> age with the likes of the four <UNK> 1939 and <UNK> simply because the <UNK> age was for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own <UNK> age br br america's projection of power under teddy <UNK> is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her <UNK> is smitten by the rough <UNK> <UNK> of her <UNK> who in turn is <UNK> by her beauty and <UNK> politically correct <UNK> eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way <UNK> and muslims are depicted here is far more <UNK> than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage what makes this story different are the terrific production values <UNK> photography composition and editing the terrific casting the <UNK> brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history br br though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean <UNK> noble <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> heroine john <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> or steve <UNK> <UNK> ruthless can do lieutenant <UNK> big stick there is a <UNK> scene at the end when the little boy is <UNK> swept away by the dashing <UNK> on his white <UNK> this is high adventure at its best
<START> i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid but i can't remember whether i watched it or not seeing it now considering how utterly forgettable it is i still don't know  so i counted it as a first viewing there have been several films featuring the title character a creation of <UNK> french author jules <UNK> these include 20 000 <UNK> under the sea 1954 with james mason in the role master of the world <UNK> vincent price mysterious island <UNK> herbert <UNK> captain <UNK> and the underwater city 1969 robert ryan and the mysterious island of captain <UNK> 1973 omar <UNK> br br this version stars academy award winner <UNK> however even if the premise itself isn't half bad  <UNK> from suspended animation in his submarine the <UNK> and finding himself in modern times <UNK> <UNK> all his <UNK> to aid the u s navy in <UNK> <UNK> scientist burgess meredith  it emerges as easily his most <UNK> adventure yet for instance five seconds into the film <UNK> assistant  <UNK> a steel mask  <UNK> that the world shall be <UNK> equally hilarious are the <UNK> <UNK> of the similarly <UNK> out midget whose task it is to fire the <UNK> all important <UNK> <UNK> and how about those <UNK> type <UNK> aboard <UNK> <UNK> who never seem to do much of anything br br <UNK> manages to maintain his dignity throughout but meredith is an embarrassment in what is virtually a <UNK> of his penguin characterization from the 1960s batman tv series and film where the budget was so tight  mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects no doubt and both evidently influenced by star wars 1977  that apparently they couldn't even afford him a decent costume he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub the supporting cast includes mel <UNK> playing a <UNK> in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production voyage to the bottom of the sea <UNK> and who <UNK> in a <UNK> routine with his <UNK> inside the engine room of the <UNK> <UNK> day george <UNK> she's the only female character around and <UNK> <UNK> as the king of atlantis  for whatever reason <UNK> is obsessed with <UNK> the famed lost continent br br by the way having been reduced from a three part mini series for theatrical <UNK> the film obviously feels choppy  though one is still able to <UNK> where one episode ended and another began
<START> i have to say when it comes to book to movie adaptations the bbc rarely lets me down now regarding this mini series i love the <UNK> novel it's by far the best murder mystery i've ever read the mini series it <UNK> made my day when i saw it the primary story was kept near perfectly intact the characters match the ones to the novel very well the personalities and mannerisms were spot on for red and <UNK> i thought <UNK> was done very well as was kate eric came off as too much of a simplistic character he had a little more depth in the book but they also altered his sub story so that may have had to deal with it of course there are changes but most are <UNK> but some i found disappointment in the sub story with eric murder charge was changed and that changed the whole dynamic between red and eric for the movie and they cut out the training <UNK> was doing some of the other events in the book are changed to be viewer friendly over all if you liked the book you will like this if you like the mini series then you'll love the book i must say this is the most accurate book to movie adaptation i've seen
<START> i watch a lot of movies dvd features and classics you name it the night i watched <UNK> mile my wife who had ordered it on the internet said she remembered it from when she was in high school that it had stayed with her all of these years somewhat reluctantly i sat down with our daughter son and was <UNK> from the opening sequence to the end titles we all were br br she who remembered the original and our kids 18 and 16 who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it our favorite scene bar none when peter <UNK> so <UNK> <UNK> his fist down and says i'd do it again it didn't <UNK> violence because it was a defense crime but <UNK> such intensity we couldn't believe it when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts there wasn't a dry eye in our house br br someone please make more movies like this one unbelievable
<START> isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent <UNK> and something that i would not get made fun of for watching i did see some episodes i should really be shot for this and had to sit through the movie now where do i find a gun and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes if you like seeing 500 foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by <UNK> about one foot tall this is a must see but it does get very boring after a while and with a show like this even original ideas become <UNK> dull the movie just felt like one overlong episode i can't remember any of it and the villain should have been far more <UNK> than a green monkey this show is a laughing stock it <UNK> out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while the ending will always be the same the <UNK> girls save the day all is good and nice but all is very very repetitive i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only cartoon on <UNK> to <UNK> around violence although it is aimed at girls so i won't be <UNK> in for it ever i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed 3 10
<START> in my opinion <UNK> army is <UNK> best british sitcom of all time i believe that if you just watch one episode of the show you cannot judge in completely on that one episode this include the movie you must at least watch a series of this show get inside the characters become familiar with there surroundings and the situations which they are in when you become familiar with the show then it will start appealing to you now the movie has a few changes to the series which is slightly disappointing but it still works watch a series or two of the show first before you watch this you'll not be disappointed good episode to watch is no spring for <UNK>
<START> corey <UNK> is never going to be known as one of the great actors of his time but at least in movies like <UNK> to drive he was more in his element <UNK> humor br br dean book <UNK> was one of his earlier works and still probably his finest to date sadly this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog a deranged mutant and a genetic experiment gone wrong is butchered horribly the acting is so lifeless you might think you're watching a zombie movie only the dog gives a respectable performance and if you want to see a decent movie about a dog you'd be better of watching the incredible journey <UNK> or even c h o m p s okay maybe not c h o m p s br br if you've read the book avoid this movie at all costs if you haven't read the book read it and avoid this movie you'll thank me later br br a somewhat better translation of a dean <UNK> book is the capable thriller <UNK>
<START> may contain spoilers ok it wasn't exactly as good as expected in fact it was a lot different than i had thought it would be but it still turned out to be a pretty good movie br br i usually don't care too much for that type of music but in this movie it worked perfectly i mean duh he's a rock star but anyway i loved stuart <UNK> in this and <UNK> although she had a small part in the movie was amazing br br and even though tom cruise played <UNK> in the interview with a vampire i have to admit that i am glad he turned down the role even though i normally hate when they use different people to play the same characters in like sequels and stuff br br overall the movie was great and i enjoyed watching it even if there were parts that could have been better great vampire movie
<START> in this episode locke and <UNK> go searching for the symbol that we saw during the lock down on a previous episode michael having shot <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> struggles with his actions as <UNK> <UNK> closer to death br br the most interesting thing about this episode i think is during the commercial break locke and <UNK> find a <UNK> under the plane that killed <UNK> in season one and a new training video ends with <UNK> the foundation 1989 in a following commercial break a rather bizarre and <UNK> commercial <UNK> the foundation a planted commercial and the website advertised www com leads the visitor through a world of information about life on the outside of <UNK> storyline a must see for all fans
<START> <UNK> <UNK> private <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sgt moore's jack <UNK> skills no explosions or bloodshed or hip soundtrack or sex it is set at the <UNK> island s c boot camp and most of the cast were actual marines memorable one liners abound and the closing <UNK> dedicated to is intense with such strong male and female characters this movie could not be made in today's <UNK> <UNK> world
<START> i still find it hard to believe that a fine if overlong novel by dean <UNK> was transformed into this utter <UNK> br br this movie is so bad it's disgusting <UNK> to all who <UNK> shame on you br br p s the fact that sequels have appeared just goes to show how little taste and <UNK> remains in silver screen land
<START> br br the kind of movie that demands too much from the audience yet to disappoint most of them i think of the mexican people who either in an attempt to support mexican movies or willing to see a film casting top mexican stars saw it half of the people went out of the theater when i went to watch it it's definitely not the kind of movie one could expect i think too of the people from other countries who <UNK> spending 2 hours seeing it till the very end what a piece of crap in order to understand de un one has to be mexican and one has to be familiar with the low middle classes or even better be part of them there's nothing accidental in this movie the family is and has what many families in mexico at least share one has to see it with a wide open mind to accept it entirely it's not the kind of movie that you fully understand after you watch it the older brother wouldn't let anyone sit on his red couch the sister is staying no matter how she wants to leave the younger brother is going to an <UNK> and all he cares about is the yellow radio the mother has to prepare the breakfast for the family no matter how tense and unbearable the situation is the father came back after who knows how long allowing the mother to live a night of passion that somehow turns out to be <UNK> and ends up by repeating all the attitudes of his sons the stories around the house are <UNK> and so is the movie a <UNK> looking for his penis a factory worker and his attempt of suicide by the kisses of his girlfriend a fat man riding his <UNK> after a interesting conversation about <UNK> with his sister wife mother the music doesn't pretend too much but it achieves a lot not more than a <UNK> drum <UNK> a some strings thanks good a movie like this was done and released br br one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it br br
<START> the main character is a whiny irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party she loses it at the drop of a hat acts pathetic is <UNK> and left me wondering why on earth she doesn't understand why these <UNK> of hers haven't called her in three years get a clue sister you're a juvenile mess i couldn't stand her or the friends i never felt connected to any of the characters to make the entire movie even more unbearable someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of and <UNK> hats in existence on film for all of eternity this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe <UNK> for a decade br br the acting wasn't awful but not really believable either and in the end the only thing that i did care about was the two hours i'm never going to get back don't waste your time go catch up on a dentist <UNK> instead
<START> minor spoilers br br if there's something in the world of silent <UNK> that <UNK> me it is that <UNK> chase never got his well deserved break through in the movies oh well maybe it isn't that strange really <UNK> as he never starred in any full length features but when i think of it such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features one explanation is that his character no matter how amusing was simply too realistic to suit a longer story without the <UNK> elements that chaplin keaton lloyd <UNK> and other comedians possessed it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more <UNK> i don't quite buy this though as <UNK> gag construction is magnificent and could i believe at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a <UNK> runs the show br br mr <UNK> isn't extraordinary handsome and mrs <UNK> is hardly a classic beauty he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet and she has a remarkably large nose both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge and when they meet by accident just a little later he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband a number of hilarious <UNK> begin with many clever gags all the way through i don't think i'll reveal anything further to make the viewing more enjoyable for you because if you're a fan of silent comedies or even if you aren't mighty like a <UNK> offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it silly indeed but no less extremely funny
<START> my 5 year old daughter is very into the <UNK> series of movies i've had mixed feelings about that not wanting her to buy into the whole <UNK> doll image of things and <UNK> that the movies are a marketing <UNK> to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for <UNK> this morning though she asked me to watch this movie with her and it being a lazy saturday morning and with not much else to do i agreed i don't know if the movies have been made to help market the dolls which seem to be losing their appeal a bit from what i've heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies or more likely a bit of both but <UNK> is the case i have to admit somewhat to my surprise this wasn't half bad br br it's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters both good and evil essentially played by <UNK> has to find a way to build a <UNK> of light to reverse the evil spells of the wizard who among other things has turned her sister into a flying horse and her parents into stone the animation here was pretty good not disney <UNK> if one thinks of disney as the standard to <UNK> to but generally pretty good and while the movie is obviously <UNK> to young girls rather than middle aged men i still found there were enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it was all going to turn out it's true that there were some holes in the story or at least some logical inconsistencies but again one must remember the target audience who wouldn't really think of such things this is an all around decent family movie 7 10
<START> 20 years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around never has a movie <UNK> valley girl's incredible soundtrack the movie completely <UNK> the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later nicolas cage at his best a movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes the special edition dvd is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as you'll have plenty of material to <UNK> through for sure
<START> no this has nothing to do with the sitcom seinfeld or its eccentric and hilarious character <UNK> kramer in reality kramer vs kramer is a fine drama movie without a doubt one of the finest of its kind and one of the greatest movies ever i'm glad that it won more oscars than apocalypse now because it really deserved such glory br br kramer vs kramer is an excellent film so well made and so perfectly balanced that i wouldn't change anything about it in any way there is nothing wrong with the film it's film making of the highest quality and it stands the test of time too not only it doesn't look any dated but also its cultural impact is long lasting and its realistic story remains just as significant as it was when it came out in 1979 a timeless classic they don't make movies like this today br br this movie is dramatic realistic simple but brilliant intense powerful sweet and even tragic and depressing sometimes yet it has fine humor as well it has no special effects but who cares this is not the movie or place to discuss such thing for a movie like this such thing would be pointless and absolutely unnecessary br br the story is very interesting the <UNK> chemistry is just perfect all of the actors are great but the 3 main ones are the very best dustin hoffman a brilliant actor has his greatest performance ever here as the lovable but distant <UNK> ted kramer meryl streep is great as ted's wife joanna and cute little justin henry is terrific as the loving but sometimes stubborn billy son of ted and joanna br br the soundtrack is all <UNK> and wonderful the opening song by the <UNK> <UNK> hand is brilliant the rest of the soundtrack is mostly antonio <UNK> classical music and is simply dazzling br br this motion picture has also an incredible development of the characters see the character ted kramer a <UNK> who becomes an amazing father after being left with no choice but to take care of his son trying to <UNK> these new <UNK> with his job after being left by his wife joanna with this ted learns about the most beautiful things in life but also realizes how though life is with the problems in his job and the return of joanna who wants the custody of their son but even joanna changes for better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when one sees this for the first time br br this movie has also some though things such as courtroom scenes where both ted and joanna face brutal character <UNK> unleashed by the lawyers another though thing to see is when poor billy falls off a jungle gym with his toy a plane and gets seriously injured on his face but then again the scene is very well made and what comes next is very intense his father runs quickly and crosses numerous <UNK> ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital br br overall this is a movie which is a good lesson of life br br this should definitely be on top 250
<START> having grown up a mormon and <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> towards blacks they were not allowed to hold the <UNK> <UNK> when i was a member i wasn't aware of the <UNK> policy of gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966 i was 20 i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were <UNK> even after serving on missions latter days exposes the <UNK> <UNK> of gay members the film is long <UNK> it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals latter days has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from <UNK> <UNK> the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and <UNK> his very soul
<START> i love so much about this movie the music the cinematography the acting the story and all the mormon clichés just because they are clichés doesn't mean they aren't true this is not perfect it is a movie after all though are held in well lit rooms with nice big <UNK> and <UNK> it was totally appropriate to portray it as the dark cold scene they did in this film i also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop smoking a cigarette i thought that was so cool i mean i believe that angels do watch over us what is one supposed to do while waiting smoking is a way some people pass the time while waiting i loved the irony cause <UNK> make such a deal about smoking i saw this movie 7 times in theaters in salt lake and cried every time it blows me away and i've watched it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time i would jump at the chance to see it again on a big screen i hope the tower theatre in salt lake will bring it back regularly at general <UNK> time as a cult movie pun intended but no offense intended
<START> this could have been a good tv movie but the flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie as they give the viewer <UNK> on the way will the movie proceeds i found myself wondering why she never said or mentioned that in the beginning then the whole trail would probably not have been necessary br br when the movie ends you understand why she shot and of course she is not guilty too bad that the producer director used the flashbacks this way but on the other had the movie would not have been worth while at all br br nice movie for a rainy day big bag of <UNK> to kill the evening
<START> this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row public <UNK> films from the first half of the 20th century or are a fan of amateur film making the film <UNK> together public <UNK> thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the actors with the sole exception of <UNK> doing a near dead on lugosi rip all of the performers are simply dreadful attempt to interact with the stock footage the new footage is covered with <UNK> added film <UNK> as is some of the already <UNK> old footage as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading this film while <UNK> a creative premise ala <UNK> men don't wear is a technical and creative wreck in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an <UNK> trip to <UNK> whatever that is the flashback then <UNK> weaves together old footage from totally different <UNK> and of totally <UNK> film quality unrelated scenes from 'the lost <UNK> <UNK> the most dangerous game 1932 white zombie 1932 bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla <UNK> and some other poverty row productions this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera br br the filmmakers seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of <UNK> by giving characters the <UNK> of famous actors carradine <UNK> etc etc this <UNK> was done cleverly as well as subtly in <UNK> here it's just obnoxious bizarre and painfully unfunny jokes about <UNK> dracula and superman abound even the old as dirt and lawyer reference is used here this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s br br the film stock and audio don't match scene to scene and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi the finale effect is that he seems to be getting older younger older thinner <UNK> younger and older again minute by minute oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and <UNK> a good chance for comedy br br truth be told though it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed maybe thats what they wanted to happen
<START> very cliched quite corny acting gets worse as the show goes on don't believe anything that folks say about the realism that this movie is supposed to portray it's just a <UNK> up interesting twist in that the <UNK> the base were given a human face and weren't portrayed as evil <UNK>
<START> well this was my first <UNK> experience so i was pretty blown away about that primarily although with <UNK> i can't help wishing that it had been some other less <UNK> film br br magnificent <UNK> very much had the programme for schools feel the way it listed all the <UNK> and this made it feel a lot like reading national <UNK> magazine in 3d <UNK> it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally <UNK> into reality and a lot of time it felt like some presentation there was a moment in the film when an <UNK> <UNK> opens seemingly at your feel that had a bit of a wow factor but to be honest that may have had more to do with me being an <UNK> virgin br br the commentary provided by tom hanks i personally found very what's a nice way to put it flag <UNK> which didn't go down too well in central london judging by remarks <UNK> as we left br br over all i loved the <UNK> experience but <UNK> wish a different film had been on on that day the moon isn't a particularly colourful subject and to be honest a lot of the 3d effects were lost in the <UNK> scenery all that would have been well were it not for the documentary <UNK> and <UNK> like the interviews with american <UNK> which spoiled it a bit
<START> not only do i think this was the best film of 1987 it's probably in my own <UNK> list as one of the 10 20 best films i've ever seen for whatever reason i really connected with this movie and it is one of the most personal films i had seen at that point in my life i was 26 for better or worse i strongly identified with the holly hunter character and i'm a guy she plays an extremely bright loyal and intense woman who couldn't figure out romantic relationships there were so many things that she said in this movie that were things that i would say or have said to others in similar circumstances and the ending of the movie i find to be so very very sad br br obviously this role was the big break for holly hunter clearly i was not the only one to think so highly of it
<START> this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far i would put it only second to all about lily <UNK> <UNK> because it kind of gives me the same <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some <UNK> money <UNK> in a time capsule at <UNK> <UNK> primary school they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey the second half moved me to tears as the movie progresses each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams but unfortunately ending somewhat badly in the end only 2 of the 9 <UNK> are left the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes a beautiful film directed fantastically this is a movie for people who have enjoyed other films such as <UNK>
<START> honestly on the subject of the death penalty i could take it or leave it the problem i have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love fest for the murderer with absolutely no sympathy for the family the execution of <UNK> jean with it's completely one sided view only <UNK> my view that she should have been executed for her crimes it tried to argue that she was mentally retarded but nothing in the video supported that view she seemed <UNK> but so did her entire family but that doesn't mean they were all retarded i can completely understand if someone is opposed to the death penalty but to completely ignore the crime as if it didn't happen and try to put <UNK> on some moral mountain top is offensive in nature and that's not the side of the issue i would be associated with
<START> his has to surely be one of the worst gay themed films of all time who told any of the so called actors that they can act bad sound bad script gestures so overboard that they defy reality a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes br br after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative but not plain pathetic br br parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe br br and the dvd no menu access its worse than a vhs tape once you start you have to watch the whole thing through luckily the fast forward button works with this film and dvd nothing else does
<START> from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence showing <UNK> as a murderer people who actually believe in the old testament will just sit there and shake their heads i am not a religious person at all but even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against god and the jews when <UNK> picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery i wanted to stone the writers i can't believe in this day and age that hallmark and abc disney would attempt to show such garbage as this don't we have enough problems in this world already
<START> in the literal sense br br reminds you of those cops and <UNK> or <UNK> indians role playing games you played with your 8 year old friends br br tedious and un inspired the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot but all it does is showcase it i cant believe john <UNK> let his name be associated with this piece of crap this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting <UNK> and editing br br destined to be a time filler on sci fi channel when they've <UNK> everything else from their library and barely better than the paid programming <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is about three teens who have been best friends for the longest time and go on the most messed up ride of their life when heroine becomes the choice drug in their town these three teens find themselves wrapped up in it all this movie portrays heroine addiction very well and is something you can't stop watching mtv has never been the best at doing made for tv movies but this one has to much good content to not watch it i enjoyed this film at the beginning i thought it would be the worst movie i've seen but then as it went on it got better and i couldn't turn away
<START> i am a huge randolph scott fan so i was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film the movie really belongs to robert ryan who is the hero in the jam and the one <UNK> in the love triangle good grief <UNK> hayes gets more screen time than mr scott in this movie for many viewers that is not a problem but i am from the walter brennan school of <UNK> not <UNK> hayes although i will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with randolph scott and john wayne br br personally i found the movie very slow going with a convoluted plot that was <UNK> even more by the unnecessary romance subplot by convoluted i don't mean impossible to understand or figure out i just mean too messy for its own good br br the direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come <UNK> at the end the whole movie comes across as fake unrealistic and poorly filmed br br just so you don't think i can't find anything good here br br on the plus side anne <UNK> is very sexy in her all too brief parts of this film not sure if it is actually her singing or someone else but whoever it was had a very pretty voice ms <UNK> also had a couple of nice acting moments the script needed either a lot more of her or to remove her character altogether as it was her nice few moments weren't enough to help the film br br lastly there is mr scott he looks fantastic in this film and is the no nonsense <UNK> out to set things right some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too <UNK> <UNK> perfect but that's never bothered me at all i'll take him <UNK> <UNK> pre 1950 or gritty and violent post 1950 either way randolph scott was a real western hero br br it <UNK> me to have to say it but i would have to recommend passing this film by unless you are a die hard fan there are so many better scott films out there that this one won't be missed
<START> and <UNK> around a 14 year old girl in a <UNK> <UNK> is one of them to fans of this movie i'd like to ask would you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like that and would your 14 year old be able to handle the reaction she'd get from men if yes i'd like to know why on both counts a suit like that is a clear <UNK> to men it's <UNK> to suggest that's not br br and on another point what teenage girl would ever claim her father was her lover without the excuse of severe mental problems that's almost as disgusting as the <UNK> br br simply put some things are just not funny or appropriate and they never will be
<START> contains spoilers br br this is a peter film if one has seen his bbc masterpieces and the war game one will recognize the style and his voice within seconds after the start made in 1971 it is set in a very near future when the vietnam war has <UNK> even more and now seems to involve china <UNK> is still president and civil <UNK> and protest is dealt with violently using <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> as judges because prison building can't keep up an alternative is introduced the punishment park <UNK> can choose between severe prison sentences and a man hunt in a hostile environment in this case a 85 <UNK> trip through the <UNK> desert at if they reach an american flag at the end without being caught by national guard or riot police they will be set free or else they have to serve their sentence or be dead as we will see the film is made in a completely documentary style with three european teams covering a <UNK> and the course of two groups already sentenced scenes jump between the <UNK> <UNK> the hunting troops and the hunted condemned <UNK> off commentary gives us raw background information time <UNK> etc the <UNK> scenes show a <UNK> court on the one side and a wide range of personalities on the other ranging from real terrorists over to clearly <UNK> e g a total <UNK> who can't even hurt flies the defense lawyer who does take his job seriously has to take abuse from both sides what makes these scenes especially eerie is their resemblance to the <UNK> of todays administration to the detail meanwhile some unfortunate events in the desert make clear that the of the <UNK> don't really apply the question remains open whether it is <UNK> from the start or <UNK> by the troops due to those events that leads to the outcome i suspect it is both at the end we are back at square one with the next group going to punishment park this description may indicate a heavily biased or even <UNK> propaganda movie but that would be misleading the behavior all participants were as usual with looks and sounds real the <UNK> scenes may even contain text material from real contemporary trials i'd say that this could be sold as the <UNK> <UNK> without problem with the forgotten faces the reaction was we can't send that or nobody will believe our real <UNK> anymore because this is <UNK> from the real thing with punishment park it ought to be the same effectively banned in the us as far as i know this is a must see that hasn't lost its power or its relevance especially today
<START> this movie is bad so bad that my mother who can barely stand the suspense of disney's snow white was <UNK> through out the entire movie my first warning should've been that it was in the 5 50 bin at wal mart but i have actually found some good movies in that bin so i can't fault if for this <UNK> the second warning should have been that when the <UNK> <UNK> up the dvd it was actually 3 <UNK> again i have never been one to ignore the <UNK> this movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch and it most certainly isn't for everyone that enjoys the occasional bad movie if you need background noise while you are doing something like playing cards with some friends then get this but if you are looking for something to actually watch don't even bother it was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors i felt like i was watching a chocolate version of <UNK>
<START> if you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and <UNK> for ninety minutes then this is the movie for you br br a waste of actors resources and audience time ultimately a waste of space don't be tempted by the resume there is nothing of any further substance beyond it the film lacks all of the <UNK> that you might expect from the genre plot character development denouement the cast may perhaps take heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be entirely forgettable and given time their careers may perhaps improve br br absolute tripe
<START> we sought out this hard to find vhs after watching two excellent <UNK> <UNK> pictures back to back knowing it was an instant box office failure a failure as a rental i thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on m <UNK> reputation too bad nine years ago it was very much a liberal agenda objective to trash the <UNK> fathers and indeed they had some success in <UNK> the <UNK> fathers from many american <UNK> including for example new jersey whose <UNK> of our great <UNK> quickly ended when the washington times <UNK> the spotlight of truth into the <UNK> school board and their <UNK> deed a small part of this was <UNK> the alleged sally <UNK> thomas <UNK> connection <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which failed to support the wacky agenda never mind they got james <UNK> an author of dubious reputation to put it in a book and columbia university sealed the deal by giving <UNK> a <UNK> br br as to <UNK> in paris the liberal agenda spin begins in the opening scene <UNK> james earl jones is claiming to be the son of <UNK> the spin simply continues in flashback mode to paris the <UNK> truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the <UNK> <UNK> would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of prolonged and vital <UNK> mission to paris as well as to the <UNK> where he <UNK> crucial financial backing for america when our <UNK> nation was without <UNK> br br besides the liberal spin job there is nothing else of interest in this drab and <UNK> dull movie some of the other history is indeed accurate adding <UNK> to frame the lie but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in american history and <UNK> it to a <UNK> for insomnia br br please do not ask me why <UNK> set out to trash the <UNK> fathers because i don't waste time explaining the acts of such people don't ask them either they usually respond to such questions with the same answer shut up
<START> this is one of those <UNK> and <UNK> cartoons that made this legendary pair second only to bugs bunny in terms of looney tunes popularity br br besides having all of the stock situations for this duo <UNK> feeding out of garbage <UNK> the i i a <UNK> <UNK> line etc s o s also stars <UNK> who is one of those types of supporting characters that these warner bros classics had in abundance to <UNK> the color and flavor of them this time out the cat and bird are aboard an ocean liner and the gags that are <UNK> from this situation are creative and lively br br what a day that was in cartoon history when <UNK> <UNK> decided to pair his <UNK> with the <UNK> robert <UNK> little yellow bird
<START> never have i sat down for six hours straight to watch a miniseries but changed that i'm not going to lie i know some aussie flicks can be pathetic and boring actually i quite like aussie flicks myself but maybe i'm biased but is on a completely different lane although not historically accurate as we are continually reminded the show combines superb acting an excellent script and the addition of humour to provide us with an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a <UNK> camp in wwii br br keep in mind the show was not supposed to be a documentary so don't let any factual errors disappoint you br br this series exposes such creative writing by john doyle aka roy who is known more for his comedy than anything else and an excellent director and actors move this creativity along perfectly if you want to see how much hard work went into this series visit the official website it is really interesting and you'll learn a lot about true accounts of br br if you haven't seen yet make sure you are doing nothing for a whole day because you'll want to watch the series in its entirety
<START> solo is an action movie about a terminator like <UNK> that is constructed and trained for the military when a flaw is discovered he is <UNK> to be rather than face death he chooses to flee into the <UNK> of central america where he takes <UNK> in a village the military chases him into there leading into a big action feast br br mario van <UNK> does a decent performance the <UNK> his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero and it works out the action scenes aren't that spectacular but they aren't all too bad either the acting from the other characters is pretty bad but i was not expecting anything too good the special effects were decent as well br br solo is decent as an action flick but very forgettable it lacks the substance that most movies possess but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking this will get the job done
<START> based on a william <UNK> short story two soldiers is a top notch short film a movie that has enough story emotion and great cinematography for a feature film and definitely leaves you wanting more in the end the story involves two dirt poor <UNK> brothers one only a kid the other old enough to <UNK> for the war effort shortly after the japanese attack on pearl harbor the younger brother played brilliantly by newcomer jonathan doesn't want to let his older brother go and he sets out on a quest to <UNK> in the army himself ron <UNK> gives a gruff but touching as the army colonel who decides to help the kid br br because it is only <UNK> minutes long this gem will be hard to find it will most likely be confined to the festival circuit for now but remember the name aaron schneider this picture marks him as a director to watch
<START> the <UNK> episodes of the lone ranger were originally broadcast on abc from 1949 to 1957 and then for many years they played in local <UNK> for most of the original broadcast years the series was <UNK> most watched piece of programming br br the new dvd set from pop <UNK> contains the first 16 episodes 15 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1949 and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season for a total of 17 episodes the same 17 available on last year's mill creek entertainment release so these are probably in the public <UNK> these sets pretty much render the legend of the lone ranger movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in <UNK> to form the movie are included in these releases br br the early episodes <UNK> back to radio as there is considerably more voice over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments br br the series itself was pure kiddie western with clear cut good and evil <UNK> and no romance the title character played by <UNK> moore started out texas ranger john reid the first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to lone ranger status his <UNK> with the indian <UNK> jay and the <UNK> of his horse silver br br there is an <UNK> code of positive morality <UNK> each episode the lone ranger is totally good but he <UNK> the <UNK> of evil while a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an indian was the lone ranger is feared by those who would do evil one <UNK> theme is that when the lone ranger and <UNK> first encounter an average citizen they are <UNK> with suspicion and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value the trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question who was that masked man br br to really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be if you don't take it seriously and keep wishing for some self <UNK> campy parody elements you will only get frustrated br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this review may contain spoilers or maybe not the warning is the same for all br br <UNK> it just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us this actually the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane deep blue sea etc that means a monster animal menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people in this case an alien in a train wow br br i must say that when i first saw this thing on cable i couldn't stop laughing no scifi film had prepared me for this it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical genre characters but since they're not so famous to say the least i wasn't expecting much of them except diamond phillips no comments there but i think the guy was desperate to find a job the problem was something called <UNK> <UNK> horrible even for scifi channel standards that model toy they made us believe it was a real train not to mention the model toy helicopter bigger than a <UNK> <UNK> the meteor coming from space the <UNK> alien a <UNK> puppet and i ain't <UNK> the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly while they were static when they started moving it was awful the explosions the terrorist blew up literally and what about the exploding helicopter just how many <UNK> of gas was that thing carrying the insane <UNK> used they couldn't even solve a school problem right and i won't talk about that <UNK> like ending by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying if i remember right i did both br br it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends but be warned it's so ridiculous at so many levels and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief
<START> this film is about aging geisha in post war tokyo played by the incredible lends money to two other ex geisha and <UNK> and they <UNK> the way she is somewhat smug about it has a son a daughter who during the film <UNK> they're leaving them while never a mother gets visits from two men in her past who it turns out just want money from her its a compelling tale of what choices you make what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and <UNK> to has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly <UNK> less than compassionate with an air of <UNK> that makes you not like her but at the same time almost envy her at a time when great films were made by <UNK> and kurosawa amongst others mr is right up there with him if you have a region free dvd player you should attempt to find the two box sets released in england i think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant that they are really not makes this film a <UNK> masterpiece
<START> this may not be the most <UNK> or incredible episode they've made but in my opinion it remains as one of star trek and the sci fi <UNK> most original episodes most ideas from retro sci fi series especially including star trek has been <UNK> several times this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph this among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the end br br another thing i like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and <UNK> and captivating story with such few special affects now without <UNK> the episode i must admit the effects are very dated but then again what can you expect from a tv show from 1967 but still the creature in this episode is basically just a carpet with some <UNK> rubber on it yet you forget this after about 1 minute and you only start thinking about it as what it's supposed to be also the <UNK> don't exactly look like rock but again you forget it after a few minutes this episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effects br br the acting from the main cast is as usual great this episode features the series second mind <UNK> by spock and is one of my favourites so to say it simple leonard <UNK> is definitely a scene <UNK> here and his acting is excellent not that kirk or bones don't get their share of the episode but spock is the most intriguing in this one i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but <UNK> around the trio handling an alien problem also it's nice to see an episode who doesn't only happen on the enterprise br br like most star trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind i won't spoil the story but <UNK> around what in the start seems like a typical monster story it has killed several humans and therefore must be killed but is that really all there is to it i can assure you that the explanation in the end will not disappoint you this is still my favourite star trek <UNK> episode and i give it a 10 10
<START> dear reader watch out this movie is not really a movie though its creators have the to call it so if you have not been warned about its content here it goes the film is simply a sequence of <UNK> which flow continually and are trying to <UNK> a certain feeling concept they could be called therefore symbols the images are accompanied by a soundtrack it's purpose being to create atmosphere as well however the images the director has chosen can only <UNK> feelings to an american audience because they are in an overwhelming number american icons though the film is intended to express the idea of <UNK> <UNK> it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos but also because it is far too long and tiresome and i strongly felt that a lot of the scenes have not to do with war in <UNK> conception to conclude i was greatly disappointed by a documentary which is not a documentary a movie which is not a movie a something whose only strong point is the extraordinary use of technology in image <UNK>
<START> i came out of rendition with a list of flaws a mile long so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a pretty decent movie it's definitely a film whose sum is better than its parts br br those parts include a cast of big name stars not one of them giving a memorable performance omar a relative unknown is the one you'll remember <UNK> if <UNK> direction and a screenplay that's both too complicated and too simplistic at the same time is an egyptian born american citizen who gets kidnapped by the u s <UNK> rendition program otherwise known as the process by which america <UNK> suspected terrorists into <UNK> information whether or not it's remotely true reese <UNK> plays his pregnant wife who calls in the favor of an old college friend peter <UNK> who works for a senator alan arkin and helps to track her husband down meryl streep plays the head of the rendition program jake <UNK> is a young agent assigned to the <UNK> and whose conscience gets in the way meanwhile a whole parallel storyline follows the daughter of a top egyptian official who is allied to the american rendition program and her boyfriend who's in training to become a suicide <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> that's a lot of plot to pack into a two hour movie and i was about to wash my hands of the whole thing especially the egyptian romeo and juliet subplot that felt like nothing more than a distraction but then near the film's finale a twist of <UNK> brings all of the plot <UNK> together in a way that makes you want to <UNK> everything you thought you knew about the motivations of the various characters and makes rendition a much more interesting movie than it seems like it's going to be br br <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all look like high school students playing adults twenty years older than they actually are <UNK> in particular usually a fine actor looks so bored that you wonder if he's going to <UNK> the energy to deliver his lines and the screenwriter should be arrested for having an actress as good as meryl streep at his <UNK> and giving her nothing more to work with than this one dimensional dragon lady the movie of course <UNK> for <UNK> but instead of addressing the <UNK> web of arguments surrounding the national security issue it charges right down the middle of the debate in a predictable fashion there are moments when you think maybe the film will <UNK> off in an interesting direction what if <UNK> did actually begin to doubt her husband's past for instance what if actually had been in contact with terrorists as his <UNK> but no the movie takes the path of least resistance br br but like i said <UNK> i recommend this movie i know i've done nothing but list a bunch of its faults but it's got its head in the right place and it is entertaining or at least as as entertaining as a movie about torture and <UNK> can be br br grade b
<START> this is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film i've seen in years the plot seen in print is almost banal a ship crashes on a desert planet with three <UNK> the survivors have to <UNK> to the landscape and each other then darkness falls and the monsters appear pilot <UNK> after a moment of <UNK> during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost <UNK> the passengers takes charge of the group and <UNK> the help of convicted murderer <UNK> to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship he's the one with <UNK> enhanced eyes that can see in the dark but it's really not that simple every character is complex three dimensional with <UNK> traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad br br the performances are uniformly superb <UNK> mitchell shows <UNK> herself for <UNK> <UNK> her own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed while cole <UNK> as the man taking <UNK> back to custody shows he has his own agenda and his own <UNK> standards but the film belongs to <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> he has the most <UNK> screen presence i've seen in years for much of the film his face is in shadow and he doesn't actually say a great deal but he draws your attention all the same sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking or by not moving and <UNK> doesn't <UNK> the character as could so easily be done by giving him a heart of gold <UNK> is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship he just lets us glimpse those first <UNK> steps from caring only for the self to caring for others br br technically the film is very good the lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum the triple <UNK> and the pitch darkness special effects showing both and the <UNK> points of view add to the suspense as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using to see the monsters themselves are <UNK> plausible and suitably frightening editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times there is literally no padding in this film no fades no time to re <UNK> yourself br br from the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you every scene every line of dialogue every single camera shot is important see it three times to understand it all br br my only <UNK> is about the science the <UNK> system as shown in the model is impossible planets <UNK> around <UNK> not vice versa however that doesn't affect the human story so i haven't taken points off for it
<START> this is probably my least favorite episode i lived in cape for quite some time i can tell you there is no ocean or <UNK> <UNK> fresh <UNK> or <UNK> anywhere near <UNK> cape is the only <UNK> cape it's on the <UNK> river it looked like the license <UNK> were from <UNK> which may explain why there was so much racial tension <UNK> and <UNK> are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route <UNK> this whole <UNK> was very distracting also cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated i did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene jo was more <UNK> style
<START> the <UNK> brothers have truly <UNK> themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped <UNK> though it is based on the odyssey the ancient work of homer you do not have to have read the odyssey to be able to follow the story the brothers <UNK> have woven a <UNK> of celluloid and <UNK> <UNK> the soundtrack is <UNK> to the film indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is <UNK> paper each character is wonderfully exploited and <UNK> back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds <UNK> <UNK> and authenticity george clooney is magnificent as the grease haired everett <UNK> <UNK> a honest con on the run whose pompous <UNK> and <UNK> are comical and endearing o brother where art <UNK> is easily the best <UNK> film to date as well as <UNK> best effort clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is tim blake <UNK> portrayal of the <UNK> friend <UNK> while the film itself is deserving of a best film nod
<START> at the beginning of this film which i found myself watching on <UNK> in the wee hours of the morning i was filled with a sense of <UNK> and general <UNK> the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didn't know if i wanted to continue watching although it didn't really seem to me that i had much of a choice so compelling was the situation br br gradually though that feeling of <UNK> <UNK> although it never really disappeared entirely and i felt drawn into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together br br really just a moving powerful story fit <UNK> into a tiny package i had no idea that sarah had anything to do with it until <UNK> her trivia so now i love it even more br br i definitely recommend it if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime or <UNK> enough to figure out some other way to view it
<START> caught this movie on <UNK> while flipping channels and thank heavens that too when it just started having studied in this film touched off many happy memories of the city that apart one wonders why more movies like this aren't made every character is so well <UNK> the grandpa the kid the doc except for the social worker who <UNK> a tad the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw a deserving entry for the oscars even if it wasn't nominated definitely leaves a <UNK> in the throat who u need <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> and to think that this movie needed <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> it <UNK> of being in <UNK> there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie the subtitles were good a must watch for any fan of good cinema
<START> my gosh this movie was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers struggling salesman can't make a go of it in new york mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing struggling salesman moves to california and makes it big then loses it big then <UNK> back with the simple life then hits rock bottom trying to get back to the top i don't think i can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop case in point spoiler when the john character calls to say he and his girlfriend were coming to santa <UNK> to visit and james woods says there's practically no chance he would come you knew with 100 <UNK> they were coming in the next scene or two br br on the other hand sean young sure looked good
<START> what an awful movie full of cliches <UNK> scenes very bad acting and an script it is hard to believe the same guys that wrote the people vs larry <UNK> and man on the moon wrote this garbage man this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all time didn't this guy this director if you can call him that realize that the first problem child was bad enough let alone make a sequel for it amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released 1 out of 10 's
<START> i am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive having read the book several times and all the other historical novels by there is no way to say much good in this film if i forget the origins of the story i might consider it a reasonably good epic of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be <UNK> but it could be done with class i can't understand why even the name of had to be <UNK> to just i love peter ustinov as and marlon brando probably would have made a better but the overall attitude is too hollywood to ever make justice to the book mind you left the <UNK> of this film in the middle of the showing that's how much he liked it
<START> just before dawn is an underrated horror film from the early eighties i haven't seen it in years but it had a great impact when i watched it quite original for its day the only problem is that it has not been released on video or dvd for years if you like horror i urge you to check this little gem out
<START> strange enough shorts like this get a 10 why they are hilarious this is hilarious notice a lot of the quirky humor dated and childish to <UNK> <UNK> but they don't know what they're talking about they got to know that cartoons aren't just for kids the art in this is the best non road runner art of the 1950's looney tunes shorts it's hard to come across something better than the art in the great <UNK> bank robbery although nothing ever will this runs a close 3rd or 2nd shorts like this one might have <UNK> witless lt rip offs like tiny <UNK> adventures to try to squeeze out all the old comedy out over and over again like how great movies like scream <UNK> crap like i know which was released just to squeeze out all the old horror from scream but like scream this is great alone chuck jones has had his faults with shorts once in a while but he does make up for them take hopper for example few people like hopper but it never ruined the lt reputation but i'm sure this was his make up on things as such bottom line this is not as good as duck rabbit duck but close catch it on cartoon network frequently
<START> this show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror tv shows like tales from the <UNK> also from the same creators this show is a rare gem if you agree with me please sign this <UNK> i started to get the word out for monsters and get it out on dvd here is the <UNK> address www <UNK> com <UNK> <UNK> some of my favorite episodes would have to be and rain dance i also loved the opening intro with the monster family that used to creep me out one of the things i would have to ask the dvd creators to include would be the <UNK> sound heard right before where the commercial break would be i don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me i mean come on war of the worlds the tv series already has been released on dvd so i say monsters and also tales from the <UNK> and friday the 13th the series should be released too we the fans need to speak our minds we need this awesome show on dvd so please spread the word
<START> yet another in the long line of don't films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that this film is a highly <UNK> low budget with a twist it has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly <UNK> performances of the surprisingly talented actors actresses that make this movie good a young nurse arrives at dr <UNK> mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be it seems dr masters a rather ambitious female doctor has taken over his duties and begun to <UNK> her own ideas each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions there is the <UNK> the crazy old <UNK> the woman with an <UNK> obsession with <UNK> and a man who has <UNK> back to his childhood among others there is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies <UNK> up if you are a fan of cheap 70's sleaze than this is the film for you
<START> <UNK> edge is an excellent film and it's a shame that it hasn't made more of a mark for itself in cinematic history there were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties but of all the ones i've seen this is certainly the most <UNK> and disturbing the film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage <UNK> and their <UNK> attitude about things which takes the story onto another level the film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters the film begins with a murder we then follow the murderer <UNK> john as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done rather than give the expected reaction most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from who makes it his number one <UNK> to help john clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it the other friends <UNK> over the crime and before long one of them goes to the police br br <UNK> edge features a host of great performances from its young cast keanu reeves has a reputation for wooden acting and for good reason but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best <UNK> glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane glover always stands out in every film he's in and while he does go over the top a little bit he convinces well as the lead in this movie reeves and glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes daniel <UNK> and joshua john miller as well as the great dennis hopper in another wild role the film features a very gritty picture which <UNK> well with its <UNK> tone the central characters are all of the generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined the film is also rather funny <UNK> to some of the characters' lines but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy overall this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing
<START> this film is absolute cinematic genius it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie jack long plays the part of <UNK> white exceptionally well he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie <UNK> this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin this film is definitely 10 10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time
<START> if you like cagney you'll like this film it has the <UNK> of american integrity at any cost personal or social cagney plays the head of <UNK> and <UNK> in nyc cagney goes up against crooked politicians the criminal underground a prominent <UNK> and simple who add a few <UNK> to the price of a chicken the chicken scene is hilarious where cagney finds a weight placed in the bird <UNK> by an unsuspecting butcher the chicken gets tossed around the shop in a hilarious scene about who controls the evidence if you like old <UNK> there are interesting scenes of phones and even bizarre phone <UNK> compared to a lot of film made today this is pure entertainment and includes mystery with comedy and a message that honesty above all should be the <UNK> principle of humanity made in simpler times it reflects a world we can't find today the fashion especially hats and <UNK> all play a prominent visual role in defining this little film
<START> george really went all out and over the top which in this case was great i've heard the <UNK> version but it was too tame george was great in that character very <UNK> br br angela lansbury was perfect for the part she gave a great performance she gave the mrs <UNK> a great <UNK> and comical personality which balanced out the dark story br br i love the dark humor when angela lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of george in his songs of rage vengeance and distress br br i've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when i saw it on <UNK> i bought it on video after <UNK> it in 1985 on my own when it came out in 1990 and i definitely bought a copy of the dvd when it came out in 2004
<START> the only <UNK> flaw of this film is it's title please stop comparing it to the first i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you haven't seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and <UNK> a different name for this there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own this is a great <UNK> of <UNK> mid 80s comedy i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the <UNK> <UNK> should love this little <UNK> i maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title i usually hate movies like these i e adam sandler will farrell <UNK> bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically i <UNK> maybe it's like a bad relationship i can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'the stunt man ' br br robert stack we love you <UNK> 2003
<START> an opera <UNK> has an accident which leaves the door open for her to take over the role betty is now the star of mac beth but someone hiding in the <UNK> has an opera of his own planned out he gets his kicks out of <UNK> betty up putting <UNK> under her eyes so she cant close them and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes br br opera is certainly one of <UNK> more ambitious films like mixing it up with <UNK> there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is <UNK> <UNK> version of <UNK> but also <UNK> just like shakespeare uses <UNK> as an omen of death and misfortune and like the <UNK> <UNK> the castle foreboding the demise of the scheming <UNK> the <UNK> in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the of his lover but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or <UNK> the similarities are far too subtle it's just a typical <UNK> <UNK> and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid <UNK> of gothic <UNK> br br although this movie does have it <UNK> like the metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange br br all in all opera is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good
<START> i finally managed to get myself a copy of <UNK> <UNK> opera and i tell you that was about time it was the last <UNK> movie i had yet to see and i'm a fan of most of his work i <UNK> that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint like <UNK> but the plot idea of opera always <UNK> to me and it turns out i was right i enjoyed every shot in opera and i was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last out of all the <UNK> movies opera went straight to the number one spot and i hope i can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well br br the script and plot idea of opera is rather simple especially compared to <UNK> previous movie <UNK> that had too many ideas in it and ended up being a mess the plot of opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it's an excellent <UNK> comment almost a spoof towards the opponents of explicit violence spoilers a young opera singer the gorgeous <UNK> is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer during every massacre he commits he forces betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open there are <UNK> attached to her <UNK> and when she <UNK> them they're getting torn apart end spoilers to this simple yet effective idea <UNK> adds a lot of horrific elements like <UNK> the classic piece and curse of <UNK> and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music especially the presence of the creepy <UNK> are and extra value ancient masters like edgar allen poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them and <UNK> <UNK> knows it as well br br the violence and gore is very well presented in opera and that's what makes this a true <UNK> picture his best in my opinion with <UNK> <UNK> as a close second i surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you especially for fans of the italian horror business this is an absolute must favorite <UNK> scene <UNK> shows his visual talent the best in the scene where <UNK> friend is getting shot in the eye while she's trying to see who's in front of the door
<START> as a late going <UNK> of the drive in 1970's 1980s there are many movies that i have seen forgotten this is one i could never forget despite its low budget exploitation style of movie making the story was very well done the isolated therapy asylum where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene the supposed assistant doctor taking over the various crazy the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself and finally the rescue of the young nurse by the simple minded sam who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape <UNK> made for a great story which held the film together i <UNK> the word story because that's what makes a good or great film no matter how much blood gore nudity sexual matter or outrageous behaviour you put in a film if the story is not good then the film is not good the film credits show clips of all the actors including the old <UNK> with the final line telling you to get out never come back which is a great ending to this film if it is out on video dvd see it enjoy it
<START> this is a film that every child should see before they grow and get distorted often passed down ideas from generation to generation of family i grew up in two different places although only 20 miles apart i went to school had friends of every color <UNK> religion for the first 8 years of my life then i moved to <UNK> country although not anymore where it was very unusual to even have one african american kid in your class my <UNK> class in high school had 2 or 3 african god why can't i just say black you can call me a <UNK> or <UNK> or whatever all of this political correctness <UNK> me as it does most others anyway back to the film give this a try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or a lack of understanding does to a culture or a country this is an excellent film everyone should see especially children
<START> like richard <UNK> mason never got the material he deserved whatever you know of him is probably wrong get past the accent and go see his stand up you'll be very surprised he's one of the best stand ups i've ever seen and i have seen a lot of stand up comedy from <UNK> bruce to eddie murphy to jerry seinfeld to chris rock jackie mason is definitely up there he's known for being a <UNK> comic even howard stern said he is one of the top 3 funniest comedians ever br br the that mason is no <UNK> is ridiculous <UNK> is known for having been a huge mason fan <UNK> career was going nowhere for a long time until he started following <UNK> shows that is when mason provided <UNK> with inspiration for his get no respect routine while i think <UNK> is great see them both do stand up and you'll see mason is the better comedian
<START> the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john <UNK> masterful direction coupled with <UNK> superb cinematography some of the <UNK> tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate is particularly good as the <UNK> of the bad it's a role <UNK> the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before normally played a hero and in fact with his <UNK> i didn't even recognize him at first <UNK> goofy buck teeth only make an already <UNK> character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a <UNK> and i believe i actually <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> somewhere along the way <UNK> as the lead is nothing less than magnificent
<START> ok <UNK> is not a <UNK> of the <UNK> genre but nevertheless it is well done good actors <UNK> and at first and some nice ideas made me happy maybe i would have been not so positive if this <UNK> a german movie but who cares it is good to see familiar faces in a good thrilling story with some gore and some good jokes in it all of you complaining about the dubbing i <UNK> see a dubbed version of course but i believe that it is not easy for you to watch dubbed movies we germans are used to watch movies like that so it´s not a big problem but try to watch in german with subtitles the actors are really good
<START> travolta thurman the rock vaughn keitel and so on one should think that this star parade of great actors could really heat up this movie but no travolta takes on the role as <UNK> <UNK> again but this time we have already seen the gangster who tries hes luck in the hard world of movie making its not funny anymore this is a typically problem in hollywood they think that if the first was good the second will be twice as good no the first was original the second cant be hey hollywood try to understand originality cant be <UNK> you got to give us a new twist not just the same movie again made with a bigger budget i constantly found my <UNK> hardly laughing when i was watching this movie but still it got a lot of cool actors like harvey keitel james woods vince vaughn and the rock and for that and that only br br 4 10
<START> i just got it and it is a great movie i loved it although jane voice n the beginning is so annoying because of her <UNK> she don't open her freaking mouth but ya have to watch it cause its a great movie the things he says in here are so funny and extremely cute and i'm sure aaron would probably say some of the things in real life cause i don't know it just seems that way ha ha there is a part in <UNK> movie that is really funny its <UNK> jane's little sister meets him but i cant tell ya what happens cause ill just have to let u see for your self i went to go see aaron n concert and it was so much fun n he <UNK> so good ha ha i still cant believe i got to meet him i have pictures if anyone wants to see them <UNK>
<START> in the first transformation scene what is the music i've heard it was the <UNK> don't get no is that right i really liked that sound i also liked the <UNK> got nothing to hide in the final scenes truly a movie but with many laughs and <UNK> sight gags and slapstick <UNK> woo <UNK> place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself <UNK> <UNK> has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing she looks much different in the movie we're talking about but her maturity didn't hurt her a bit mark <UNK> reminds one of gene wilder in some ways <UNK> armstrong was beautiful and <UNK> her beauty for a long time
<START> the combination of amazing special effects and oscar worthy acting makes the one of the most important sci fi films of recent years for some reason still unknown to me this gem was found in a bargain bin why some worthless human thought it right to dirty a modern classic by to a bargain bin is beyond me i have never been so terrified by a man in tin foil and random bursts of fire forget terminator <UNK> aliens and other films that ripped off this masterpiece the is an <UNK> force

<START> this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s it's not that good but really not so bad either there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired don't <UNK> in god's <UNK> b movie fare there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico br br the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from <UNK> the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy but dad has the idea of <UNK> a <UNK> heart for his son's to save his life i don't know i'm a lawyer not a doctor the transplant works but sonny boy ends up becoming a man ape who <UNK> nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler this really didn't add too much but if they wanted to throw in some masked female <UNK> here's a good reason to do so br br the film was kind of cheap but not too bad for a b movie of the day the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well however this film is kind of fun in its own way i don't know why maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie <UNK> i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things br br watch it if you like cheesy foreign films nudity and female <UNK>
<START> this movie was so bad i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it it was all i could do to sit through it the beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising only it <UNK> of saving private ryan to me or at least an attempt at it only we don't care for these people there was no build up to the characters the kid that dies i guess was suppose to make us cry but for some reason it just irritated everyone then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to <UNK> <UNK> heights which of course was also <UNK> in the movie go figure there was nothing original about the movie at all it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better sadly it doesn't 3 hours later i leave the theater feeling cheated anthony should be shot for trying to <UNK> the english patient which for it's time was a good movie but now i wonder should i rent it and make sure i wasn't just caught up in the hype maybe i was but i definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film i really went to the theater wanting to like this movie i am a die hard nicole kidman fan save your money rent it on dvd and laugh through it as i did
<START> my ratings acting 3 10 suspense 2 10 character <UNK> 1 10 plot 2 10 character development 2 10 overall 2 10 br br this show sucks very much officially for me <UNK> miami is the best <UNK> ny 2nd and <UNK> <UNK> i don't know in the other you get into the episode you're watching but in this one you just can't get into the episode no matter how much you try so in my opinion this show is not worth watching i know people have different opinions and i respect that but for me this <UNK> ain't good enough so if you like suspense real acting performance good plot direction character development <UNK> and you an overall good show i suggest you to watch <UNK> miami
<START> really enjoyed <UNK> from heaven if you liked my big fat greek wedding you will like this too once the story line is set it begins to keep you guessing the outcome i think we'll be hearing more from five sisters productions i know i'll be watching for their next movie
<START> a great gangster flick with brilliant performances by well known actors with great action scenes well not this one br br it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well known actors that have many good movies in their <UNK> in such a movie without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in br br first of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is when i thought the two hours should be almost over i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed br br the action scenes look a lot like those from <UNK> tv series the a team for example it's just that in the <UNK> <UNK> with the a team those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in el <UNK> it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through br br the acting fits quite nicely to the action either you get the same reaction to everything that happens dolph lundgren style or it's so <UNK> that you may think it's a parody but unfortunately it's not br br my advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one
<START> portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a <UNK> in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the women you will ever encounter sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off beat characters and bring their humanity to <UNK> of any film she makes as the mother of this obviously brilliant and beyond her years young girl sarandon <UNK> between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer more importantly she does it with strength and <UNK> without <UNK> all over <UNK> portrayal of the daughter the question is always asked when we <UNK> the film plot who changes this film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also the hallmark of fine drama
<START> as a former <UNK> student i enjoyed this film very much it was so realistic and funny it really picked up the spirit that exists among <UNK> students i hope many other students will follow this experience too however i wonder if this movie is all that interesting to watch for people with no international experience but at least one of my friends who has never gone on <UNK> also enjoyed it very much i give it 9 out of 10
<START> developing movies that are based on actual events involving <UNK> or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters you have to mainly <UNK> reported <UNK> <UNK> info sources and hollywood creativity to produce something the audience can get into unfortunately for sasquatch none of these things seem to take place br br the movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the via airplane from there the research team disappears and despite attempts from law <UNK> officials and local rescue parties they remain missing for some time while one of the passengers is walking <UNK> red like images are <UNK> on the screen a la predator which subtly hint that the legendary sasquatch is the cause of the <UNK> <UNK> br br cue <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and father of one of the crash victims <UNK> puts together his own search rescue team with the explicit mission of finding his daughter and the rest of the research crew along with the <UNK> technology lost during the crash br br after <UNK> <UNK> made rescue team is put together the entire movie <UNK> down the path of characters <UNK> cinematography and a totally unoriginal plot line i literally had to keep myself from falling asleep during this movie as it attempted to <UNK> me out of my wits the only member of the cast that held his own was <UNK> which doesn't make up for the lack of depth presented in all of the other characters the over done sound effects were annoying as well basically i didn't know if i was watching a movie about bigfoot or <UNK> bears br br neither was the plot line all that great it was too underdeveloped as the viewer is mainly subjected to typical fright music found in anything similar of the genre obviously you didn't have to be a genius to figure out who would be pulling off all their clothes by the middle of the movie or who'd be the first unlucky soul to get <UNK> by mr sasquatch as far as good points there are none and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10
<START> if you are french native then you find this movie extremely funny it's good just good can though imagine that subtitles or <UNK> don't mean much in english
<START> i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest <UNK> areas in the country <UNK> dallas austin san antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears <UNK> cowboy hat talks with a <UNK> has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip <UNK> <UNK> shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police truck anywhere in texas br br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like <UNK> look like high brow entertainment at least <UNK> had the talking car
<START> a tale of two sisters is a brilliant south korean psychological horror that left me speechless the film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy the small cast of actors is truly excellent with lead im <UNK> <UNK> being especially memorable in the lead role the direction by kim <UNK> is well handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous the plot is slightly confusing but some scenes are wonderfully eerie the action is rather slow but i was not bored in the slightest i was extremely curious and intrigued the house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated a tale of two sisters is along with <UNK> and <UNK> one of the most original asian horror films i have ever seen watch this masterpiece as soon as possible my rating 10 out of 10
<START> the movie invites comparisons to shakespeare the <UNK> is beautifully written and spoken and the plot is intricate and intriguing never has <UNK> li looked better never has the glory that is china been better represented on the screen the balance between political turmoil and personal intrigue that gladiator hinted at but never really delivered is here in <UNK> simply incredible
<START> ho hum rich good looking kid gets in trouble poor girl falls in love with him jealous ex boyfriend causes tension <UNK> <UNK> i actually laughed out loud in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid as one scene moved on to the next i often found myself wondering just how we got there like i had <UNK> a few chapters in a book br br the script was pretty pitiful and didn't have me or my wife caring much about any of the characters except the <UNK> boyfriend now if the ex boyfriend had gotten an axe and <UNK> apart the girl and rich kid then then we would have a movie and all the stupid dialog and leaps in plot could be acceptable but since this movie attempts to be touching and totally misses the boat and ends up <UNK> to the romance equivalent of divine <UNK> to try and jerk a tear it just falls very very flat br br avoid this movie clip your <UNK> instead you will have more fun
<START> i watched the halloween episode oh my god i wanted to die the acting was just awful the lines were <UNK> with absolutely no conviction its a bad idea for a show as well i mean who would watch some web show like that in real life miranda <UNK> was great in a supporting role in drake and josh but doesn't have the force of character to anchor her own show i'm even more upset because her leaving is a major reason why drake and josh ended she was approached with her own show she jumped ship on drake and josh they then decided that maybe they would do a thing with drake and josh moving to college thereby explaining the loss of <UNK> as a character but drake had already had thoughts of moving on to bigger and better things and he figured if miranda did it why couldn't he the best part of the show was the theme song a catchy good tune in a <UNK> of mediocrity of course drake bell was dubbing <UNK> voice for the whole thing and wrote the tune
<START> i am left with little choice but to employ it at least once during the course of my review of among other things what <UNK> <UNK> is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the author's part seems made with an all too contrived and self aware intent to be artistic symbolic spiritual provocative <UNK> mythical even but luckily for all true artists out there a <UNK> formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth doesn't exist stunning natural locations yes these remote parts of southern italy look exotic even to most other italians pretty actors and some amusing <UNK> spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive children won't elevate a <UNK> movie beyond a pretty succession of images yet this <UNK> and vain and ultimately hollow movie to be art <UNK> only to a very limited extent perhaps in some cases by accident i'll admit that the <UNK> pompous ending does have a certain visual poetry to it however it's my belief that this was achieved in ways that had more to do with the beauty of the sea and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water connecting it to so much that's mythical mystical religious <UNK> etc than with talent br br <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> and affected in her performance as <UNK> for a mentally unstable woman from a humble and <UNK> background she sure has a <UNK> wardrobe her <UNK> <UNK> dresses and attractive sun <UNK> beach hair could have <UNK> the pages of any <UNK> summer edition the fact she was a <UNK> could in a way have been nothing but a <UNK> addition to her trendy <UNK> and look that's how skin deep her condition seemed to me two dimensional stereotype of the innocent natural child woman misunderstood and <UNK> by her <UNK> community was tiresome and irritating at worse while leaving me <UNK> and indifferent at best i agree with the reviewer from london who wrote that mental illness is very badly served by cinema during the course of the entire movie we never really get a sense of illness and have no idea what is actually wrong with her other than her being a tiresome stereotype of a free spirit we don't know why she's given <UNK> and is required to see a <UNK> in <UNK> this generic way of writing mental illness is one of the main tell tale signs of the movie's overall <UNK> br br another fairly insulting aspect of is the of its location i <UNK> to figure out whether this movie was supposed to be set in the present day or the past seeing as it aimed to make even an admittedly <UNK> part of italy by comparison seem a dozen times and more conveniently primitive than it actually is again this <UNK> of <UNK> and a complete lack of sincerity on part some non italian viewers will <UNK> lap up the <UNK> the cliché of the <UNK> macho italian man as if it were common place so keen will they be to continue viewing my country as one <UNK> stranded sometime in the 1950s the question i'd like to ask david <UNK> the reviewer from dallas texas is as follows is your country's mentality stuck in the 1950s no ok then why should mine be unfortunately for whoever still wishes to view italy in such an <UNK> way that aspect of is actually ridiculous and <UNK> even in the eyes of this italian viewer the subtly incestuous tension between <UNK> and her <UNK> son was as tiresome and predictable as <UNK> sexist but loving husband routine i especially <UNK> the scene in which <UNK> joins her husband and male friend in some man to man banter over a bottle of beer to her husband's macho embarrassment and <UNK> according to this movie it isn't a woman's place to take part in a man's conversations ah but our <UNK> free spirit is too good for this place and doesn't understand the oppressive <UNK> rules of <UNK> not only does this scene depict something so fake it should be enough on its own to <UNK> the entire movie's credibility it also completely gets the wrong end of the stick of the culture it <UNK> to depict clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population i would challenge anyone who knows contemporary italy to say otherwise br br for a truly accomplished contemporary italian filmmaker one who in my opinion deserves to be listed among the <UNK> of <UNK> glorious cinematic past which alas isn't the shadow of its former self look no further than <UNK> especially and his latest la stella che non unlike most contemporary italian cinema sadly derivative and <UNK> is a fresh and <UNK> creative voice despite my <UNK> review of i am now more than willing to believe that latest now showing in italian cinemas will be a worthwhile one i therefore look <UNK> to enjoying it though it won't be overly shocking to me if i don't considering my feelings for
<START> this <UNK> perverse and oddball early 80's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent <UNK> of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous <UNK> movie devil times five but it's still an above average killer kid <UNK> nonetheless br br the slim but <UNK> plot centers on a trio of <UNK> <UNK> two <UNK> boys and one <UNK> <UNK> eyed albeit <UNK> looking little girl who are all born during a <UNK> <UNK> on june <UNK> 1970 when the strange <UNK> trio who stick together in a tightly self contained and <UNK> circle reach ten years of age they suddenly go <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> open season on the hapless unsuspecting local <UNK> of the <UNK> sleepy and peaceful california <UNK> of <UNK> writer director ed hunt the usually incompetent <UNK> hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched <UNK> as the delightfully dopey starship <UNK> the <UNK> inane jesus christ vigilante <UNK> alien warrior and the stunningly silly the brain does a pretty solid and capable job here the kill scenes are <UNK> and reasonably brutal the arrow through the eye gag is especially nasty there's a <UNK> <UNK> of gratuitous nudity and soft core sex a <UNK> amount of tension is neatly created and <UNK> some nice <UNK> of dark humor <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> mayhem and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly <UNK> br br moreover the top <UNK> cast further <UNK> the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing jose as a small town doctor future jake and the tv series star joe penny as an amateur the prey 's <UNK> as the <UNK> babysitter heroine susan <UNK> as a bitchy school teacher american ninja 's michael <UNK> as a jock and <UNK> <UNK> the lonely <UNK> vampire in the <UNK> melancholy dance of the damned as a <UNK> teen dude who gets <UNK> while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a <UNK> van billy <UNK> who went on to star in such late 80's direct to video <UNK> as dr alien and andy freeman and especially the <UNK> adorable elizabeth <UNK> are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible of <UNK> evil and amoral <UNK> and yes that's none other than julie brown the <UNK> <UNK> who scored a surprise top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune the <UNK> <UNK> gotta gun as the lovely vacuous full <UNK> <UNK> bimbo who does a great lengthy totally <UNK> yet still <UNK> and much appreciated nude <UNK> while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy <UNK> rock song all in all this baby <UNK> up as a <UNK> and satisfying slasher item
<START> as a kid i grew up with the <UNK> 60's tv series and no i'm not that <UNK> however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from <UNK> his <UNK> over the much hyped latest <UNK> <UNK> and 'the dark which i don't really care for even if they're going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce wayne batman psyche but in honesty i don't think there's all that much to tap in to i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that's what burton brought across and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again br br after <UNK> audiences with the 1989 <UNK> thanks to the gothic art direction and jack nicholson take no prisoners performance of the <UNK> up but psychotic joker burton would return 3 years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far <UNK> camp but well done in what would fair up to being even more <UNK> <UNK> dreary and <UNK> and having two villainous <UNK> for the price of one enter the grotesque penguin with danny <UNK> <UNK> going out on a <UNK> and the ravishing <UNK> a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely coming to spoil party again batman an <UNK> brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite <UNK> in that bat look at the eyes plays second <UNK> to the bad guys but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an <UNK> gloomy <UNK> but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too <UNK> atmospheric direction opens with his <UNK> gothic style an carnival comic book world <UNK> in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes the moody narrative in what probably is a tad too long is more so symbolic in its progression rather show <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> set pieces and <UNK> <UNK> art direction covered with shadowy <UNK> and grey blue <UNK> lighting of a <UNK> backdrop the <UNK> free flowing camera work takes flight and danny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> score <UNK> the <UNK> along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull the rest of the performances might be overshadowed but christopher walken <UNK> in his teeth into a <UNK> role of a two faced businessman max pat <UNK> is back but gets very little to do as <UNK> james gordon and michael <UNK> is delightful as alfred in solid support are michael murphy andrew vincent <UNK> doug jones and peter <UNK> also makes a cameo appearance
<START> the key scene in <UNK> <UNK> nine lives comes when sissy <UNK> hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with <UNK> quinn find a nature documentary on television at which point quinn notes the <UNK> of such things <UNK> footage is edited into one scene <UNK> and <UNK> are thrown together in order to capture the moment all to force connections where none actually exist characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally <UNK> over into each others stories but none of them ever seem to really connect a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later <UNK> with his current wife a dinner party for an unhappy couple garcia <UNK> some of his characters in front of each other but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before br br <UNK> first film the wonderful overlooked things you can tell just by looking at her also had a short story structure and <UNK> characters but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow the <UNK> premise of nine lives that each of its nine stories is told in a single <UNK> take in real time never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum it's also a fairly visually ugly movie interior shots are often murky and hard to watch while other scenes particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her <UNK> parents are rendered annoying by the camera work given that this is <UNK> third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish like fellow filmmaker child of a great writer rebecca miller garcia son of gabriel garcia <UNK> is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the <UNK> of the film making ones br br individual scenes are touching and even affecting i did like jason kissing robin wright <UNK> pregnant belly and joe <UNK> <UNK> lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre surgery <UNK> and sissy <UNK> stealing a few happy moments away from her life with <UNK> quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter but the film unlike things you can tell just by looking at her feels more like an exercise than actual drama we are just watching people act
<START> this is a relatively watchable movie 1 after watching ultimate killing machine this one looks good in comparison there are no obvious technical <UNK> although the <UNK> teeth look odd br br the story line makes no sense let's see an american <UNK> fights vampires comes back to the states and is <UNK> for seeing vampires his commanding officer is the aunt of his ex wife who happens to be doing some research on the of the south american area where the vampires are huh don't pile on too many <UNK> who cares about the head vampire or his daughter or any one in this film the only originality in this is that most of the <UNK> about vampires <UNK> to crosses and <UNK> can't come out in the day etc are wrong but they can't be killed except by <UNK> or a wood wound in the heart yeah right it's obvious they just didn't want to film a dark movie since this is a made for tv film br br it would have been nice for the viewer if they had hired some actors oh they've got <UNK> carter tv's wonder woman and a big black dude with a tremendously deep voice who <UNK> appropriately in order to show off his vampire teeth <UNK> but otherwise you would never know they had actually paid people to read these lines br br there is more than enough fight scenes and some vampire biting neck blood but no real violence
<START> a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue the anti hero the man builds a <UNK> to escape a band of <UNK> out of the of what was once a civilization to the ruins of the city to for his survival there he crosses with the <UNK> brilliantly played by jean reno of the professional and mission impossible fame the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a <UNK> of his own design by using their wits the man and the old genius are able to keep the <UNK> and his <UNK> at bay but they realise it is only a matter of time before their <UNK> are <UNK> so they make a break for it this is a strongly understated tale of the <UNK> struggle for life with excellent action scenes and clever humor of all of the movies of its kind like road warrior <UNK> man and even ultimate warrior featuring <UNK> as a buff knife fighter le <UNK> combat is the most <UNK> crafted copies of the video are hard to find i would give my left eye ball for one if your local art house ever has a revival of this film i <UNK> recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big
<START> i have to say its not very good polly <UNK> is fine in this film the rest are so so i'm gay and honestly there are so many <UNK> for this time in history that its just sad we started watching it then turned it off then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film but all said the basic idea of the film is good if it was re written with less contrived lines and better acting it could have actually been <UNK> good over all i would not recommend it in the this is <UNK> <UNK> thinking line is so lame on top of that the fight in the hair <UNK> is funny because its so bad the lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it on is so weird its sad
<START> if you're a fan of the original ten <UNK> this movie will make you <UNK> inside granted i'm only about 1 2 hour into it currently but it's so painful i felt it was my duty to warn away real ten <UNK> fans before they are subjected to this <UNK> i didn't think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in 1950s when the original was shot but this 2006 remake proves me wrong i can forgive some lame special effects but the <UNK> dialogue melodramatic lifetime movie style <UNK> and the stilted we are wax figures come to life acting makes me hope they'll rewrite the plot and <UNK> <UNK> in the red sea
<START> oh what the heck i'll reveal the secret this movie stinks br br yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that for their time were probably really exciting to watch now they don't cut it but they're not terrible they're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it so they just sit there and i sit watching this not laughing not excited just well bored it stinks br br if i can exercise my jay <UNK> for a moment the film really does the box promises <UNK> versus dinosaurs and in very generic sense it delivers guys dressed like <UNK> fight a couple of big dinosaurs but really these guys are a bunch of <UNK> and the hero is a loser more on this later and the dinosaurs are hardly <UNK> the plot is a <UNK> and there isn't much technically wrong with it that's there to laugh at it's all just gray and bland br br after some dreadful night cinematography filmed in one and a half colors i called it we get the plot which involves some people doing stuff that was what i caught oh and they are at the turn of the century in mexico so they at least dress like <UNK> even if they don't act like it br br so a bunch of these people who i think were human they go in the desert and they stumble on these dinosaurs after they find a <UNK> horse i don't know let's just move on then the movie <UNK> into a really pathetic king kong ripoff in the final act at that point i had lost the will to even keep my eyes at television level and i <UNK> in and out of consciousness br br the hero is played by the guy from beneath the planet of the apes who essentially played charlton <UNK> part when heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel he was picked cause shock <UNK> shocks he looks exactly like heston that's about all he has going for him i was really upset when he was the hero of the film cause all he does is <UNK> bag the chick in the film who's named t j unfortunately she's not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs saves the day numerous times and what does he get for it not recognition no nothing and he dies <UNK> himself for his friends they don't even wait up for him while they escape br br boring long slowly paced with little to enjoy until the film decides to <UNK> copy king <UNK> script onto it's own it's best to avoid this film unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an <UNK> on your <UNK>
<START> if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood <UNK> i'm sure it would sound like this br br me four boys at a private high school are good friends and they are witches br br hollywood that sounds like the craft br br me no no i said four boys not four girls br br hollywood that still sounds like the craft just with boys instead of girls br br me ok but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power br br hollywood still not much difference because one of the girls in the craft also wanted more power br br me ok ok i'll make these boys part of the in crowd they'll be rich and the school is on the east coast br br hollywood now that sounds original that is nothing like the craft here's a billion dollars br br this movie was so cliché and uninspiring even the <UNK> drama between chase and the brothers of was very <UNK> a bunch of rich kids with their biggest problem being what color <UNK> they want for their 18th birthday and 18th car don't interest me at all even if they have powers every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80 nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are i wanted to <UNK> this movie the witches of o c <UNK> rich kids and their problems let me pretend to care br br this film was completely unimaginative and predictable the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti climatic this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor
<START> oh yes i admit i have made myself guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of trash i can't say i was forced by aliens who pointed a gun at my head tied me to a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned this awful excuse for a movie on no i did it with free will i deliberately tortured myself let's go through the fact here folks the acting is an insult to humanity the plot if it exists is ridiculous the character development is horrendous the characters that appear in the movie are so clichéd you would br br recognize them in your average comic book the editing is sloppy and unimaginative the camera work is low key the dialogue is simply the worst in cinematic history the directing well let's say i bet it wasn't hitchcock br br then to add to these facts there was absolutely no talent involved <UNK> so ever the director must be smoking crack now to forgive himself for <UNK> this poison to the world br br bottom line <UNK> to paris is one of the worst movies ever made permanent
<START> this movie is a nonsense spoof comedy in the lines of the airplane or naked gun but it doesn't even come close to this two because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes rather then just throwing you with the same old easy jokes br br you can figure out some references to other movies from the top of my head i identified <UNK> and rocky so you can have some fun with that trying to find out what movies are <UNK> br br the movie also offers you an occasional laugh but nothing that can cause you <UNK> thus nothing really funny br br i liked the character <UNK> in some ways even though some of the jokes with him are standard comedy 101 br br i think this movie and like most of nonsense spoof comedy depends on the mood you are in so if you think you will laugh to any joke watch this movie if you are in a serious mood forget about this re watch the airplane instead it will definitely make you laugh
<START> skip all the <UNK> this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the <UNK> which includes both versions of this flick which i'll <UNK> to the tune of sci fi score by george <UNK> the camera goes on a <UNK> through b movie hell all photographed by will thompson who did <UNK> 9 from outer <UNK> <UNK> you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like self produced b or c grade noir wannabe actors and effects with <UNK> of <UNK> this could be for you otherwise get a copy of a modern low budget <UNK> masterpiece
<START> this movie is an <UNK> piece from terminator to <UNK> br br stan winston did the br br in this film a scientist working in a sinister <UNK> company with a really creepy boss they always are gets is killed by them in a horrible lab explosion and has his brain placed inside an <UNK> robot body br br the rest of this movie goes on with a romance angle as this cyborg man <UNK> consciousness and <UNK> havoc while trying to communicate with his wife played by the gorgeous back then in 1986 <UNK> austin he tries to <UNK> with his old life like in that scene in <UNK> br br the rest of this movie is about breaking things while trying to defeat the evil his evil boss from <UNK> him for some ill defined humans into project br br this film pays homage to previous movies like the day the earth stood still as the cyborg breaks free like the giant robot does br br except for the <UNK> designed by stan winston this movie's production values are typically canadian sleazy br br pam <UNK> stars in this film as an hired killer <UNK> a cheap role of the likes she was doing so much of during the 80's br br as for a sci fi horror b movie out of 4 stars this film ranks about a 3
<START> the thing is a <UNK> in movie making and remains one of my favourite films of all time despite the film's roots in science fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly <UNK> splatter with psychological trauma today over twenty five years after its release the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob <UNK> suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paul walker type br br an all male american science team in <UNK> are thrown into turmoil when an alien able to perfectly <UNK> and imitate other <UNK> <UNK> their camp their trust in each other <UNK> <UNK> as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation and this <UNK> scenario sees their numbers <UNK> <UNK> as one by one they fall victim to the thing when <UNK> it <UNK> itself as a different nightmarish creature the <UNK> always horrific and compelling br br the <UNK> isolation and <UNK> of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly <UNK> the long hours of darkness and the <UNK> provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play whether it be the young and street wise chef the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot the point is that no one here comes close to being an all american <UNK> superhero with blonde locks and a six pack and the film's real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism the people suffering on screen are <UNK> in our daily lives br br the thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my <UNK> at the quality of the direction the acting and the special effects is <UNK> my girlfriend prefers the high school spin off of the film the <UNK> which is good and solid entertainment but far more light hearted and she still loves and <UNK> the brilliance of the thing however and thank goodness for that because i could not remain in the company of someone who didn't love this movie br br a classic and then some
<START> the <UNK> warned about media heroes outside the movies most heroes are also ordinary people society demands some role playing but what happens when that <UNK> to the parent child relationship do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa how do you provide a role model but not a role a brilliant <UNK> who hates to swim a brilliant musician who won't play offbeat funny despite depiction of serious problems very good multi dimensional acting by everyone lots of plot twists <UNK> the emotional tension celluloid heroes never feel any pain i don't recall ever being disappointed in a <UNK> weaver film i even liked the village
<START> this show came to canada via <UNK> in the mid 90s and i really really loved it then even 10 <UNK> later watching the various news networks i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various show <UNK> we all see on tv as depicted in various <UNK> episodes the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is <UNK> by an idiotic laugh track there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don't need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at i don't understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem i was really excited to see the dvds available even though they are pal format i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files i took a chance and ordered it from 6 to 8 weeks later i had all 3 seasons even better it worked on my <UNK> dvd player i suspect any player bought in the past 2 <UNK> that does <UNK> <UNK> will play them great stuff 10 <UNK> later the episodes all hold up really well you don't need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences my wife and i had a 10 day <UNK> fest and are still <UNK> weeks later after watching all <UNK> episodes
<START> the beginning was decent the ending was alright br br sadly this movie suffers from complete and utter <UNK> of the characters unrealistic <UNK> fight scenes lack of anyone intelligent outside of the <UNK> this makes for an awful middle screenplay br br stuff to look for overly obvious <UNK> fast healing cuts overly <UNK> fires fun <UNK> reactions br br i did give it a 4 not a 0 because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development the relationship between the main dark haired girl and her fiancée is touched upon briefly and the placement of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present though <UNK> so the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and <UNK> done though as another <UNK> pointed out not unexpected br br <UNK>
<START> not to be confused with michael <UNK> nasty 1975 beauty <UNK> spoof this smile is a down turned example of those good intentions <UNK> the road to hell br br the film parallels two stories an <UNK> chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a <UNK> <UNK> orphan named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a tv <UNK> <UNK> family act out <UNK> get birth control katie the third olsen twin plays a spoiled self absorbed high <UNK> <UNK> from reality her teacher sean <UNK> <UNK> the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with <UNK> children br br the film uses <UNK> as a means of suspense by treating <UNK> like the frankenstein monster kramer continually masks her <UNK> through hats <UNK> and camera placement this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and <UNK> answer is to cover her up until the big reveal why <UNK> your audience with such <UNK> we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing credit <UNK> of her after surgery <UNK> a <UNK> beneath the it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live what is <UNK> is <UNK> being equally as hot and popular as katie br br funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and <UNK> evans they <UNK> a <UNK> of quality family films give me son of <UNK> any day
<START> this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into <UNK> with imdb so that i could vote for and comment on it i've only recently come to appreciate well produced war movies and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen br br stunning is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time it is gently moving yet exciting at the same time not a <UNK> this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy action packed top gun time <UNK> br br the two lead actors playing <UNK> and <UNK> played off of each other <UNK> well and is a very pretty boy without seeming to <UNK> or exploit that fact in terms of acting ability and appearance my husband said tongue in cheek well he's no tom cruise i <UNK> thank god if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting see this one
<START> <UNK> <UNK> br br great message great symbolism very good movie br br it's hard to go totally wrong with robert mitchum robert young and robert ryan all together as the three male leads and with director edward pulling together a complicated murder and detective yarn that's reason enough to watch it once and even twice br br you might need a second look to fully catch the plot as it is explained too much or shown in flashback also too much because it's a little complicated without good reason but it makes sense overall and we see early on too early probably who the <UNK> is and even why br br besides the drama well done in typical noir lighting and filled with those short <UNK> that make post war films dramatic there is the social message the anti anti <UNK> point of it all it only borders on preachy once or twice and it's such an obviously good point to make we watch it being made and wait for the plot and the dramatic acting to take front row which they do especially young who is a brilliantly <UNK> and patient detective and ryan who is mean in a <UNK> crude and angry way ryan is good at that his <UNK> reasonable mitchum mostly plays a watered down version of what he is famous for and the fourth known acting force gloria <UNK> is a great brief presence even if slightly <UNK> br br though the movie is dominated by the sequence of events and by the message both of which grow in force as we go it is really easy to watch just for the lighting camera work and acting including the classic fight scene that opens the first few seconds of the film all done with shadows br br the <UNK> of soldiers presented is very deliberate and this might be something people at the time were very familiar with and could relate to as much as the anti <UNK> thread the shell shocked soldier rendered helpless but still <UNK> capable the modest <UNK> without confidence but capable too and the weary but <UNK> able veteran are all there and of course the angry violent soldier who is a product of the war too this last is also a responsibility of society even the army goes all out to make good on the <UNK> here not just because they are criminal but because they <UNK> from the wear and tear of a long awful war br br the audience then more than now could really get but it's there to appreciate still
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br mr bean <UNK> <UNK> is in this world but not of this world his mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this getting himself into constant <UNK> and far out zany situations which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks but he never gives up and despite the <UNK> of tasks being a constant struggle for him <UNK> his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end br br to look at the sorry state of modern british humour with all it's focus of sex and general <UNK> you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like mr bean was made at one time there's nothing <UNK> going on here just good clean u rated humour of the type tommy cooper and the like made in the 50s and i find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early <UNK> as i did when i was a young boy in the early 90s br br although i can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye there must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him as others have noted it looks like he may have a type of <UNK> in fact i'm so convinced about it that i really think were a professional psychologist to <UNK> him i think mr bean could be the first famous fictional character to be <UNK> with something like syndrome br br if you'd like to see some truly hilarious british humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and <UNK> then this would come highly recommended shows like little britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest shows like this show we were more restrained and <UNK> once and hopefully we might start putting out this type of humour more again sometime soon
<START> the one and the only br br the only really good description of the punk movement in the la in the early 80's also the definitive documentary about legendary bands like the black flag and the x mainstream <UNK> <UNK> views about this film are absolutely hilarious how can music be so in a country of supposed liberty even 20 years after find out br br
<START> keys to the <UNK> is <UNK> br br rob vs justin in season two br br i went to school with rob and <UNK> you may remember her as the last girl he was picking up this was when the angry girlfriend came by they made out and left the club together they were good friends at father in br br whether or not rob planned it or they asked him to do it men should know that what they are seeing is not real and the guys on here are <UNK> <UNK> especially that episode br br one more line to fill space
<START> i was at <UNK> <UNK> in toronto as a 10 year old and the event i saw then was pretty different from what i saw on the <UNK> collection dvd i just watched i don't understand how the wwe doesn't have the rights to some of the old music since most of those songs were created by the <UNK> they shouldn't have to worry about the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that prevent shows like snl from releasing season sets its pretty stupid to <UNK> about but for me hearing <UNK> come out to their theme music at a <UNK> in person was a memory that i never forgot and it didn't exist on this dvd what is the point of them even <UNK> the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it
<START> my take routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists br br a rarely seen political thriller which made a very poor box office response i managed to catch the shadow conspiracy on tv just now and while i was glad that i satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film i didn't exactly feel this film was all special considering the box office response to it shadow conspiracy is not all quite as bad as critics and the public <UNK> to it but still ain't very good to begin with and everything from script to direction is pretty predictable charlie sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with <UNK> and chases a lot of them when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which <UNK> amongst the white house staff after a professor is murdered sheen aids the help of ex flame reporter amanda <UNK> linda hamilton to <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> the conspiracy of the title br br but this script written by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are pedestrian as they come not much <UNK> from other white house conspiracy thrillers as in absolute power and murder at <UNK> some considerable talents donald sutherland ben <UNK> and stephen lang try their best on a routine script but rarely saves it from predictability of the script not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter which seems far too silly and out of place in this serious political thriller the shadow conspiracy has its moments i'm sure some of which are much to under appreciated director george pan <UNK> serves up some decent chase scenes but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises br br rating out of 5
<START> <UNK> terrible terrible terrible terrible did i mention terrible you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me well someone brought this home for me to watch and when i looked at it i just wanted to <UNK> the person because they used my money i will certainly be taking it back soon but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory for i definitely want to forget it this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible it's beyond horrible quite possibly the worst film ever the acting was so so so so <UNK> disgusting as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was which kind of <UNK> me a little don't see this film shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page because you think this will be decent final word <UNK>
<START> well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws i didn't believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist also <UNK> character seemed to recover from <UNK> depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous however the film does succeed due to a good pace humor and its stars matthau may not have been a dentist but he was as amusing as he usually is bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work and also a good deal of humor i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after <UNK> a couple scenes <UNK> performance is noteworthy although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit basically don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself
<START> i wish that all the <UNK> and horror spoofs would go away if you are going to investigate <UNK> <UNK> do it for real enough of the bull same with horror and sci fi if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary make it scary not funny i hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life or running or whatever their life is at stake and they are cracking jokes this never happens <UNK> where have all the good directors gone i think horror and sci fi have really gone down the tube since the 70's i long for the days that a horror flick was scary all this scary movie crap is for the birds this film is also for the birds if you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk don't expect it in this video
<START> just watched this movie and it's not bad there are a few tense moments and not a lot of long dialog strings comes off as fairly intelligent almost like <UNK> this movie will evoke some nostalgia and a bit of cold war paranoia with cars street scenes and life in the 50's the acting is fairly solid and at 85 minutes run time it goes by at a good pace an atomic era film buff shouldn't miss this one
<START> for late 80s cheese this really isn't so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand <UNK> thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for <UNK> as well as oscars i'm curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after who's that girl
<START> i saw this film right in the middle while going through a <UNK> it was about 3 in the morning and i was battling insomnia with a quick <UNK> it wasn't too bad at the time but every time i have tried to watch it since i can't get into it like i did that night br br at the time i thought it was cute and i loved the variety of characters though they totally could have done better than <UNK> v in my opinion but the one thing that kept me watching was <UNK> character and her sad commitment to her husband who didn't want her anymore which made me feel sorry for her and root for her at the same time considering i was in a similar situation at the time perhaps that's why i liked her so much not a bad film but you pretty much have to be somewhere near the character <UNK> in order to appreciate it and let's hope you never are
<START> following a <UNK> incident at new <UNK> grand central station an innocent <UNK> kevin spacey the usual suspects is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of <UNK> drugs we can understand why they think this considering how the man <UNK> informed them that he wears his dark glasses because the light on your planet is really bright and so as he <UNK> himself <UNK> as <UNK> with goat is <UNK> off to the psychiatric <UNK> of manhattan where a weary <UNK> doctor mark powell jeff bridges the big <UNK> attempts to understand this man's so called <UNK> br br manner is <UNK> and <UNK> when asked why he believes he has been <UNK> he matter of <UNK> replies that it is because you think i'm crazy within minutes after satisfying his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for earth fruit the completely <UNK> has revealed that he is an <UNK> from the planet k <UNK> which <UNK> 1000 light years away <UNK> the star system <UNK> and located in the <UNK> he also details how his infinitely more advanced species has already <UNK> faster than light travel through <UNK> the energy of light an accomplishment that is allegedly <UNK> away for the human race br br powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims though he is nevertheless fascinated by them and commits himself to understanding how came to believe such a thing meanwhile uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward eventually offering everybody around him something to live for and hope of a cure on july 27 later reveals he will <UNK> again for k <UNK> and he can only take one human with him of what will actually happen on that date nobody is certain br br originally <UNK> to play dr powell  with will smith as  kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to <UNK> from the film you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character the completely matter of fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue your produce alone has been worth the trip often <UNK> genuine laughter there is <UNK> intelligence behind many of words but logic maintains that he must be <UNK> <UNK> he br br the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities  for the first segment of the film we almost accept the possibility that is an <UNK> this is a sci fi movie isn't it before being totally convinced when inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the <UNK> of a newly discovered planet system a final investigation by dr powell offers us a neatly <UNK> <UNK> explanation for <UNK> but this is just as quickly <UNK> away and we are left scratching our heads again the film quite rightly keeps its ending open leaving the audience to contemplate what they've just watched and to discuss it with those around them nevertheless whether you believe to be an alien or not two irresistible <UNK> in your mind the universe is indeed a fascinating place and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover
<START> i wonder why i haven't heard of this movie before it's truly a magnificent comedy i'd say farce but it's too well acted and i'd hate to <UNK> it's quality a comedic character study about the <UNK> of mid life <UNK> the <UNK> for gays who can't have their long time <UNK> recognized and the general differences of people who can't fit nicely into society that <UNK> kathy bates and rupert everett to a wonderful effect forget julia roberts and rupert kathy bates and rupert should do another movie together the anxiety ridden <UNK> and outrageous daughter in law meredith <UNK> is a truly wonderful character if you liked the tales of the city films you'd like this quirky <UNK>
<START> oh boy my god what a movie this one this is probably the best movie by sean austin and louis jr i have seen all the comment for this movie and most of them loves this movie very much but i don't really understand why it only got 6 1 in imdb list this one should above 7 5 the plot and the script are completely perfect the acting are superbly well acted sean austin will <UNK> louis jr have given an incredible and awesome performance in their career this movie contain a lot of action br br just one thing i gotta say watch it br br 10 out of 10 stars
<START> don't let any reviews critics imdb users or mine influence you seeing this movie i read only the plot premise and became intrigued after watching this movie in my opinion is definitely worth seeing it gives a perspective on life that many have probably not <UNK> its is not however as <UNK> himself says a movie that can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not <UNK> quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie which is disappointing to say the least br br in short it is a well acted well directed movie the story is not a feel good one but i feel if you don't come away from the movie feeling good you may just have missed something to <UNK> it as art house is unfair in my opinion but as our society likes <UNK> this is probably the one that fits if you find you know everything there is to know about the world i'd suggest skipping this one if you feel movies should be a form of escape from the world you won't find it here but if you do watch it you just might find something in yourself
<START> it's a long time ago i saw this movie and still it's one of the worst i've ever seen i like lots of kind of movies sci fi action drama thrillers and sometimes even horror not a combination of two this could have been a wonderful movie but they all blew it up i didn't want to see this movie but friends of mine insisted to watch it i didn't know it was such a crap i loved the first part in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas killing everybody on their way especially the scene with the <UNK> shooting was excellent but at its turning point in the <UNK> <UNK> bar everything changed stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like <UNK> on if you like horror watch a real horror movie and when you love thrillers don't watch it at all you will be very disappointed at the end
<START> i loved this movie it was <UNK> touching and funny finally here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges <UNK> a bit and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for when was the last time you saw that in a film dealing with the <UNK> of life love and sexuality the characters are faced with real problems albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip and the explicit <UNK> and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy darkly desperate or too unrealistic you'll love and care about the characters who far from being hollow stereotypes portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would be <UNK> br br a good <UNK> for a saturday afternoon and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual <UNK> ends happily and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be far better than kissing jessica <UNK> a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson or maybe you just like a good british romp james <UNK> looks dashing as always and tom <UNK> is deliciously funny so go forth watch enjoy you won't regret it
<START> logan <UNK> dean collins iii of jack bobby fame provide a nice touch of <UNK> as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie logan <UNK> may be seemingly <UNK> in roles of being different as <UNK> seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby the movie also opens up with a very nice tune <UNK> as a lost 45 and i'm wondering where the lions are a song which i'd always heard on the <UNK> my old job of and got it played on my local radio show of the <UNK> by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out <UNK> <UNK> is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground <UNK> as seen in this movie too what a hoot too this movie is hoot a hoot in the tradition of the owl commercials of the 1970s too <UNK> stephen steve g <UNK> a k a <UNK>

<START> the creator of <UNK> <UNK> brings you a twilight zone themed tale of the <UNK> fashion the film centers on a middle aged young couple living paycheck to paycheck in 1976 one day a mysterious box appears with a red button later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die it's a disturbing and provocative question <UNK> <UNK> in the trailer and tv spots but let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it at times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter it would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline there's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film <UNK> <UNK> there isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you it's meant to inspire lots of <UNK> <UNK> afterwards however i'd also like to say it's shot well and has an appropriately aged look to it and it's worth a watch check it out
<START> i don't understand how people could not like this movie you have jr the kid who played the main character in stand by me sean <UNK> and many other great actors lots of action and fun that you don't see in today's movies anymore it's really a shame br br this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let's get harry the 80's and early 90's created such great movies that will never again be topped by today's standards br br they tried to somehow recreate this movie in <UNK> but came up short with some really bad acting the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart but obviously that wasn't enough
<START> when wallace and <UNK> burst onto the scene in their academy award winning short a grand day out they created a fresh new look at <UNK> after two more shorts <UNK> dynamic duo returned for this thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie it has an excellent voice cast humorous jokes and good animation as only <UNK> could do br br in this movie wallace and <UNK> run anti a rabbit <UNK> company when word gets out about a were rabbit eating all the <UNK> in town a frenzy ensues of course victor <UNK> the town's handsome <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the lovely lady but can our favorite <UNK> duo save the day before chaos ensues br br the jokes i should say were hilarious one point the villain victor <UNK> crack was showing <UNK> a character to cry out beware the moon vintage <UNK> br br the characters are crisp and hilarious our favorite <UNK> team of man and dog entertains us as only they could do <UNK> them their second oscar remember a grand day out helena bonham carter was terrific as the lovely lady <UNK> love interest ralph <UNK> was especially funny and foreboding as the cunning <UNK> wearing hunter victor <UNK> but the one who really stole the show was the priest whose antics proved to be some hilarious comic relief br br hats off to <UNK> for creating another wallace and <UNK> masterpiece
<START> why has <UNK> carlos brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth that answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father what they come in contact with is in fact a <UNK> episode involving another group of six with five of them presumably meeting graphic <UNK> at the hands of a sadistic security guard paul naschy which occurred 20 some odd years ago but as they seek out a way to escape from this place terror <UNK> them as that horrifying moment in time <UNK> as the group run for their lives often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways will <UNK> and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them br br stylish spanish slasher has that professional <UNK> and potent shocking violence to match some witty <UNK> between the characters layered in their dialogue are pop culture references to american horror films which might annoy some viewers a demented naschy is really <UNK> with the <UNK> as he attacks them <UNK> quite a <UNK> maniac who carries out his violent acts with <UNK> i found the loud musical <UNK> a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as <UNK> to the audience i don't think these tricks are necessarily needed but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of <UNK> and flashbacks a minor <UNK> for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the <UNK> supernatural aspects of the plot moments in time <UNK> and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave the twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt but this might or might not work considering how the story plays out regarding why father is shown amongst those ghosts re <UNK> those grisly events two decades prior i will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if <UNK> in detail but as a slasher flick it's a breath of fresh air
<START> this working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate courtesy of its <UNK> physical production 50s <UNK> look at all those <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> johnny <UNK> theme song and oh so daring for its time sexual attitudes <UNK> <UNK> novel on which the film was based keeps on being and just a few years ago vanity fair actually devoted an article to this <UNK> bon bon of a movie take a look at the new dvd transfer and you'll know why br br the three leads hope lange diane baker and <UNK> parker echo the girls from how to marry a or carrie <UNK> and her friends from sex and the city off on a spree their romantic adventures and sexual <UNK> are the stuff of <UNK> passion empty <UNK> corn devoid of <UNK> impossible to resist <UNK> on lange is genuinely touching in her neo grace kelly way baker is properly dim and idealistic as a <UNK> virgin who gets gasp knocked up by a <UNK> <UNK> it helps that the <UNK> is played by robert evans the <UNK> voiced coke <UNK> film <UNK> who surely has lead many an innocent young <UNK> to the slaughter in his beverly hills bedroom br br <UNK> parker is fascinating in the first half of the film all <UNK> self <UNK> and knowing remarks she <UNK> her stuff with the <UNK> of the fashion icon she was in the 50s alas she's not up to where the film sends her into madness and obsession but she exudes <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and her acting is at least adequate one wonders why the critics <UNK> her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later perhaps an <UNK> attitude on the part of a good looking woman is just too much to bear it <UNK> ali <UNK> career a generation later and when you think of it ali <UNK> and <UNK> parker were basically the same actress br br the film's only major flaw is a weak ending it pretty much <UNK> into a romantic <UNK> at the end rather than rising to a <UNK> bang melodramatic finish like the other famous soap opera from producer jerry <UNK> <UNK> place which had <UNK> turner <UNK> and <UNK> her teeth during a rape trial here hope lange wanders out onto the new york sidewalk spots <UNK> <UNK> hung over but now of course sober stephen <UNK> and they simply walk off together into the sunset one <UNK> otherwise this is pretty much the definition of a guilty pleasure br br oh yes there's also joan crawford breathing fire at all the young girls and smoking <UNK> while she <UNK> to her married lover over the phone and the titles are done in hot pink with <UNK> <UNK> that recalls the department store ads of the late 50s don't miss
<START> i love the premise but it's replay value is only for certain parts the opening scene of course some characters are a bit outrageous but they are entertaining none the less i think the sh t was pushing it i know it was to show that nick and <UNK> were living foul out in la and to show why <UNK> quit the lifestyle i just think that the story could have been better also the <UNK> guy <UNK> on the phone is clever and entertaining but once again i think the story was told sloppy it really seems unbelievable i actually believe <UNK> the other movie woods has written more than some of the parts in <UNK> because the government keeps sh t a secret all the time and has <UNK> set up that the public will never know about br br <UNK> is the best movie i've seen i think woods is imaginative clever and has <UNK> however his work needs more <UNK> to even to get to the natural born killer script not <UNK> movie level how old is he anyway
<START> this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film it's just plain bad the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows it is flat unfunny and boring br br it is clear that the <UNK> ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop br br bad editing bad music bad acting zero <UNK> <UNK> chemistry br br a film that doesn't know what it is made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted br br the <UNK> obviously were made an offer they couldn't refuse or perhaps their <UNK> have simply got the better of them it's a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the <UNK> were <UNK> and more inspired br br i however did know when to stop and did br br please someone try to convince me of this film's <UNK> points
<START> so many great talents were <UNK> in the best years of out lives the result has to be somewhat <UNK> think of what its director william <UNK> faced in the aftermath of a military victory over powers who had committed <UNK> crimes and <UNK> the world if battles he was making a film that <UNK> that the <UNK> leaders were themselves profoundly anti individual that they had wasted the best years of the lives of those <UNK> or <UNK> into fighting the war which since it ignored the rights of individuals had been for nothing except argument over the degree of slavery men were to exist under there are beautiful sets by julia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cinematography and a script by robert e <UNK> author of the road to rome and other <UNK> of individuals against <UNK> ideas the ironic title was used to draw the talents of actors such as <UNK> march myrna loy <UNK> wright dana andrews virginia <UNK> cathy <UNK> and <UNK> into a large scale but <UNK> drama the clever plot line was the experiences of <UNK> couples after the soldiers three being <UNK> tried to return home to a culture their bitter experiences and their realization of their own need to fight again against what was happening on the <UNK> poses a strong and <UNK> <UNK> to the conventional notion being sold that all was well with america march and his wife have a terrible time <UNK> and he is drinking <UNK> young man harold russell has <UNK> instead of hands and wonders if life can even be worth living and worst of all <UNK> wife throws him over for a guy with <UNK> and he has lost years causing <UNK> to ignore or deny his rights to a job to consideration on his individual merits to have even what he had before he had been ripped from his life and thrust into the <UNK> of risk for nothing and loss of everything he had ever had the shattering climax of the film comes when each of the three has to confront the need to do battle again each for his own happiness and all three succeed in finding the courage to go on fighting each for his own happiness which is now being threatened by a curiously anti self anti reality indifferent an un american united states <UNK> direction especially of the scene where andrews sits in the <UNK> of a <UNK> b 17 alone and the scene of <UNK> wedding is wonderful indeed this is a most powerful film and a great one on its own terms one women and men can agree on for once music by hugo and costumes by irene <UNK> add to its <UNK> one of the best and most unexpected films of all time in stunning b w
<START> this <UNK> contains <UNK> like touches but doesn't sustain one's interest a 10 year old <UNK> a <UNK> america in a stolen <UNK> while the usual cult movie suspects dick miller mary <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> commit <UNK> acts in the name of comedy like his after hours and <UNK> kiss the screenwriter <UNK> in making you <UNK> i remained <UNK> due to the broad acting you know you're in for it when meat <UNK> and flea give the most appealing and what did this kid's screen test look like he's <UNK> recommended to the dozen or so fans of sonny boy <UNK>
<START> a trash classic basically what we have here is a story about a couple of american teenagers one male one female both beautiful people of course who seem to be <UNK> linked in that every time both of them fall asleep they can inhabit each others dreams and express each others <UNK> desires think mills <UNK> meets x files and you'll be somewhere near the mark actually its more like an unhappy hybrid between one of ed <UNK> <UNK> bad b movies and a particularly silly episode of <UNK> place so tacky are the special effects and so amateurish is the acting the actors who inhabit i wouldn't say act in this flick say their lines like they're reading from cue cards and <UNK> when they're supposed to be showing an emotion and it comes as no great shock or loss to the industry that they have since faded into obscurity the whole thing is just a laughably misguided mixture of styles that don't go together at all and the end result is a intriguing curiosity that no doubt will be <UNK> up by <UNK> of so bad they're good films in years to come i'll probably be the only person who ever comments on this film but if you are reading and have seen it please get back it gets kinda lonely round here
<START> the movie is not <UNK> as bad as people want to make you believe it is br br what is the reason why so many people hate this movie is it because it's laurel <UNK> last one together and it's not their best or is it because of the lack of laurel hardy <UNK> or because it's not made by the hal roach studios or 20th century fox br br definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive laurel hardy and bring them to the <UNK> it's also definitely true that the movie is far from their best but honestly the movie still entertains well making this movie also far from their worst not the most worthy <UNK> movie imaginable but an entertaining and <UNK> goodbye nevertheless both of them retired from movies after <UNK> this one br br the movie still features some great slapstick moments and the chemistry between laurel hardy is obviously still very much present it also makes this movie better than most of their movies together from the <UNK> quite a surprise that the slapstick humor still works out as great as it does considering that the days of slapstick comedy had been over ever since the <UNK> br br the story is perhaps not as entertaining as it could had been and it features too many <UNK> and characters with as a result that the movie <UNK> its focus on the boys at times a shame because they are still the ones that really carry and make the movie br br sad to see in what poor form stan laurel was at the time of making this movie he really looked ill and old which he also of course was he was well over 60 years old already but after a surgery he fully <UNK> and still lived for another 15 years before dying in 1965 8 years after his good friend oliver hardy br br an entertaining though not perfect goodbye to the boys laurel hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun humorous quality slapstick entertainment of movies that are still being watched and loved by people all over the world br br 7 10
<START> okay that was just brilliant i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong it really needed more episodes like this br br the cast worked perfectly even though they were all <UNK> back in the day writing was fantastic and so was the editing great job in all accounts br br the episode was thrilling suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end which is what most episodes had tried but failed until now br br the first five star episode for me really good almost like a movie i didn't even remember it being this good i think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'the <UNK>
<START> i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour i was a little drunk and tired br br i went to bed and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep i couldn't stop thinking about why so i got up switched the tv back on loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie br br well done alex sir you've managed to <UNK> your film into this old cynical movie goers head and that takes doing so 10 out of 10 to you br br i can't say i <UNK> this film of yours but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc
<START> blue <UNK> <UNK> stars and <UNK> forever <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> surrender from the enemies which required tons and tons of radiation this was the <UNK> substance of the united states victory in world war ii the celebration on times square as well as everywhere else in the united states suggests a national <UNK> america is on top right one thing one <UNK> and <UNK> perverse thing the period of <UNK> the actual celebration ended when the bottle of <UNK> was finished now everyone needs to get on with their lives only one problem though they have to get new lives the old lives are gone forever polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile <UNK> with a <UNK> of ice <UNK> in <UNK> water everyone of the characters in the movie is <UNK> by primal doubts and unable to <UNK> a <UNK> about how nothing was seriously wrong for the simple reason that it was not true once <UNK> and <UNK> and their wives and daughters and sons and virtually all other americans touched by world war ii were exposed to <UNK> nightmares and <UNK> of world war ii and what it really accomplished as well as nobody was the same for now social and moral issues had a self serving interest <UNK> march and myrna loy had to start over dana andrews realized that he should never have been married to virginia <UNK> in the first place <UNK> wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is <UNK> selfish las but not least the character homer is about to get married and he thinks that everyone around him is as <UNK> by his injury as he is basically in the sense that they are unable or unwilling to cope br br the reason this film is so fabulous is because a happy ending was <UNK> the hard way once everybody recognized the new beginning of the new united states and the new world overall tragedy from wwii was recognized and things that were emotionally torn <UNK> were taken in <UNK> and dealt with <UNK> <UNK> march and myrna loy need to go back to chapter one in their marriage homer has <UNK> his new bride as to what it takes to be married to him i e half the times she will feel like a nurse and <UNK> involvement with dana andrews means that her entrance into <UNK> has resulted in partial responsibility for breaking up a marriage this is <UNK> to learning how to drive a car to get your <UNK> license at the <UNK> 500 the characters in the movie are the typical post wwii americans in that they are by the rude awakening of changes to their lives happiness no longer is <UNK> the luxury of the <UNK> cop aesthetic it is now about <UNK> conditions and good winning out over evil by way of the less ugly choice world war ii did not just happen it will <UNK> dominate the social <UNK> of american living br br the catastrophe of world war ii has <UNK> most <UNK> feelings of personal human <UNK> as well i loved this film and so did <UNK> probably for the reason that it brought out issues that were at one time <UNK> taboo bottom line see this movie nightmares about combat <UNK> about marital <UNK> and or <UNK> with your life when stricken ed by a <UNK> and just basically acting human are portrayed constantly in movies and television today however this is 1946 very new to americans then remember that director william <UNK> has illustrated how americans feel about the aftermath of wwii in the days when the movie industry has left him with one hand tied behind his back take that into account and you will probably realize just how sensational this movie really was
<START> okay to be fair this movie did have an interesting concept given a few script <UNK> some decent actors and a budget this might have been a fairly decent cult flick instead of the mst3k fodder it turned out to be br br still it was better than <UNK>
<START> new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this br br <UNK> of a film <UNK> attempt at speaking with a <UNK> br br accent by the way hardly anyone speaks that way in new br br orleans is terrible plot <UNK> and mindless this br br picture refers to itself as a mystery but a mystery involves a br br <UNK> process <UNK> a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film there's none of that here big br br easy tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes br br don't be fooled the real big easy is nothing like the town br br that quaid <UNK> <UNK> their way through
<START> one of the worst movies i have ever seen seagal has been acting in several entertaining action movies but this time this movie really sucks just stupid killing and really stupid storyline in addition looks fat and old
<START> this is a wonderful comedy short one of keaton's absolute best through a long series of silly mistakes buster is mistaken for a wanted killer and as a result most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular while generally i am not a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and <UNK> ability i have seen some that have had wilder stunts but none where the star was so <UNK> and able to move with amazing grace in particular there is a scene where he runs across a table jumps on a man's shoulders and <UNK> up through the as as is <UNK> possible plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone by the way this film is very similar to cops also by keaton but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing br br this film is brilliant and the only keaton short i can think of that i probably liked even more was the <UNK> where buster plays every role at the theater
<START> sequels well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous like the <UNK> which is a ship with passengers on is <UNK> on the sea and just michael caine with his and an evil telly <UNK> discover the boat well at the beginning the french marine are <UNK> above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking is a daily thing they just fly away what am i trying to say hmmm michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees <UNK> if there wasn't a telly <UNK> who is looking for weapons on the ship my god why in fact am i wasting my words on here it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts certainly not <UNK>
<START> a movie like this doesn't come along too often i'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it politicians and <UNK> <UNK> should view this before making decisions on how the destroy peoples lives i watched this the day after viewing the tv version of <UNK> about the <UNK> ghetto even with this fresh in mind i felt sympathy for the german soldier i felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen it will take awhile to <UNK> out from this one i'm surprised they have not made a movie based on the forgotten soldier by buy this movie shares the cold with the book both will haunt me for the rest of my life
<START> it is always a well known and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes in the crucial opening scenes the film should <UNK> itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film here in mute witness we find a prime example of this br br scene spoiler br br in the first 5 10 minutes the film opens to a very <UNK> scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment with the radio on she's wandering around <UNK> <UNK> herself up and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose of course the serial killer is in her house and <UNK> her moves knife in hand she hears a noise looks in a room and there is her partner in a pool of blood at the very point of her screams she turns around to be faced with the knife wielding maniac who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act br br then something odd happens as the woman in her death <UNK> the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim <UNK> before he finds his lighter his cigarette is lit from someone else in the room the camera pans out and we realise that there are more and more people in the room some taking notes some filming some recording the death and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die and making a very hammy job of it too when the audience realises what's going on and the whole scene is part of a film the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour br br end scene spoiler br br i have <UNK> this opening scene for several reasons firstly it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly a thriller in the style of hitchcock or de palma with some very and even <UNK> humorous moments it conveys a central subject matter that of the difference between a <UNK> screen <UNK> and a <UNK> film <UNK> an issue which is <UNK> on later in the film and finally it introduces the viewer to the characters all as <UNK> as possible br br the plot of mute witness <UNK> around billy hughes an american special effects make up artist who is working on the set of the film being shot in a large warehouse in <UNK> billy cannot speak but she <UNK> in sign language through her sister after the end of an <UNK> filming billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident and in her attempt to escape is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film but turns out to be a snuff movie suddenly her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death br br without doubt the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping <UNK> saving grace and her <UNK> is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound in fact in my opinion one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock full of women screaming there are some utterly disturbing moments and some superb set pieces of real suspense the and the elevator <UNK> are perfect examples the timing is fluid and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself br br the second half of the film introduces new concepts while there are still several suspenseful moments the focus is on plot twists new characters are introduced and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on while there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half there are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly <UNK> and <UNK> some very dramatic scenes but there are also some very lame comedy moments coming specifically from <UNK> sister and her fiancée who happens to be the director of the movie billy is working on that almost ruin the film just because they are badly misplaced and or <UNK> and ruin the pace at the end the twists keep coming at a rapid fire speed and the climax of the film is appropriately as tense as the first half br br there are several things that really make the movie work the <UNK> of communication that billy must face both as a mute and as an american in <UNK> mean that even an <UNK> call for help becomes a dangerous situation the actress that plays billy natasha does a wonderful job in the film with an engaging on screen <UNK> and a brilliant performance and finally the direction as a whole but most particularly in the first half of the film which truly is a study in alfred hitchcock's suspense thriller film techniques br br as i have already said though the let downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added there is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of karen hughes and andy clarke the sister and the to turn their scenes into some unusual sit com however despite these shortcomings the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller and ideal for a group viewing at halloween certainly better than the usual slasher horror film
<START> i've watched this film about thirty years ago and it stuck in my mind until now when i came across it on dvd i didn't hesitate too long even more because i have a <UNK> for early <UNK> flicks but what a bad surprise some movies should be allowed to <UNK> from public exposure to <UNK> a certain memory and not to shock audiences br br widely <UNK> as one of <UNK> rare <UNK> works the only lasting impression i got from re watching it is boredom some movies really do not age in style but what about movies which didn't have any sense of style at all br br the flaws in the script uninspired acting presumably due to the lack of direction a sort of production design which doesn't deserve its name less than mediocre photography and last but not least the worst editing job i've seen in ages make this one truly hard to stand br br my impression was that there was a bunch of people with too much money and equipment but obviously no idea or any skills at all it really comes as a surprise that this one didn't abruptly end <UNK> career don't blame it on the overall bad taste of the 70s this one is crap in its own right and a worthy <UNK> for the most useless waste of celluloid ever
<START> pitch black was a complete shock to me when i first saw it back in 2000 in the previous years i was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci fi movies ex starship troopers and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different but to <UNK> put it this movie freaked me out in a good way i wasn't aware that i was still afraid of the dark till i watched this movie i must have buried my fear in the back of my <UNK> when i was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there br br the alien creatures sent <UNK> up my spine the individual s who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque br br i loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion br br <UNK> <UNK> gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping at first you figure him out to be a <UNK> intelligent villain but in some brief moments you can see something <UNK> behind his animal side but as soon you discover it he does something <UNK> <UNK> he certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end i didn't know whether to despise or admire him he's definitely a love hate type of character br br <UNK> cole <UNK> was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive john's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as <UNK> as <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> mitchell is a character who as <UNK> so nicely expressed looked to her <UNK> own ass first before considering the consequences but what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay <UNK> even while <UNK> her life when others <UNK> all human values and went for the dark hills running br br jack griffith simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in <UNK> through a child's eye good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil i thought it was absolutely priceless when jack <UNK> his head in <UNK> to <UNK> you know what they say imitation is the best form of <UNK> br br <UNK> keith david like jack has the ability to see good in any evil he uses philosophy to carry him through the <UNK> that he meets and when time <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> and then soldiers on in a way he served as a <UNK> <UNK> for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening br br the casting for this movie was positively perfect each actor <UNK> <UNK> in their role and their talents <UNK> wonderfully on screen br br this movie may have had a small budget but the director's <UNK> and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive special effects do all the work for them this movie is a definite sci fi classic watch it and judge with an open mind for yourself it will be well worth it
<START> a really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities br br it starts off with pregnant linda blair who runs down a <UNK> to flee what might be monsters or people with <UNK> i'm not sure she jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant the degree to which she is pregnant <UNK> widely throughout the movie br br she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies on the island already are david <UNK> and his german speaking virgin girlfriend you know how germans are said to love <UNK> he's taking photographs and she's <UNK> an <UNK> german book about witches i think br br also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman i thought was their daughter evidently she was an architect and linda blair and the boy are the older <UNK> children i guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed <UNK> br br the hotel seems neat certainly from the <UNK> but it isn't used to any great effect an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and <UNK> something in german sometimes which he eventually records on his <UNK> street tape <UNK> br br people start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something some of these gore scenes are ok but not enough to recommend the movie though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose <UNK> explode really seems to have been cut much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots since we're not seeing anything ourselves the <UNK> scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone he looked particularly nasty there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave exorcist behind her except for the <UNK> horror conventions br br in the weird largely italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also aka la <UNK> 4 and <UNK> 2 that is it is supposedly a sequel to <UNK> 3 <UNK> la 1988 it's not that's also a better movie than this one la <UNK> 1 and two were the evil dead 1981 and evil dead ii 1987 again unrelated to <UNK> and la <UNK> 3 and much better than those there's also a <UNK> 5 la 1990 aka house 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la <UNK> series and the series house house 1986 house ii the second story 1987 the horror show 1989 aka house iii and house iv 1992 <UNK> the horror show fit in there it doesn't really it claimed to be a sequel thus <UNK> the real series entry to <UNK> itself to cause less or more confusion oddly the horror show is also aka horror house and la <UNK> 5 is also aka horror house 2 does your head hurt yet
<START> just seen which way to the front on tcm uk it is a truly awful film if i'd paid at the pictures i'd have walked out br br a terrible mess of a film <UNK> lewis and his mates <UNK> around in cast off uniforms from an italian sci fi movie of 1960's were the <UNK> peace symbol <UNK> on the uniforms meant to be ironic the sets were pure 1970 i'm sure a hollywood tv back lot could have provided a more realistic set br br the film is <UNK> with racism the film takes the mickey out of veterans br br not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me
<START> i <UNK> when i heard the first <UNK> laugh track in the first few seconds of the show but yet i gave it a chance you know when someone offers a line which is only slightly amusing and you hear an obviously fake laugh track explode in <UNK> laughter that it's a show aimed at morons who need to be told yes it's funny go ahead and laugh br br ugh i couldn't stand this show as it revealed itself i can't speak for everyone after all some people actually like that idiotic show <UNK> which makes me wish to vomit i can imagine those who like <UNK> might actually like this drivel too some people still get a kick out of the old pull my finger gag to me this show is just about as witty and just about as original br br the themes were old and tired the jokes were lame and hackneyed the characters were ones we've seen everywhere before and the worst of any you might imagine br br so if you like things like <UNK> words and neighbors who say pull my finger you might actually like this show otherwise pass it by it's stupid and not in a clever or original way this one is about as old and tired as any show has ever been at its premiere
<START> alright we start in the office of a shrink and apparently not a very good one the main hero from the first jack frost is in the <UNK> office out random <UNK> about jack frost gee alright my brother is yelling it off <UNK> anyway back to the crappy movie br br the shrink has his <UNK> phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie but he looks nothing like him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they laugh at the poor sheriff <UNK> <UNK> now some people are digging up the anti snowman <UNK> <UNK> now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people i don't quite see how this has to do anything but their <UNK> the anti freeze evil killer mutant snowman with <UNK> <UNK> it shocking it adding strange and bizarre <UNK> to it the whole nine <UNK> nothing alright they give up and leave it in a fish tank one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank the janitor walks in <UNK> stuff <UNK> the and the coffee <UNK> the tank which makes jack alive br br behold the power of <UNK> now somehow he is in uh i believe the <UNK> but it looked more like hawaii but it couldn't be hawaii unless they spent all of their budget on the <UNK> air plane tickets <UNK> i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self er i wouldn't suggest doing so though <UNK>
<START> steve martin looks like he's had a face lift something very strange about his face i usually like anything steve does but this movie comes off as trashy not funny didn't think <UNK> <UNK> him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film
<START> as embarrassing as it is to admit i was listed as production manager on this film my very first as a matter of fact it was the first feature film for almost everyone who <UNK> watch carefully and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes as a soon to be murdered asylum attendant named my own last name br br originally titled <UNK> this picture was changed to another son of sam by the producer director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time nothing could have helped i don't even think this picture was good enough to be shown on <UNK> <UNK> br br the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early hand held cameras matter of fact the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and <UNK> north <UNK> in the mid seventies most of the stars were local tv <UNK> and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or <UNK> enough to believe former <UNK> and producer director dave a <UNK> <UNK> of br br if you enjoy watching this kind of picture you might love the work of another north the legendary earl br br
<START> there was no need for this movie plain and simple the original although hated by some was something i found to be actually really entertaining mainly because it was before jim carrey started to really lose his touch and cameron diaz was well <UNK> said so why make a sequel prequel thing honestly knowing that jim carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created but then they just make mistake after mistake jamie kennedy why is this man still allowed to breathe the writing and story terrible why would i ever want to see a baby wearing the mask moreover why would i want to see it fly ever how did someone think this was a good idea the acting is despicable in fact nearly everything about this movie is i'm trying to keep calm or imdb probably won't let me post this bottom line don't watch this piece of trash pick up the original see how good cameron diaz looked and how jim carrey used to have a career and laugh don't waste even a second of your time on this
<START> italian soft x exorcist clone br br woman buy statue of <UNK> thief said thief comes to life and turns out to be the devil with rape fantasies br br <UNK> <UNK> plays the devil brilliantly mostly due to his gift of evil looks and because he was never above doing nudity good on him br br the actress in the lead did a decent job her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped br br this one has a similar plot element to most italian horror films the girl's parents are filthy rich and <UNK> watch it to get the details br br laura <UNK> husband gabriel also appears as a random stud his part is basically <UNK> in but like a cheap beer it did the job br br fault the director for its <UNK> this could have been a horror sex classic
<START> i happened into the <UNK> this morning during the scene where ed was engaged in the 3 way and thought my wife was catching up on some early morning porn much to my surprise it grabbed my attention and i <UNK> it and we started watching it at 4 30 in the morning what a very entertaining rich funny and well developed plot line and script we both thoroughly enjoyed it my wife so much that she shared the experience with her girlfriends at work going on to recommend it and say what a kick she got out of it i am in my late 40's and she in her early 50's i think this movie would have appeal to both young and old an unexpected very enjoyable surprise nice work thanks two thumbs up
<START> it doesn't take balls to make fun of retarded people having to listen to <UNK> insist that he is brave to make <UNK> jokes is <UNK> also it doesn't take balls to bite off of the <UNK> show the racial game shows the racial <UNK> it seems like a lot of the skits are merely <UNK> <UNK> show skits that are just way less funny br br but the most <UNK> thing in the show is his <UNK> that he is just <UNK> to the beat of his own drum when he is actually <UNK> to the beat of many over worked over done drums that have been <UNK> many times br br i hate this show i hate that it presents itself as a voice for latin america br br and no carlos i am not trying to you if people like it then keep it on but i personally think that it's a bad show
<START> intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house <UNK> excellent as always threatened by a psychotic <UNK> ryan the 2 masters of the genre are at their <UNK> erotic best as they match wits emotions and <UNK> in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the saturday evening post richly <UNK> b w photography with an unusual amount of close up head shots the young girl who <UNK> ryan is really well directed here improbable but satisfying suburban melodrama
<START> this movie is a mystery it's not scary it's spooky you'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out it unfolds its mystery through the main character eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum don he needs her to search for some clues to <UNK> himself from murdering his mother and once eve agrees to help him she completely opens up <UNK> box and <UNK> some very strange things including i won't go into but i thought the way that played out was complete genius i know movie buffs won't regard this movie with the same <UNK> as other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous in it angelina <UNK> brother was excellent but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition but i do think the way the ending works is something to talk about i've recommended this to my friends definitely worth the purchase or rental price
<START> it is a rare and fine spectacle an allegory of death and that is neither preachy nor <UNK> a work of mature and courageous insight <UNK> avoids <UNK> distinction by <UNK> to belong to a kind unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to <UNK> an obvious comparison <UNK> <UNK> 1987 wings of desire der <UNK> <UNK> berlin it <UNK> an <UNK> in a narrative spectrum <UNK> from the mundane to the supernatural this story of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the american west <UNK> the fairytale that marked its german predecessor in the ad <UNK> genre of angels <UNK> their wings with <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> <UNK> be it inspired by <UNK> faith or <UNK> by a fever dream never parts ways with <UNK> and <UNK> this firm <UNK> to great credit for writers and directors mark and michael polish
<START> it's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation but there are just way too many death in this one start from the very beginning the story is all around battles fights death and revenge it goes on and on for entire one and a half hour it was interesting at the beginning but i grew very tire after before the show was half way through unlike other animations this one is lack of humor there are not many interactions between the characters either the good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice
<START> two of hollywood's great child stars elizabeth taylor and mickey rooney are perfectly teamed to deliver one of the all time family classics the story of a determined 12 year old girl whose <UNK> for horses won't allow her to turn away from her goal to win the british <UNK> mickey rooney is the newly <UNK> drifter looking to tie himself over until he can follow his own dreams br br a beautiful side plot reveals that the girl's mother had ambitions of her own as a young girl repeatedly the father's decisions in favor of their spirited daughter it is mother who seems to know best the scene where the exhausted taylor rushes to go to school is priceless father <UNK> why did you let her go to school she'll drop from <UNK> before <UNK> not to worry she'd be back within a half hour it was saturday the brilliant technicolor the <UNK> music score and those beautiful faces all telling a bittersweet story here's a good reason for the old saying they don't like that anymore
<START> where do i start do i say how great the cinematography is do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity do i tell how realistic the scenes on <UNK> island are should i mention that for a change we do not have the cliché scene of viewing statue of liberty by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships <UNK> is a cliché br br now whats not likable two major things one being a modern song score not even a good one to boot br br second nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow that watching paint dry would be an improvement br br the minute running time is to long yet the film seems unfinished we see no scenes of this family in the us our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother i would have enjoyed scenes of his <UNK> of maybe lucky search instead of other drawn out scenes br br the film is a near miss br br ratings out of 4 <UNK> points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10
<START> <UNK> rules of engagement does a very good job of not drawing conclusions for its viewers it simply presents interviews footage from the <UNK> footage of the <UNK> <UNK> phone conversations expert <UNK> etc and allows you to draw your own conclusion br br i hardly intend to imply that the data presented here was done with 100 <UNK> but it is very convincing you won't like any more after you see this than you did before but i tend to think that you will come to believe as i now do there is much that we were not told about what happened before and during the <UNK>
<START> based on a fairly bland best <UNK> this film like most other lifetime movies played out more like a <UNK> than an actual movie the only difference here was that meredith <UNK> wasn't in it the women in this don't age even over a span of like 20 years and the acting in general is pretty bad br br the characters in this were all cliché and one dimensional the story was of the cheesy nature i wouldn't recommend it but it's the kind of thing that people who loved the book and people who watch that network all the time will think is great i only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister <UNK> to her it wasn't made for someone like me my girlfriend cried a little at the end though so she didn't think it was as terrible as i did
<START> lights of new york was the first all talking feature film there had been of course the jazz singer released in <UNK> <UNK> as the first feature film <UNK> <UNK> dialog however this film released in july <UNK> is virtually <UNK> for its place in film history it had started out as a short but gradually more was tacked on until <UNK> in at <UNK> minutes it accidentally became the first all talking feature film it opened to a <UNK> house run and to warner bros surprise made over a million dollars that was good money back in <UNK> br br the plot is quite simple two country <UNK> <UNK> buy into a <UNK> shop on broadway that <UNK> as a speak easy for the <UNK> a gangster when they learn the truth they can't afford to get out because the younger <UNK> eddie has all of his mother's money tied up in the place kitty is the younger girlfriend and gangster <UNK> <UNK> has an eye for turning in his older girlfriend <UNK> for a newer model chorus girl kitty <UNK> a cop is killed while trying to stop the <UNK> men from <UNK> a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> sees it as an opportunity to frame eddie thus getting kitty for himself br br this early <UNK> is loads of fun for the <UNK> of these <UNK> works sure the plot is <UNK> and the dialog stilted but there is something you don't see much of in early <UNK> background musical <UNK> <UNK> had originally been used for this very purpose and here they are still using it for musical <UNK> along with the dialog and there are singing and dancing numbers the scenes in <UNK> nightclub are used as an opportunity to show off what films could never do before musical numbers there is even a wild eyed <UNK> with some heavy makeup left over from the silent era that is a hoot to watch br br <UNK> could not go <UNK> at this point due to the static camera so the scene in the park between the two lovers eddie and kitty is <UNK> and cheaply the <UNK> looks like something out of an ed wood movie or perhaps a high school production of our town br br <UNK> as the <UNK> girlfriend delivers her lines with punch she's a real <UNK> considering what lines she has to deliver to the <UNK> so you think you can have any chicken you want and throw me back in the deck huh mixed <UNK> anyone and then there are her final lines i've lived and i've loved and i've lost did someone get paid to write this dialog was making a good success of her <UNK> career after <UNK> some <UNK> in silent films the evil sister in seventh heaven when a fatal car accident cut her career short br br then there is eugene palette the older of the two <UNK> in our story his frog voice natural delivery of lines and <UNK> appearance gave him a long career as a character actor usually appearing as a put upon family man businessman with a gruff exterior and heart of gold in fact mr palette is the only member of this cast who still has a notable career in films just three years after this movie is released br br finally there is the question of where is that <UNK> hidden <UNK> were still <UNK> at this point and it's fun to figure out where they've hidden it there is one famous scene though where everybody can pretty much figure it out <UNK> is in his office talking to his two henchman who seem to comprehend as slowly as they talk about taking eddie for a ride if you watch this scene you'd swear the phone on the desk is a character in this film it's front and center during the whole conversation the <UNK> is likely planted in the phone br br there is something heroic about these <UNK> flying blind in the face of the new technology of sound you have silent actors who are <UNK> to using <UNK> for expression <UNK> who know how to play to a live audience but don't know how to make the same impression on a <UNK> camera booth and you have dialog writers either trying to write conversation as as they did title cards or filling up films with endless <UNK> br br check this one out it is not boring moves fast and is loads of fun if you know what to look for and no i don't expect this one to ever be out on <UNK> ray but i hope that the folks at warner brothers add it to the warner archive soon so everyone can see it
<START> for my money probably the best film or at least the most purely cinematic film director ford ever made the dialog is swift <UNK> to the point l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits ford uses a relatively small cast but directs them and photographs them with a <UNK> and a <UNK> of epic proportions <UNK> realistic <UNK> amusing brilliantly acted hard to believe couldn't become a leading man after this with the best photography and editing in any american black and white film owes an awful lot to <UNK> <UNK> editing technique but never as <UNK> detached or as <UNK> could frequently get and a great musical score a magnificent <UNK> of an important and poorly understood episode in american history br br one little <UNK> it's not clear why the film involves the <UNK> who as far as i know were never the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> were this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after taste br br however the rest of the film is such a feast this is easy to ignore in all other ways a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be <UNK> and looked at again and again and again
<START> everyone likes the <UNK> created memorable heist movie <UNK> <UNK> provides the <UNK> <UNK> provides the cool and a handful of other great talent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maria and andre mostly arrives to add a crisp engaging movie br br with very little dialog this is great because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick witted and their various <UNK> this movie however could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed not to say the sound is bad oh no the <UNK> soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow patient <UNK> of the patients very compelling br br what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic usually when it comes to cinematography black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe br br <UNK>
<START> yes i am sentimental and yes i love movies where kids are the better humans true does have some logical or even plot shortcomings these are more than <UNK> by the kids' great acting <UNK> first movie role at all and the charm of a dogma film i liked this kind of art long before the dogma ever since <UNK> <UNK> well i cried through the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than <UNK> or fly away home had for me
<START> this must be one of the most annoying arrogant <UNK> films i've ever seen what a waste of budget and actors <UNK> has reached new levels of <UNK> it is clear there is virtually no plot even if this part of greek history is material for great movies he simply had some supposedly symbolic actually <UNK> scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them death is the main theme and is repeated ad <UNK> along with and the like which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself a totally incoherent result which can only leave you saying huh or oh dear every two minutes br br there is no character development at all <UNK> <UNK> i'm usually complaining about some movies having two dimensional characters but oh boy he managed to create one dimensional characters this is irritating for us and <UNK> for some of the actors he even managed to make one of my favourite greek actors <UNK> seem wooden br br and going to the core of <UNK> film making no we're not idiots we do not want <UNK> food please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle theo do you really <UNK> your audience so much or you're simply incompetent personally i think he tried to make a greek underground no matter how he tries he can't reach kusturica br br only saving grace photography costumes and the music
<START> i can see what this film was <UNK> to do unfortunately it just never quite <UNK> the deal the reality crime aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate in fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly <UNK> in a moody sort of way notably the <UNK> of the detective talking to the beat up woman the scene of the detectives going through the garbage and the father <UNK> flies on occasion s few scenes <UNK> down in too much dialog instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book but the real problem lies in the editing the story does not flow it fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts in the end you are confused as to what is actually happening those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along <UNK> together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do with such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this
<START> i can't say if the <UNK> is a ripoff of the cave because i haven't seen that i've seen the descent and that's not terrible but it is very hard to watch and so is this one hard to watch as in there's very little light and lots of fast motion so you're hard pressed to say what you're looking at there are times when i guess you're supposed to be scared judging from the music but scared of what bad camera work poor lighting if that's the case than this should be the scariest movie made the story is that a bunch of cave <UNK> go to a cave in <UNK> home of <UNK> and make their descent but something is of course in there with them and what is it one guy says it's a wolf bear hybrid that is just before he gets ripped apart but whatever it is you can't see it and just when you think or hope the film is ending since the screen goes dark for a bit you see the two remaining the two women wake up somewhere in betty and <UNK> and start trying to find their way out of wherever they are they do drink some water and start eating something until they figure out what it is and start <UNK> and then the mystery of what's in the cave appears and you'll just be <UNK> maybe maybe not dumb dumb dumb i think i'm pretty well done with cave movies at this point 2 out of 10
<START> i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a <UNK> warehouse sale one day when just looking around the cover looked pretty good in colour but the movie is b w i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with <UNK> covers on b w movies but it's a common thing to look out for br br when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be better than i expected i was disappointed that it was a b w but the effects are pretty good certainly better than say <UNK> from mars which has crappy effects and it is great to see john <UNK> in something else apart from <UNK> heroes br br overall this movie isn't too bad for a b grade and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view it isn't my favourite sci fi but it's not my worst either it's o k
<START> larry bishop the writer actor director focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film <UNK> to meaningless <UNK> and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a <UNK> ride from the film's start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb br br the <UNK> are presented as <UNK> <UNK> who seek their own form of justice for what they see as <UNK> they are <UNK> anti heroes and protagonists played by larry bishop is the leader of the pack the <UNK> michael madsen is trapped in his own <UNK> of chaos and <UNK> br br <UNK> eric <UNK> is loyal but mysterious <UNK> performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticket <UNK> if you decide to see the film you'll be sorry but you'll find out why billy wings <UNK> jones is a <UNK> and <UNK> character completely filled with disdain br br what <UNK> me is how this film with all of its <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ever got anybody to <UNK> in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticket <UNK> take my advice don't pay for the ride please don't make the same mistake as the <UNK> br br the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and <UNK> the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesn't make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads <UNK> throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just won't give a damn mama <UNK> stay home and by all means don't take the ride i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero
<START> i have to rate this movie at a 10 i'm sorry but i think it's classic comedy then if you're rating it to other madonna movies well what you wanna tell me it wasn't her best movie ever didn't mira sorvino win an oscar for almost the same performance not ten years later please this movie deserves much more credit than it gets plus i like to think of it as an a <UNK> study into the <UNK> of the 80's remember when you could from sam <UNK> and in the same day remember when women wore <UNK> <UNK> proudly so it was no last emperor it was still good there are certain movies i'd be willing to watch everyday three actually that <UNK> up my day and make me smile if you like who's that girl then i'd also recommend party girl and <UNK> and <UNK> high school reunion
<START> brilliant acting excellent plot wonderful special effects this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of on my head for the entire film instead i endured a 2 hour crap o <UNK> our brilliant story begins with some <UNK> who has nothing better to do than look in <UNK> in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms instead he finds a man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some <UNK> cave folk br br in his <UNK> wisdom along with his infinitely large nose he decides to go inside this <UNK> with a team of special people to travel to this underground land they go by plane no boat no they use this giant soup can with a solid metal <UNK> on the end that i swear i saw <UNK> in <UNK> this movie was <UNK> than oh that's right this was the <UNK> movie i've seen for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie i warn you if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your <UNK> and give yourself a full frontal <UNK> br br the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1 10 i give this a 10 10
<START> a wonderful story about the consequences of obsessive love with the beautiful romantic back streets of paris as its location we're transported through time and see the plot develop from the perspectives of the three main characters as the mystery <UNK>
<START> we still really love the movie and soundtrack valley girl i have owned it on video for <UNK> and wore out the original soundtrack i have several friends with whom i get together and we have 80's <UNK> parties where we get together and play 80's music and run valley girl on the big screen and we're all in our 30's now we have an awesome time br br it's all in good fun like ya know
<START> where to start some guy has some indian pot that he's cleaning and suddenly <UNK> attacks he hits a woman in the neck with an axe she falls down but then gets up and is apparently <UNK> she runs into the woods and it turns out there's the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods she meets a <UNK> worker and <UNK> attacks again luckily like any good <UNK> worker he's got a gun and shoots at the guy doesn't work everything starts on fire br br cut to some people walking through the woods even though they've been <UNK> together for some time they sit down and introduce themselves to each other wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met anyhow they're undercover <UNK> team members undercover i suppose because that way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school <UNK> and oh i can't remember the rest it doesn't matter eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things anyhow they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods he wants <UNK> you know like <UNK> and <UNK> he <UNK> some stuff i can only assume that it's the premise of the movie i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials because you can't really understand anything he says br br so they walk around the woods some more all the dialogue is a load of quasi military macho <UNK> i mean all of it as in every single word like this reminds me of when we were in <UNK> or this reminds me of when we were in <UNK> attacks again let me give you a <UNK> of a basic attack one of the female characters is behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse for some reason she doesn't fire but yells several times for someone else then as <UNK> approaches she jumps out from behind the tree so that <UNK> can stick her with his <UNK> then everybody starts shooting the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet they don't make sparks br br then casper van <UNK> is all of a sudden driving a semi truck trying to run over <UNK> he misses and the truck <UNK> to a stop van <UNK> is injured apparently he <UNK> across the seat and <UNK> his hip on the window <UNK> or something so he <UNK> out of the truck and it explodes later he's in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasi military macho <UNK> they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their undercover status by immediately <UNK> themselves as being from the army they beat on the guys for some reason then they go away br br some other stuff happens people <UNK> the camera shakes etc br br i think it comes to an end eventually br br my theory is that the sci fi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be like you think our movies are bad well you haven't seen bad here's bad okay now that we've got that out of the way the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison right br br well it's just a theory
<START> glenn ford a new york boy who has been saving his cash thumbs and <UNK> his way to the arizona ranch he has bought where he hopes to find heaven with a <UNK> wire fence br br a film with a dalton script and story directed by villain <UNK> <UNK> cortez and starring the frequently <UNK> glenn ford and the restless richard <UNK> just shouldn't be so bloody nice though the system mostly seen as mean cops and <UNK> <UNK> and real estate con men is as awful as one might expect from the mr every single <UNK> is just so sweet and nice and salt of the earth that one feels <UNK> it doesn't help that the heroine a sweet blonde thing who is an illegal alien <UNK> fleeing <UNK> spain is annoying for reasons of both scripting and acting br br so why watch richard <UNK> in his first role already has his persona and a pretty good part and there are some moments of 30s <UNK> camp that are pretty astonishing did dalton absolutely have to set a major portion of the movie in the russian <UNK> mission all that was missing was a portrait of a <UNK> joe <UNK> also this is glenn ford's first <UNK> role though his performance isn't good br br why not watch essentially the movie offers an unconvincing vision is <UNK> to a political viewpoint that is <UNK> and the two leads have made much better movies also the strengths of dalton as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence instead we get a film that the <UNK> brothers barton <UNK> could have written in a flash and avoided that <UNK> bout with writer's block
<START> watching the is not likely to result in deep thoughts unlike many other great ford films like the <UNK> my darling <UNK> the man who shot liberty <UNK> and the <UNK> of wrath among others but it is likely to produce a feeling of awe and deep satisfaction the story is very simple two <UNK> decide to help a <UNK> train of <UNK> get to california along the way they run into a medicine man whose <UNK> ran away a group of bank robbers and some <UNK> there's a lot of adventure and excitement on the trail and the film is <UNK> with fun and beauty the music is absolutely beautiful the scenery again from <UNK> valley is as beautiful as it ever was plus how can you go wrong with james <UNK> the might not be one of john ford's better known films but it is nonetheless a must see if you get the chance 9 10
<START> i'm not one of those folks who <UNK> <UNK> a film based on an old tv show comes out rather i usually run out and see it if i had watched the show and try to get nostalgic but if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows this is exhibit a so you can actually say something more than just navy <UNK> squad is dreary <UNK> and <UNK> at least the original series was angst <UNK> long before anyone knew teens could be so <UNK> making it groundbreaking this is just tedious claire danes is nice to look at but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around <UNK> on the baddies <UNK> <UNK> acting extent in this flick is that <UNK> the dog look for an hour and forty five minutes and omar <UNK> looks like he wants to flee the set but the <UNK> has trapped him sure the production is nice with the now seemingly rave nightclub opening action sequence and <UNK> <UNK> oh and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too it's kind of like deciding to use the scooby doo mystery machine to go on a family vacation to hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your <UNK> know need heavy therapy and <UNK> drugs i really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments but the next scene would suck the life out of it you can knock another spelling remake charlie's angels all you want but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself the <UNK> squad makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went
<START> most of the films i really like are art house fare and seldom appear on the box office top ten lists that said i found <UNK> utterly incomprehensible i have no idea what it was even about writing in the new york times about a different film stephen <UNK> once observed that some people seem to think they can throw just anything up on the screen and have it work as a fairy tale i thought of that review several times while watching <UNK> br br on a scale of one to ten i gave it a two
<START> robin hood men in <UNK> is worth watching i recently watched it because i've just become a cary <UNK> fan and this is one of of his lead roles some moments really made me crack up so hard i didn't expect them you know it was so funny even the 2nd time around you'd still fall off your chair the cast is great of course especially robin of himself cary but and the sheriff and little john don't let the name fool you it's big lol and everyone else br br there were some moments of course the film tried to make a comedic scene out of but you don't necessarily laugh at it but ok br br this is the second time cary <UNK> and patrick stewart appeared in a film together by the way they both worked on lady jane in 1986 and it was fun to see them 7 years later older <UNK> br br it's definitely worth watching quite hilarious indeed
<START> the whole <UNK> for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are blue the blue state mentality this is supposed to get us off the hook for what is was happening during the last few years in our country the usa it doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we aren't <UNK> in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a us citizen gets just by being a us citizen br br but i'm so sick of <UNK> about this it doesn't do any good i haven't taken much action lately and i wonder how many people have maybe i'm just down because my job was <UNK> last month and now i'm looking for work in the <UNK> tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to india and other places overseas i'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up <UNK> and the <UNK> job market and the obsession with war these days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and <UNK> about there <UNK> anyway back to this review usa the movie is an obscure dvd that makes me realize that some people have taken action whether it's through politics <UNK> or arts or media the filmmaker is obviously passionate <UNK> willing to go outside the norm frustrated unique <UNK> etc br br i looked through the whole site that's linked to the dvd and got lost in all the <UNK> <UNK> etc that are there the dvd does that too has references to different times views and historical points sometimes someone does something out there
<START> if corky st claire in waiting for <UNK> had directed the citizens of <UNK> in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the monster br br to be generous this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie i've ever seen to call the pace <UNK> is to be kind br br almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben who did the really admirable considering the budget special effects he went on to do sound for movies like <UNK> and several other big budget projects the narration is by veteran voice over actor paul <UNK> who probably <UNK> his efforts br br when you're watching the opening titles and see the <UNK> school district listed as one of the producers you know you're going on a long strange trip br br <UNK> at the down dump in california becomes so toxic that it creates a monster remember that this is 1975 and <UNK> was a hot topic just a few years previously <UNK> had been treated to godzilla vs the <UNK> monster br br so far so good the monster is a <UNK> creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart instead it steals garbage <UNK> br br central to the premise is the idea that this monster can <UNK> a small city and leave eight foot long <UNK> behind but not be noticed by anyone there's a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices br br the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george the town drunk all through the movie i hoped hoped hoped that george would be torn to <UNK> on camera but this didn't happen <UNK> in fact nobody gets killed george supposedly sacrifices himself to save <UNK> he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature george <UNK> worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the <UNK> br br the <UNK> leads are a group of high school students there's pretty <UNK> and her <UNK> boyfriend and some bad boys who surprise surprise whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes br br the monster is involved in four main set pieces he attacks a <UNK> <UNK> garbage truck and leaves it beside an <UNK> highway but nobody notices he walks through the carnival again <UNK> he tears up a building nice <UNK> work and nobody sees him but george then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs <UNK> and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times most recently this past winter br br there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped local citizens <UNK> at city hall because they want their garbage <UNK> back an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is <UNK> in by private jet examined and forgotten br br so why did i watch the whole thing because these people were having so <UNK> much fun i had the idea that the <UNK> were <UNK> the <UNK> were being filmed in their own <UNK> <UNK> may well live in that suburban <UNK> house and scenes of people in their <UNK> may well have been in their own <UNK> br br they may not be great actors but they are real people nobody is stunningly good looking in fact i'd <UNK> that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have <UNK> bad facial hair one <UNK> being interviewed before a meeting at hall has such a loud tie and that you think he's on his way to play in the music man br br and that got the movie two extra stars zero for the story two points for the sometimes decent special effects and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this they can actually say they've performed in a movie despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i can't say that and i'm happy for them br br remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland at some point somebody would say let's put on a show aunt <UNK> has all those old clothes in the attic and we can use uncle <UNK> <UNK> then they'd do <UNK> with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if <UNK> today br br that's the spirit that the good people of had for this project and bless them for that

<START> this is the forty minute film that introduces us to the character of the butcher who will later be examined more thoroughly in the feature <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this film it follows the early period of his life from 1965 1979 but focusing on the late seventies the first images are of a slaughter of a horse then the birth of a baby the <UNK> daughter who we quickly see growing up each year the butcher played by <UNK> in both films is a man bitter with the world he hates many things his anger comes to a head when a man <UNK> his <UNK> daughter the butcher then <UNK> the wrong man and finds himself in prison br br this film follows the <UNK> life to just after his release from prison then <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> takes over from there i watched the films the wrong way about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> first try and watch this little film first if you can
<START> wow i just saw this movie on the sundance channel and it really is bizarre i may not be a film expert but it's probably the most bizarre film i as an average movie fan have seen br br whoever came up with with it had a great imagination i'm a bit of a fan of japanese dramas and there are often actors from dramas in movies for example the lead in <UNK> is a major j drama star but it looks like this is the first film for and <UNK> i must say if they really are <UNK> here they do a pretty good job br br was a very sympathetic character i thought she was easy to relate with she was kind and good hearted perhaps not the most popular girl but <UNK> than some of the other attention seeking girls she was also pretty in a classic kind of way i hope she does more films but it's been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans br br the ending was odd i'm not going to give anything away but the rest of the movie's <UNK> was kind of put to shame br br very bizarre but very imaginative and unique movie i'd recommend it for japanese horror fans though i'll warn you it's a lot more bizarre than <UNK> br br nonetheless i'd give it a 7 5 out of 10 for originality imagination good characterization above average acting and just being plain intriguing
<START> as a movie the italian job is ok at best good not great acting br br nice visuals and pacing a mediocre plot but nothing bad enough br br to walk out on but as a car commercial for the new breed of mini br br <UNK> this film is spectacular br br spoilers br br ok it's a typical heist film with the odd twist the underwater safe cracking was nice if not improbable and the cast was fairly solid br br with the exception of a <UNK> <UNK> but when it all came br br down to it the real stars of this picture were the three mini br br <UNK> in all their high flying speed racing <UNK> jumping br br bullet taking gold <UNK> shiny new glory the audience i was br br sitting amongst actually and when <UNK> little br br red number first hit the screen strangely enough neither she nor br br <UNK> garnered the same reaction br br the film starts out promising <UNK> <UNK> seth green donald br br sutherland edward norton and jason <UNK> all begin as an br br interesting and <UNK> band of characters with the only real br br uninspired performance being that of the usually good mark br br <UNK> why he claims this is his best film i can't imagine his br br character is completely one note and he plays him so <UNK> it br br was as if mr rogers came back from the dead and was <UNK> br br his body <UNK> is fine as <UNK> daughter though br br nothing magical seth <UNK> character is perfect and the br br running jokes including a cameo by <UNK> br br shawn fanning are hilarious he and some of <UNK> <UNK> early br br lines add some much needed sparks of humour unfortunately br br edward norton and donald sutherland don't get near enough br br screen time br br you can see most of the plot coming from a mile away and the br br dialogue is <UNK> with bad one liners and give <UNK> but i doubt the br br filmmakers were out to re <UNK> the wheel here so taken as a br br typical action suspense flick it comes out alright worth seeing on br br cheap night i'd recommend br br 7 10 not worth it's weight in gold but makes for nice <UNK>
<START> i should have known better the clues were all over imdb com this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record the cast is a bunch of <UNK> with the possible exception of joe <UNK> who seems to <UNK> in bad movies etc suffice it to say i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful amateurish attempt at film making turn on any broadcast channel at <UNK> and you'll see better movies <UNK> said
<START> since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline i won't do it br br however i'd like to <UNK> that interpretation is terrific as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film br br reading the previous comments i've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to <UNK> and that those little present are <UNK> in my honest opinion this is far from true br br there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving <UNK> and wanting him to stay and understanding his desire to die most obvious of those are the family for instance sister in law never talks for or against <UNK> another such character is the social rights <UNK> who in the last moment tells <UNK> to re think it all the scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die br br then there are characters who are clearly against <UNK> brother is clearly against it as is his father there's only one thing worse than the death of son and it's having a son that wants to die other users have commented that the discussion between <UNK> and the priest is <UNK> and filmed to make us think that <UNK> is good and the priest is bad well no doubt the scene is comic but that doesn't mean the priest is <UNK> or <UNK> from my point of view the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince <UNK> to keep on living using arguments totally alien to thinking the <UNK> speech goes on the line of god gives and god takes we aren't the owners of our own lives they belong to god and so on the comedy <UNK> from the fact that <UNK> is <UNK> and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense br br this film is the <UNK> of it leaves the <UNK> the chance to think on the subject and make up his her own opinion and above anything else is a <UNK> of freedom
<START> may contain spoilers br br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just can't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen <UNK> and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name br br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over the top characters and more inconsistencies than george w <UNK> college career i don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a <UNK> or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was <UNK> in this film how do we know it's him like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with <UNK> a great camp film but a very bad film overall
<START> <UNK> will never be listed as one of john wayne's better post <UNK> film it's good in spots has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the <UNK> at the climax but the plot leaves a lot to be desired br br what we have in <UNK> is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike <UNK> them from working as a team <UNK> cedric <UNK> has hired john wayne and james <UNK> to build a <UNK> but then he refuses to give them the needed <UNK> to do the job right br br things get really complicated when wayne falls for <UNK> daughter <UNK> day after a night when they have to spend time alone in an <UNK> ruin by convention in south america wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened br br what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another their petty cause some <UNK> among wayne's crew br br but what <UNK> is most known for is another piece of <UNK> <UNK> day was married to leo the manager of the brooklyn <UNK> when this was being filmed he was a constant presence on the set insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife nothing to it but he made his wife's life miserable br br not one of the <UNK> better efforts
<START> clyde borrows the premise of this short from buster keaton's seven chances recently <UNK> remade as the bachelor in the original buster has 24 hours to get married in order to <UNK> a large sum of money in this version musical teacher <UNK> <UNK> has only 7 hours after all it is a short this is one of the better stooges shorts due to the storyline and wonderful routines including the <UNK> booth scene with moe <UNK> reminiscent of laurel <UNK> <UNK> marks and the marx brothers famous scene in night at the opera here the boys hold their own in their variation of this routine i'm not a huge stooges fan but this one should be noted by any student of comedy as one of their very best since the early 30s shorts
<START> this is a nice movie with good performances by paz vega and <UNK> of course <UNK> is a legend in spanish cinema and surely one of the great directors in spanish cinema but i don't think this is one of his greatest movies even if it's fine the screenplay plays with the introduction of as a character it's a nice touch but it's unbelievable the music is composed by jose national spanish prize in cinema i mean this movie is very good in all the technical aspects there are very good actors in supporting roles like antonio maria and others i give it 7 out of 10 cause i think this could be a better movie but as it is it is not boring at all
<START> it is difficult to imagine how the engaging dan brown novel angels and demons could misfire as badly as this film version here are ten reasons why the film was a failure due to the spoilers please do no read on unless you have already seen the film br br 1 in the film there was no love relationship between robert <UNK> and worse still there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors br br 2 the breathtaking locations in rome as described in the novel were not realized visually in the film i am aware that director ron howard encountered difficulties in filming on location but there are superior photographed depictions of rome on the history channel than in this film where the eternal city was presented in eternal stock film footage the great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film the magnificent <UNK> of the ecstasy of st <UNK> was only <UNK> <UNK> and the west relief in <UNK> square was not visible at all br br 3 the most tasteless choice made by the film maker was in the depiction of the deceased <UNK> who actually <UNK> the beloved john paul ii in the novel the <UNK> is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real <UNK> br br 4 one of the most colorful and important characters of the novel <UNK> <UNK> director of was cut out of the screenplay br br 5 there were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were <UNK> due to <UNK> background noise br br 6 there were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and <UNK> film lighting this technique worked in the godfather films but ron howard is no gordon willis br br 7 the college of <UNK> was quite a <UNK> crew with one of the speaking in a southern <UNK> this dude would have been more at home on a texas ranch than in the <UNK> <UNK> br br 8 the crucial relationship of the and the deceased <UNK> was not defined in the film this relationship was central to the theme of science vs religion and the relevance of the to the plot against the church br br 9 in the novel the character of was an unforgettable villain in the film that assassin character's role was a cardboard <UNK> villain br br 10 as a whole the filmmakers did not trust the <UNK> of the successful novel br br in the novel <UNK> makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the river in ron <UNK> film it was the movie itself that landed in the

<START> children of wax also shown as killing grounds is an interesting mixture of genres some might think the <UNK> of the genre can be only for good but to me the <UNK> is very entertaining it is also in it's story the mixture of thriller and the popular action as well as the combination of the historic masterpiece and the ethnic <UNK> for tolerance this film is built with the <UNK> presence of my favorite actor the perfect <UNK> <UNK> but it is also marked by the acting of a shooting star  hal we have recently seen him in the tv series on hbo called sex children of wax is entertainment for the audience but the same time it has an <UNK> moral for the ethnic tolerance this is a wise way to <UNK> discussion on the contemporary troubles of our days can be made with attractive means in this is very positive side of the film children of wax
<START> this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't walk through the cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements but only to a slight degree also you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro it's terrible i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something this game sucks the graphics are good but nothing special the game play however is awful to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement i got it on sale but i want my 20 back what a waste
<START> first off just let me say that i live in south africa where <UNK> is our biggest sport by far and our national side the have won the <UNK> world cup twice so it's quite a big deal over here i've played all my life and i'm shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie at first i thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of <UNK> <UNK> nick <UNK> gary cole and sean <UNK> for goodness sake but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport they basically <UNK> it together with your normal everyday american football movie br br my first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values of <UNK> but the discipline or should i say the total lack thereof during the games are <UNK> to this in the final it looks more like an <UNK> game with <UNK> being <UNK> of the ball numerous times in front of the <UNK> that would've immediately led to a couple of red cards because foul play like that would never go <UNK> in by a <UNK> of that i can assure you you'd also not be able to find a coach in world <UNK> who would have so little control over his team any coach would take a dump on a players head if he intentionally stiff arms an <UNK> player or double teams him like they did in the final red card and certain suspension full stop br br secondly it's absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played wing all of his life i gather move him to hooker which is a highly <UNK> position and say that it's for the good of the team what hooker is a highly <UNK> position in the front row where you have to be able to extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball in at line out time which <UNK> never does for some or other reason by moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long term training it would firstly lead to your <UNK> demise at time secondly the poor kid would probably break his neck how is that good for the team i ask you finally the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is way too much because even though <UNK> is a great sport and it builds great friendships team spirit it rarely gets that out of hand corny i've seen true life football <UNK> with less emotion than this movie it turned out great but in this one <UNK> <UNK> acting skills is dragged way too far and the movie attempts too force an emotional response out of the audience which ends up being boring and hard to watch at times br br hollywood have made some great sports movies over the years but next time they venture into a sport which has just recently picked up in the states they should try and do their <UNK> maybe get some experts into the <UNK> br br do it right or don't do it at all
<START> ok fans it's out on dvd but the only reason to watch this is 1 to say you did due to its <UNK> or 2 if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan i am not a hardcore <UNK> fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom it's a shame because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson sure it's gross but it's bad and not in a good way if after reading all the comments on how <UNK> revolting and filthy this movie is you are still interested do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting <UNK> filth instead films by john waters david lynch peter jackson's <UNK> <UNK> basket case etc all come to mind there's lots better out there

<START> br br first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la <UNK> br br i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in <UNK> br br so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know <UNK> from all over europe <UNK> so why do you who find this music <UNK> care to comment at all br br
<START> another eli roth in the making self promoting bad script writing excuse for a horror director victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary <UNK> reference to the disney score what is going on here you have marilyn <UNK> opening and closing this piece of crap and <UNK> <UNK> bang bang all through it can this even be called horror horrible yes but horror is a stretch david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man <UNK> please stop these fan boy want to be directors now the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true stop the insanity i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch
<START> 4 son my game mad <UNK> i cant wait 2 get on <UNK> show and roll up in da club n do it real style wit mad models n <UNK> son br br no i'm just kidding this is a sad show created by and for the enjoyment of sad men men who are so <UNK> by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the <UNK> where they <UNK> out fleeting self <UNK> <UNK> on chicks in hopes of getting their little touched to try and dull the <UNK> of loneliness and make them feel even if just for one night as though their seat on the board of the <UNK> party of toronto is a little less permanent br br i read some comments on here saying that this show represents canadian tv's finally stepping up to stand on a par with american tv or well that's not aiming short at all it's like yes pat yourself on the back canada you've finally <UNK> the <UNK> formula for such groundbreaking american content as <UNK> change of heart and the fifth wheel see the real <UNK> here is meets <UNK> camera onto the pitch genius and there's nothing that that thin line between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> homosexuality like a group of grown men <UNK> each other on hidden camera <UNK> each other's game up in the club the man love on display here is so <UNK> they should really consider it keys to the steam bath br br on a side note how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have <UNK> an imdb account for the express purpose of doing so i guess i'm guilty of <UNK> the same means to do the opposite here my personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to <UNK> from the united states who <UNK> that now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television br br smooth br br but why even bother <UNK> online buzz you can't really get cancelled after all you're on the comedy network in canada baby the viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come in all <UNK> you'll be just fine <UNK> <UNK> along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the comedy <UNK> original programming
<START> i turned this off within the first five minutes it's very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the <UNK> and it's skull was <UNK> by a small <UNK> <UNK> this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies <UNK> it didn't i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched <UNK> without a <UNK> which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which <UNK> my night as i couldn't hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentary br br reading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very <UNK> and profound but not aesthetic
<START> i recently rented this video after seeing final <UNK> by the same writer i wasn't prepared for how intense this film would get i found it engaging from start to finish and was rooting for the teenagers to get away with their attempted crime the ending was definitely disturbing with some of its implied violence but well done i highly recommend this picture
<START> it's painfully clear that all effort in this film was directed toward cinematography and very little attention to everything else most obvious mistake is the miscast of the entire female cast many of them are very experienced and capable but they all seemed out of place and having an amateur director certainly didn't help the story is a very common geisha story and characters <UNK> very <UNK> thus making it extremely difficult for me to connect with the heroine br br this movie's theme is modern prostitution but still it was annoying how <UNK> lead character kept talking like a female motorcycle gang member while everyone else spoke in old japanese fitting for this setting this movie has very beautiful vibrant colors similar to zhang <UNK> hero but viewers can easily tell it's filmed in a cheap elaborate set br br the two sequences with <UNK> insert songs were really nice though in mid section of the movie i actually really disliked her music before but they fit perfectly in this movie although is a complete failure as a film director she has a major potential in <UNK> music video production br br i believe the story felt very plain because the director failed to focus on character development and because <UNK> unconvincing acting as an <UNK> had this film been directed by a known director with any other known actress in japan it would've had the potential to become a masterpiece
<START> if you thought <UNK> trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love was <UNK> wait <UNK> you see him acting horny in this <UNK> silly second sequel dean jones is back as the driver who <UNK> in the paris to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this time his <UNK> <UNK> falls in love with another car in the race a driven by julie by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in rides <UNK> the movie is overlong and <UNK> although it's watchable thanks to the return of <UNK> typically likable performance a few funny bits and the <UNK> frantic <UNK>
<START> this little film is hysterical full of stereotypes about gays <UNK> <UNK> british tea and <UNK> american gun culture divorce and marriage yet it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each kathy bates is amazing grace <UNK> and as a character actor of <UNK> range she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in fried green with the help of other comedic talents like dan as max her ex lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown chicago and rural england the story is just intriguing enough to entertain jonathan price plays victor fox a closet gay singer murdered by a cross bow killer in chicago his <UNK> lover <UNK> simpson played by the stunning rupert everett must overcome <UNK> siblings including <UNK> redgrave who want to turn their home into a tribute museum and teams with bates and her dwarf daughter in law <UNK> to find the killer among the homeless of chicago br br the entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit and are excellent <UNK> the talented price and bates this implausible storyline both funny and bizarre is one of the most off center films cameos by julie andrews barry and sally jesse <UNK> should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is strange funny and off center but with a good perspective about people with every kind of difference
<START> a german <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to paris during summer break were he falls for a mysterious young woman he meets in the paris freak scene he then follows her in the famous <UNK> of <UNK> the hippie joint were meets wolf a man who throws hitler knives owns bars and <UNK> and keeps <UNK> under his thumb with <UNK> the couple tries to escape wolf <UNK> gets hooked with <UNK> and jealousy for <UNK> who's <UNK> and a free spirit great photography and music plot is quite usual for the period but it's not an exploitation kind of movie cold and dramatic the moral is quite strong he was looking for the sun but i would not say it's a film against drugs even it puts on drug use
<START> i was expecting a lot from mr amitabh <UNK> role of <UNK> but am disappointed being a ram <UNK> <UNK> direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie <UNK> is supposed to be a strong character but the movie shows that amitabh is too <UNK> on others power rather than his there is a movie in <UNK> called based on the theme of god father and <UNK> <UNK> has played the lead the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of <UNK> <UNK> not his son amitabh <UNK> seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father
<START> having just got the loony tunes golden collection which i highly recommend by the way i'm going to try to comment on most if not all of the cartoons <UNK> as such the starting statement might seem redundant for those whom read multiple reviews of them for this i apologize br br rabbit <UNK> is the middle short in a trilogy of like minded shorts the other two being rabbit fire and duck rabbit duck <UNK> and <UNK> argue about who elmer <UNK> should short it makes me laugh every single time on the dvd it has a commentary <UNK> option to play it music only br br my grade a br br dvd extras <UNK> 1 an introduction by chuck jones the boy of <UNK> part 1 clips from the films two guys from texas and my dream is yours both with bugs cameos <UNK> sequences for an episode of the bugs bunny show the <UNK> nuts audio recording session 2 vintage trailers <UNK> bunny bugs bunny <UNK> and a half <UNK> with <UNK> commentary with writer greg ford stills gallery
<START> i'm at a loss for words this movie is beyond description i don't believe there is a language on earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is if you do attempt to watch it be sure to stick around for the <UNK> ending i only made it about three quarters of the way through this piece of crap before i couldn't take it anymore fortunately or unfortunately a couple of my buddies stayed till the end when they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy they were able to fill me in on what i had missed this movie has no story no plot horrible writing and even worse acting if you enjoy watching train <UNK> or auto <UNK> then this film is for you i think my iq dropped about 30 points from watching this insert <UNK> here
<START> this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone it's obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this the animation is fluid detailed and superb the soundtrack isn't too memorable except for the ending song by celine <UNK> at least i think it was her the musical score is powerful full orchestra material kudos to the animators and music <UNK> 9 10 however the story and characters fall flat it feels very <UNK> there done <UNK> predictable and plain uninteresting the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable they annoyed me to no end i tried really hard to like this but i didn't care about the story it was cliché action adventure plot there were <UNK> that weren't funny it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end the dialogue was cliché and awful especially the last line it's not that gives you wings it's love whatever it was i remember cringing i was wishing it would hurry up and finish i wasn't the only one either the people i went with thought it was boring please watch the <UNK> and <UNK> film if you're going to watch any this was a waste of time
<START> carla literally <UNK> the screen in this crime caper her sex appeal ample <UNK> and sexy southern accent more than make this film but the film has so many other things to make it almost a modern classic simon <UNK> performance for one thing truly that of a great actor <UNK> <UNK> is so perfectly cast it makes me wonder why he's not a huge <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> rounds out this crew and literally steals this show other <UNK> easily the best performance in the movie emma thompson and alan <UNK> are so utterly brilliant i cannot even describe it great chemistry br br the music is so <UNK> <UNK> that it was a character in and of itself <UNK> to behold br br people may say it's tarantino influenced i disagree it's clearly unique and clever in it's own right sebastian does a wonderful job at directing this tightly woven film and <UNK> a lot of scenes that left me <UNK> the ending is perfectly sinister and you never see it coming all in all a lovely film that to me is the very definition of what a good movie should be
<START> rock star 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br rock star is the story of a nobody who becomes <UNK> into fame only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it we have seen all this before in better movies but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge it <UNK> a recommendation because of its <UNK> of the atmosphere the script by crazy beautiful director john <UNK> portrays the hard core universe with memorable images it doesn't explain what it is about it shows us br br rock star originally titled metal god stars mark <UNK> as chris <UNK> cole a <UNK> office supplies <UNK> who dreams of becoming bobby beers the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group steel dragon although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood <UNK> instead of writing his own songs he insists on performing only those by steel dragon and only in the exact way they perform them his group becomes irritated with <UNK> <UNK> and gives him the boot br br this <UNK> chris as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend emily jennifer aniston from tv's friends he then receives a phone call it's the steel dragon band they have seen <UNK> tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer in an instant chris rockets into the <UNK> world of sudden stardom from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star unfortunately it's not as rewarding as he expected br br a true story inspired the rock star concept an <UNK> supply salesman tim <UNK> <UNK> really did replace rob the lead singer in <UNK> priest after initially singing for a tribute band the rest of the film is probably fiction although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands the film details the various <UNK> of being a rock star it explores the aspects of <UNK> personality differences the danger of drug abuse and violence struggling relationships sexual freedom <UNK> and the extreme <UNK> of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high br br i have seen all of mark <UNK> movies and this is the first that has earned my affection <UNK> a former singer model has made movies like fear boogie nights three kings and most recently tim <UNK> lacking remake planet of the apes i am starting to admire the young actor more and more although he has not performed in many successful films he has taken many chances and done a variety of roles rock star is his best film to date i can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris <UNK> struggles and aspirations <UNK> truly makes rock star rock br br jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well she creates a chemistry rich relationship with chris that <UNK> audience participation it's tragic of what happens to their relationship we care about these characters a great deal br br during the film concert scenes director stephen <UNK> who also directed holy man and the live action version of 101 <UNK> creates a gripping atmosphere he captures the scenes with an intense urgency and a raw <UNK> energy the musical numbers provide the film with the best most involving scenes br br unfortunately <UNK> cannot sustain the energy and <UNK> throughout at the three quarters mark he <UNK> the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant i understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it in almost famous a much better film about rock and roll there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most <UNK> scenes here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion br br the message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story the film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination the filmmakers might as well stop everything appear on screen and say now audience the moral of the story we understand the theme but it's too <UNK> the personal discovery for <UNK> must be <UNK> br br fortunately all of this happens in the last twenty five minutes of the film hardly enough to completely destroy an entire <UNK> five minutes of a reasonably good feature rock star is not a great movie see almost famous if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll but for <UNK> mark it's a turning point in his career br br
<START> the internet is a wondrous thing is it not i am watching a taped episode of one of my all time favorite documentaries vietnam the ten thousand day war from my <UNK> in florida usa to my <UNK> in <UNK> i'm writing a review about this series and have just read another review from someone who actually lives in vietnam amazing i would like to just say that for <UNK> to make the statement that america brought the war to vietnam is one sided i know america was the main player in the west but it takes two sides to <UNK> war the <UNK> and the chinese were major arms <UNK> to the north so why mr <UNK> doesn't mention them as partially to blame is showing an ignorance well i think we all know why he doesn't mention them either ignorance from being raised in a communist system and its political dogma or because he to scared to say the truth for fear of being arrested also mr <UNK> i guess the parts about the north being the main <UNK> it whole war were not shown in your country so to blame america again shows ignorance regardless its interesting to read a review from vietnam of course that could be made up as well but i'll take that as real at least the communist east is somewhat open as far as the mini series why do i love it it doesn't focus on the american involvement solely this was a war that started 15 years before america got involved and the series covers every <UNK> of the history so thats a real plus the footage used is first rate all the vietnam war programs you see made now will use the same footage so you are not missing anything by watching this older series the date this series was made is another plus it has all the major players being interviewed which you can't do now because they are dead from old age it's a major historical reference third richard adds a very distinctive narrative voice his voice sounds as distinguished as james earl jones voice would and i think thats very <UNK> praise i don't think you could find a better war documentary ever made it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and <UNK> it to the year 1950 and <UNK> all the <UNK> and politicians on both sides of world war two it does that for the vietnam war br br ok i do see some bias its subtle a 1970's 80's style subtle bias kind of like <UNK> all things considered bias where it all seems so straight forward but when you blink you end up shaking your head in this shows case the later episodes don't throw a whole lot of light on the role of the media and propaganda in general all useful tools to influence the outcome of a war don't you think br br from an war veteran going through the same thing 30 years later
<START> this film was original in an unoriginal way although many movies have <UNK> the subject of suicide and mental <UNK> it was always about treating the patients and making them better because of the doctor's assistance in this film however we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a <UNK> girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy even though she doesn't care for happiness at all she just wants to die this was a very interestingly cute romance comedy that in nothing less than enjoyable this is a fun one to check out if you ever get the chance you just have to be open minded about the material overall i give it a 6 4 i just voted 9 to get the rating higher
<START> ever since i first encountered the divine ms as a sex <UNK> in spike lee's she's gotta have it i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well deserved is a masterpiece of understatement br br here she simply shines as the <UNK> force and hand in her community this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was phenomenal and <UNK> memories of life and times during the 50s 60s and of women like ms portrayed she was thoroughly and <UNK> accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again i first saw macy <UNK> name in the credits and went ho hum her performance was so good i didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african american culture that is very <UNK> done br br another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more <UNK> to the <UNK> of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to <UNK> that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices br br this is a worthy elegant presentation of african american life and is most <UNK> destined to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection br br i highly recommend
<START> i think i was recommended this film by the lady in the shop i was hiring it from for once she was bang on what a superb film first of all i was convinced james <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> were irish so convincing were their accents and by half way through the film i was utterly convinced steven robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure james <UNK> was also when i watched the special features on the dvd and saw both actors in their <UNK> <UNK> to say i was blown away would be an understatement i can remember all the acclaim dustin <UNK> got back in the 80's for his portrayal of <UNK> in the film man' quite frankly in my opinion of course steven <UNK> performance portrayal blows dustin right out of the water and he deserves recognition as such all in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship love relationships ever and it was made in britain ireland with home grown actors stick that in <UNK> <UNK> and smoke it hollywood
<START> i have rated this movie a 1 10 and have done this in good nature this movie is not as it seems and i don t get the point of it take the first joke for instance <UNK> that sign at the beginning to start well that was ok but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people don t get to their birthday with out <UNK> and he gets a cake now then he dies br br the jokes are just stupid they are t that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary movie br br shawn wayans written by marlon wayans written by phil written by br br but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones
<START> so you've seen the romero movies yes and you've seen <UNK> ladder right and the later <UNK> movies okay now let's make a movie out of all three only let's just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it sounds like a good idea br br this movie is terrible absolutely god awful yeah it's an indie flick who gives a crap is that a pass to make <UNK> <UNK> the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction that much is evident unfortunately for the writers they're not good at character interaction this isn't night of the living dead the characters are shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the <UNK> on set the dialogue is never interesting for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction you'd think the characters would have something more to say than what are we going to do i don't know well we've got to do something well what are we going to do i don't know we should leave let's just accept our fate no we've got to leave well let's leave then no maybe we should stay br br this isn't exaggeration there are <UNK> in this film that reach that level of <UNK> and <UNK> br br the worst thing about this movie half of it is a dream and it really has zero purpose nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie the writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both it's <UNK> ridiculous the <UNK> trick in the book and it's <UNK> insulting especially since i'm pretty sure they ripped off the idea from <UNK> ladder which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these <UNK> could ever hope to do br br and then there's the editing years of watching mtv and playing horror themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers but it's surely a sad thing they didn't realize what made the choppy editing and in those pieces of media effective in the first place in this film you will be confused often and not in the good david lynch way but in the bad wait i thought she just got killed no then who the hell was that wait who is that guy where did he come from how did they get here kind of way it's constant and consistently bad br br this movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get <UNK> with a few friends and laugh at it br br and as a final note as for the comedy people in other reviews are talking about it's all unintentional there isn't a single intentional piece of comedy in this film it's all supposed to be a big serious character study because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror concept sadly their <UNK> don't match up to their ability
<START> a tender movie that represents how our daily life is a <UNK> that causes us to change our thoughts <UNK> and emotions into people we're not this story is a love story where true emotions <UNK> i credit malcolm <UNK> warner win and <UNK> for outstanding performances a movie definitely worth seeing a holiday <UNK> that turns into an emotional turn a round i suggest seeing it
<START> this is still jolly good fun as with most of my friends we had seen this movie on hbo when we were young and then had been searching ever since for a copy of it when they finally <UNK> it a few years ago we had a midnight madness party and the movie held up well sure it's pure cheese but it's still a lot of fun if you didn't see <UNK> when you were young you might not appreciate its value today
<START> i don't know about the rest of the viewers of this movie but personally i'm dead sick and tired of steven seagal films when above the law came out it was a great action film <UNK> now in the <UNK> steven seagal plays steven seagal from above the law i get tired of seeing no character changes it's the same character time after time after time he needs change this movie was probably one of the worst action films i have ever seen calling it an action movie is giving it almost too much credit because there's too few action scenes and they're spread far apart throughout the film i guess they wanted to go for some drama but it was a meaningless try as the film portrays nothing but the regular <UNK> eyed steven seagal we've seen thousands of times over get a new look and lose the <UNK> tail is all i have to say i definitely do not recommend viewing this film in any form go out to eat heck rent barney goes to vegas but do not under any circumstances rent this movie under the <UNK> that seagal will make a great performance
<START> this is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show people say its witty and intelligence i don't see how maybe because the characters use fancy words maybe because they are <UNK> use dry humor and have 2 dimensional personalities i went to an <UNK> league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters in fact had i met someone like them i would have likely <UNK> them the men act like little emotional pre teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes the characters are no at all authentic simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated this show is just another cookie cutter hit that brain dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis
<START> kevin night of the demons is an enjoyable horror film that reminds me a little bit the evil dead on night a group of teens throws a party in <UNK> house an abandoned funeral home on the <UNK> of town lead by angela they perform a like ceremony and accidentally <UNK> the evil spirits that inhabit the place one by one the <UNK> evil force possesses the teens turning them into <UNK> demons night of the demons is a perfect horror film it is scary gory and pretty atmospheric the characters are well developed and the gore by steve johnson is pretty good there is a gruesome <UNK> a tongue being bitten off fingers shoved into eye <UNK> etc the scene where suzanne <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a tube of <UNK> through her <UNK> is a hoot give this one a look followed by two sequels
<START> ok so it's not great either but only because of how great laurel and hardy have been in the past if this film received a total <UNK> with picture quality enhanced add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice <UNK> background music then this film would truly start to take shape as it is it does have it's problems people do <UNK> it for how old the boys look <UNK> surprise they were in their 60's and had led a <UNK> however to me they still came across as having of charm and while this doesn't even come close to <UNK> the feet of their classics i gave it a 4 it's worth a watch simply because it's them to think otherwise would be
<START> the story as i understand is based on real events that can be either good or bad depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered br br in this case the results are enough to gag a <UNK> i wasn't expecting much going in <UNK> a story of rich high school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern <UNK> that is what i figured was a coming of age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training the kind in which the <UNK> sergeant says my duty is to snap you out of your <UNK> <UNK> ways well it is that in a way the kids start out as kids and end up as an <UNK> group but this is far <UNK> than any boot camp movie i've ever seen outside of a deliberate comedy who wrote this thing the air is filled with <UNK> that belong not in high school but in the third grade the dialog <UNK> the ear br br jeff bridges usually does a better than average job but in this case his performance is mediocre he brings nothing extra to the part although given his lines it's hard to know how he could do much with them the rest of the cast is <UNK> and a few of the kids are painfully <UNK> there's a lot of <UNK> up and considerable crying the best scene involves a <UNK> br br the immature clichés continue to the very end the coast guard is cast in the role of the hard hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster the <UNK> does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his <UNK> and of events you let the crew drink alcohol didn't you a couple of harmless drinks and you didn't <UNK> them though you <UNK> them for killing a fish the <UNK> business the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky what is a white anyway and if it's as dangerous as bridges claims why weren't the whole crew <UNK> and wearing life <UNK> but why go on if the <UNK> were a it would still be <UNK> and sunk by the ludicrous comic book script
<START> a <UNK> watch but one of <UNK> finest films interesting to compare this with the hour of the wolf as both feature the same lead actors as artists or an artist and his wife who have taken <UNK> on an island in the earlier film it's largely inner demons that lead to von <UNK> personality at least that's how i read it whereas here it's very much circumstances beyond his control br br much has been written about the unsympathetic central characters particularly von <UNK> for me there are flashes of a good if flawed man early in the film but one who <UNK> badly with <UNK> the flaws become all that is left as his humanity is gradually <UNK> by one horror after another br br i watched a passion and von <UNK> on their island again soon after this and was amazed to <UNK> many of the same locations and then there's a dream sequence
<START> completely agree with other review br br i watched this movie for about 5 minutes i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower br br the quality of the filming is beyond low budget it doesn't even look like a freaking movie if i were watching <UNK> <UNK> footage from a documentary i would expect it br br in summary avoid avoid avoid <UNK> <UNK> gate br br completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or <UNK> it
<START> kingdom county <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lord rip torn lives with his indian mate <UNK> in the area where a large <UNK> is to be built <UNK> however is not willing to give up on his land and he'll have to fight the <UNK> company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction br br where the rivers flow north is a gripping <UNK> story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn recently seen in the small but <UNK> role of louis <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> underrated marie <UNK> and <UNK> dances with wolves smoke <UNK> director jay craven who also co wrote the script with don based on howard frank novel and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique <UNK> pace visuals which remind me of <UNK> <UNK> and john <UNK> best moments it's an underrated independent period piece of the first electric half of the 90's usually regarded as the rise of quentin <UNK> <UNK> pulp fiction is a masterpiece indeed but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome todd disturbing <UNK> danny <UNK> dark vision of the uk let's not mention that beach flick with <UNK> though jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well he's been leading a <UNK> <UNK> career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his br br my vote 8 10
<START> i wouldn't have given this film such a low rating 2 if its average hadn't been ridiculously high but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable i sat through most of this film watching scene after scene of <UNK> and <UNK> no dialog just <UNK> and <UNK> finally the two <UNK> something happened but then back to <UNK> and <UNK> i left the screening i recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious film making i disliked the directors previous film a self righteous defense of man boy love but at least that film had a story interesting characters dialog the <UNK> artist had only scene after scene of <UNK> and <UNK> i want more from a film than this
<START> paul <UNK> <UNK> on this film the writing direction casting and acting with the exception of <UNK> are all off the mark i remember the reviews from 20 years ago being mediocre but i thought it still might be worthwhile to view with <UNK> such as susan sarandon <UNK> julia who overacts in most of his scenes and john cassavetes i understandably expected much more the music picked for the film is jarring the cuts between new york and <UNK> confusing and the overall pace all leave much to be desired why paul <UNK> felt the need to update this story or add his touch to it is puzzling this retelling of <UNK> and his daughter takes very little of <UNK> from the play and adds not much more the play is not one of shakespeare's best anyway and to gut it even further seems not to be a good decision unfortunately there is nothing to recommend in this film
<START> this documentary <UNK> the origins and life of the <UNK> team using original film shot in the 1970s mostly by craig combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today br br the first part of the film documents how the <UNK> section of <UNK> <UNK> came to be starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a <UNK> italy like european city by the 1970's the one remaining local attraction the pacific ocean park had been abandoned leaving a beach with lots of exposed <UNK> and other <UNK> the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf and they <UNK> despite or perhaps because of their surroundings because the waves <UNK> in the afternoon they took up <UNK> to fill their time and the empty swimming <UNK> caused by the <UNK> during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the <UNK> <UNK> style that is mainstream today br br i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or <UNK> before i watched the film the soundtrack not surprisingly was good as well i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create which seemed somewhat forced and the <UNK> somewhat sense of self importance although this is probably just left over street attitude from where they grew up this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well br br one note my wife is more affected than most to <UNK> when films use what we refer to as <UNK> camera movements this film is often guilty so if you are so <UNK> be warned br br i would recommend this film to anyone but especially to anyone with <UNK> and or surfing in their history br br seen on 5 11 2002
<START> this is a fact that this is the 1st <UNK> feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in <UNK> <UNK> for a simple reason we don't have cinema theaters in our large kingdom not only one cinema theater the government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the <UNK> <UNK> or the religious police or both asked for closing it in the late 1970s the early 1980s <UNK> the <UNK> art with <UNK> wrong sex relationships and stuff like that i don't see a powerful reason why we don't open cinema theaters we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom we watch movies in the tv from some satellite channels we can <UNK> the showtime set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways i know many people how go to <UNK> countries only to watch a couple of films i personally went to <UNK> several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town this is one of the problems that we are having br br the movie is produced and presented by filmed entertainment which is a major company belongs to the <UNK> <UNK> prince bin the <UNK> <UNK> man in the world br br the movie's title is a word means literally how are you but it is also a <UNK> means what's up sometimes used as a <UNK> to say bad about something and sometimes is used as a <UNK> to tell someone <UNK> to mind his business not to <UNK> in someone else's affairs anyway i think they meant how are you what's up in the same time i could be wrong though br br male actors are from <UNK> <UNK> like who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in <UNK> <UNK> show more like american idol he works in some tv programs like the <UNK> version of cash taxi the other famous actor is <UNK> who is funny and has a very good sense of humor other actors like al al and ali al are less famous and they work on some tv series shows female actresses are non and they did a very good job speaking the <UNK> accent <UNK> actress <UNK> in leading role actress al not that we don't have <UNK> actresses but are few and not that good br br a <UNK> critic al who writes for newspaper the most popular newspaper in the kingdom wrote about it saying lets not expect much of the 1st <UNK> feature film it was born in unusual circumstances therefore we can't judge it under the usual standards like any other film it is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in kingdom of <UNK> the movie is fresh and is about a <UNK> family deals <UNK> with controversial fresh issues inside the <UNK> society like women driving cars the low shallow thoughts about the arts the of the society by a certain group the differences between being conservative and being an <UNK> the ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie one of the movie's <UNK> is the beautiful music score by which was good but sometimes it doesn't match or express what's in the picture al did a great job his performance was the best alongside with <UNK> the biggest loser is the leading actor who came behind the supporting actors al ali al and <UNK> who did a good job within the limits of their roles br br after all al hal even with all of its <UNK> still an ok movie and it is a very good 1st step of and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong <UNK> inside the <UNK> society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the <UNK> art and other arts br br ps there is another <UNK> filmmaker <UNK> claims that he directed the 1st <UNK> movie titled shadows of silence br br i haven't seen the movie yet i hope i've been helpful
<START> i loved this movie when i was younger and i have actually been looking for it again i would love to watch it again the information is all correct but the cover doesn't look like it would match i can't say for sure though from what i remember the movie was about these kids <UNK> <UNK> tina etc in a driving class and it also shows the <UNK> they get into outside the class edie <UNK> was <UNK> mother in the movie i remember i really liked it so if anyone knows where i can get a copy preferably dvd of the movie listed above with those stars in it i would love to know thank you
<START> just what the world needed another superficial cookie cutter mary kate and ashley olsen movie this movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere complete with stereotypical junior high experience they make learning anything at all seem completely taboo i can't stand the fake french accents or those guys on the <UNK> racing around who eventually fall for the twins why am i putting everything in <UNK> because its all stereotyped the twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather they should be happy they even have a grandfather at all how does this fit the mary kate ashley mold this one has them <UNK> up a single guy who gasp isn't their father yes folks they actually have a mother who appears for all of five seconds i haven't even sat through thirty minutes of this and i can already tell how it will end up this movie is so pitiful it makes miss usa seem like an academic bowl really
<START> this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it like battlefield earth or 3000 miles to <UNK> the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3 4 of the way through the movie when they strip the <UNK> cops to their <UNK> and <UNK> them in the park in a <UNK> position beyond that the jokes aren't funny the characters aren't funny their <UNK> and <UNK> aren't funny add it up it's not a very funny movie not even at a slapstick level and what's with the <UNK> soundtrack it's a movie about two white <UNK> and the music is all <UNK> seems out of place don't it if you like a good <UNK> this is for you if you like a good comedy look elsewhere
<START> fascinating look behind the scenes about how a really good movie can get made if the producers director cast simply refuse to quit these guys encountered serious obstacles throughout the two years of the project <UNK> budget trouble with the script and with the script writer so the finished product wasn't what was first <UNK> but probably turned out to be more interesting than the movie they set out to make which goes to show that the punk mentality of just do it with or without any backing money or help figure it out on the fly and do what you want to do i really liked this documentary movie and know that viewers will see and learn things they didn't know before this movie is truly one of a kind it's hard to <UNK> because it has pieces of sci fi and suspense and also how to make a movie it tells the truth about how films get made what can go wrong and how to overcome i especially liked the music written by ed these guys know how to produce a good movie on a shoe string because they're creative and know how to build props <UNK> staging lighting with what they can up pretty amazing stuff
<START> my website <UNK> lists michael as one of the worst films of the modern era the following is an <UNK> br br everyone <UNK> some time in their lives this was <UNK> turn i still don't know what the point of this terrible film was nora has proved to be a competent writer and director so what the hell happened here the <UNK> michael takes a new spin here and is portrayed as a ham <UNK> chain smoking sugar addicted <UNK> <UNK> whose biggest contribution to humanity after sending <UNK> to hell was that he invented standing in line yes how funny and charming i don't find this offensive i find it stupid in its defense i can say that the ending was ever bit unsatisfying as the rest of this painful attempt at story telling
<START> ok i'm italian but there aren't so many italian film like this i think that the plot is very good for 3 4 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but it's the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack i'd like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is a great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but it's only a great theater italian actor called toni yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it's too slow it's so boring so many <UNK> but i think that this <UNK> its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl the grand daughter of the italian actress anna <UNK> olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films
<START> i have enjoyed both of the van <UNK> over the years and was glad to watch them again br br just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy br br dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older br br son <UNK> has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps br br together they make a great team and work well together br br i am disappointed that i have not found another murder 101 listed anywhere br br i have seen both of the ones that have been shown i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch br br you can sure tell <UNK> follows in his dad footsteps they talk alike and have the same mannerisms br br would enjoy anything they do <UNK> br br will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together
<START> leslie excellent book on the tells the whole story of the <UNK> big move of their entire animation unit to florida and their subsequent <UNK> by paramount br br mr bug goes to town didn't destroy the animation credit with paramount although it's often told that way and this was <UNK> favorite version of the story according to the big studio more than anything wanted to get their <UNK> on the animation studio and ease the <UNK> <UNK> brothers out of the picture altogether mr bug provided them the <UNK> to do just that the sad closing of a great quirky innovative chapter in american animation br br i wanted to comment also that the film actually <UNK> december 4 1941 not december 7 that may have been close enough to do the trick anyway in terms of national mood <UNK> the film's success but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time <UNK> released october 23 1941 was still doing very <UNK> holiday business i haven't done the research into box office numbers but i'd say that <UNK> presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr bug movie going was at an all time high at this period and successful films could go strong in theaters for months something <UNK> in these typically short run quick to dvd days
<START> i saw this film knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars chris <UNK> and david spade and i have to say that this film is a comic classic it is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious <UNK> is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his <UNK> right hand man the equally excellent spade to find the funding to save the families business relax put your brain on auto pilot and <UNK> up the fun a great supporting cast features film favourites such as brian <UNK> <UNK> rob lowe wayne's world and bo derek 10 highly recommended for a good laugh
<START> is a pretty funny episode of south park it spoofs al gore and his speeches on global warming only replacing global warming with a fictional monster who has parts of a man a bear and a pig he tells the boys about it in a school <UNK> and stan feels sorry for him so he and the boys decide to hang out with him gore eventually gets them trapped in a rock cave where he believes to be and they are stuck for days meanwhile <UNK> finds treasure but wants to keep it all to himself is a good spoof on global warming and overall a funny south park episode br br 8 10
<START> wwii veterans return home and find it hard to <UNK> to <UNK> life this superb drama is expertly directed by <UNK> and beautifully filmed by famed cinematographer despite its near three hour length it does not drag for a minute the script by <UNK> features very human characters and great dialog andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet also good are wright as a love sick young woman <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> wife and real life veteran russell as a man who lost both his hands however top <UNK> go to march and loy as a long married couple facing challenges while getting <UNK> with each other
<START> yes a real stinker i saw this movie on the advice of my sweet friends who told me that this is a great psychological movie this film makes every effort not to be understandable i was aware that i was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutes i waited since i expected to see something valuable and most important of all i paid for this film the wait was unbearable after seeing the film i talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual <UNK> they call themselves under this title of turkey this movie had <UNK> as a masterpiece yes a masterpiece but in the category of <UNK> i think that a movie must be self <UNK> this film is just the opposite keep away from this thing which calls itself a movie burn your money instead of paying for this phenomenon rate 1 out of 10
<START> i watched this movie again yesterday with a 20 year old <UNK> from my office ok it was the quiet day after <UNK> and we both loved it i love the unique plot david duchovny david allen <UNK> and the way the dog keeps waiting at the door isn't part of each of us just like that dog after someone we love dies br br i also love the old folks at the restaurant they remind me of some of the older people around southern new england where your ethnic group is a very important topic of discussion and i love the wedding at the end br br <UNK> driver is great in this movie and bonnie hunt should have won an award for everything br br bonnie make more movies
<START> this short was nominated for an academy award losing to anna and <UNK> not since doctor <UNK> has nuclear war been so hilarious takes a situation and turns it on its ear and then gives it a spin for good measure visual gags abound in work and i always see something i missed before every time i watch this on the world's greatest animation well worth seeing for many other shorts recommended
<START> i like and <UNK> la <UNK> so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for <UNK> 99 in it is <UNK> debut scripted film penned by himself and brandon and stars the entire crew ryan <UNK> himself <UNK> don <UNK> etc etc brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction which is one of the film's greatest merits its quite in its colour style but also shows progression br br basically it follows very loosely ryan <UNK> break up with girlfriend played by played by <UNK> named after by any chance and <UNK> play his best mates who <UNK> havoc by doing various stunts br br its a bit like the films but with a linear storyline which is very basic indeed and poor acting its strange the usually super gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next br br the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part but the second half of the film is much better than the first 90 mins is a stretch for the flick though and there are a number of redeeming factors such as tony <UNK> cameo sub plots such as 'the invention <UNK> and 'the diamond the soundtrack is also very strong its not all and him in fact <UNK> steal the film in terms of its use of music in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real especially since don <UNK> has a fairly prominent role in the latter part and he seems to steal every scene he is in br br the film will appeal to those who like the antics but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line <UNK> oh and will someone tell <UNK> that <UNK> montages especially in films is <UNK> 1998 br br however the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film but the 40 mins <UNK> <UNK> doc br br the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with and the <UNK> real feelings towards each other amazing <UNK> as usual <UNK> comes across as a bit of a dick especially towards drink problem and ryan <UNK> comes across as a really nice down to earth guy the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend who is an <UNK> member trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the household with the crew and a caring side of gang ape and ryan really comes across a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd br br for <UNK> 99 i'm very although i hope <UNK> stays to the improvised and short skits from now on
<START> this movie is an <UNK> <UNK> attempt to <UNK> together several bad movies and make some sort of extra bad movie it fails at even this since there's way too much plot and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore seriously the puppets are sweet and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good the performances are c grade at best and lame throughout with special props to the <UNK> <UNK> guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast <UNK> that was almost impossible to <UNK> not that you really care what he says as only the curse words are distinct <UNK> it's non offensive pretty much what you'd expect from low rent straight to video <UNK> just like the script the fact that new <UNK> used footage from the <UNK> films is offensive and quite confusing for shame new <UNK> for shame <UNK> is one of my favorite terrible movies and they somehow screwed it up and made it <UNK> unwatchable see the <UNK> films if you want to see <UNK> dinosaur mayhem br br i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from and also because the scale doesn't have a zero
<START> this is a movie you'll either love or hate i loved it if you are looking for suspense great special effects action sophistication cynicism etc you won't find it in this movie it is a feel good movie sentimental positive uplifting the heroes of the movie are coach jones played by ed harris a man of strength and integrity and radio cuba gooding jr a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world i guess i didn't find this movie to be sentimental <UNK> as so many did because it felt very real to me i know people like these i've seen <UNK> who think it's fun to pick on the vulnerable i've seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable i've seen people who think high school football is serious business i've seen people who know what really is important in life any of these people could have been people i knew i did laugh i did cry i left the movie feeling good remembering that there are people like coach jones and radio in my world if there aren't people like them in yours you might not like the movie if you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature you'll hate it
<START> very good film very good documentary br br very good to see those <UNK> detectives <UNK> and found out as the <UNK> <UNK> heartless their one eyed parents community and environment raised them as br br i tip my <UNK> to pat can we get this decent human being on some kind of <UNK> <UNK> or investigation we need his integrity <UNK> intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the <UNK> game that is world politics and big business br br all the animals come out at night <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> queens <UNK> <UNK> sick <UNK> someday a real rain will come and wash all this <UNK> off the streets pat should be the first drops of that real rain the people who control this earth are animals they need to be drowned br br i'm just in shock walking the night is scary business the <UNK> howling and <UNK> is of detectives in murder on a sunday morning in pat blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning br br it is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the <UNK> play a <UNK> game to see justice done and to see every <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like the pathetic human rats they are br br how does it feel you <UNK> <UNK> fingers of the law how does it feel to have your <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK> confession your <UNK> detective work found out for what it really was how does it feel br br i hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed <UNK>
<START> it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and <UNK> were all deserving of death br br this movie like the others of that era <UNK> to bring this about and the viewer knows this there is no mystery or suspense the people <UNK> but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughable br br the five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts everyone is nuts so that the director writer team can justify their nazi propaganda br br for some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any <UNK> man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not men br br totally crap and totally depressing
<START> here's another antonioni that will be <UNK> again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or dvd i saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in <UNK> movie capital l a for a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have <UNK> for their own special territory where older favorites like antonioni and <UNK> are only welcome as occasional br br at first i was disappointed thought the pace to be <UNK> boring and that the man had lost a chance for years antonioni had found it difficult to find <UNK> at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his <UNK> but knowing antonioni for what he was and how i had at first <UNK> to blow up and the passenger i refused to pass judgment until i had seen the film again i went back the next day and i should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things i had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in ' <UNK> an environment of subtle <UNK> so and <UNK> <UNK> in tone and quite comedic actually that i couldn't get enough the scene with <UNK> sitting on the fancy colored <UNK> on the <UNK> beach with the weather so beautifully silver and the <UNK> track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great what a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which <UNK> eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate the odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a <UNK> porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the <UNK> gorgeous sophie and <UNK> of other international stars to distract you this film is <UNK> <UNK> to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm for example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something i did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings 4 before they pulled it and would've gone back for more if this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it i have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of <UNK> '60s films but the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a <UNK> dvd version if and when it's released i urge all film nuts general or <UNK> to see <UNK> the and add a piece of magic to the tragic
<START> great story great music a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to too bad there is no soundtrack cd
<START> though not hal hartley's best work my personal favorite is surviving desire there is still much to like about this movie especially for fans of hartley's dialogues even to audiences new to hartley i would definitely recommend this movie over the <UNK> dogma this movie is more intelligent <UNK> to its source material the bible and more fun than any of the other pre millennium apocalypse movies br br this movie is actually part of the french 2000 as seen by 2000 par <UNK> series as such it is perhaps even a lower budget film than hartley's other works while the need for simple scenes shot with digital camera is understandable in this context the main problem with this movie is the unfortunate <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> effect i'd be happy to never see this effect used in a movie again especially at the beginning it almost makes the movie unwatchable but overlook this flaw and you'll be treated to a fine film especially notable is played by p j harvey relating how jesus saved her from being stoned to death a short scene i found surprisingly moving despite the fact that it was not mary <UNK> that this happened to the woman in the bible was <UNK> br br
<START> tom <UNK> was my brother so i went to see the movie and i never looked at it again in all these years sorry it was bad i'm told i have to write 10 lines so i'll put a little trivia in tom and <UNK> <UNK> were to be introduced in this picture and tom was told to take <UNK> to the premiere but tom said no he was going with joan collins and he did and because he did only <UNK> <UNK> was introduced i found this very funny back then and still do the movie while the concept was a funny one and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just <UNK> come out funny the continuity was abstract at best it was like i was watching 2 different movies at the same time each running into the other sorry bob <UNK>
<START> this is one of those films with a great potential brilliant actors a debut from a very interesting director and a haunting survivor ish plot br br but it does not work at all br br to start with the good thing the cinematography is stunning the beauty of the desert shows itself as a <UNK> surrounding also in the pictures and then there is the acting quite <UNK> jennifer jason leigh has never been better bruce <UNK> also seems to have developed his character from altman's short cuts br br then the <UNK> janet <UNK> and the plot why on earth does pick <UNK> for their play the whole idea of letting shakespeare <UNK> their despair and inner <UNK> does not work it seems like a <UNK> and it is clear that the <UNK> takes place because of the choice of <UNK> they just needs to fit in in the script by and academy award winner <UNK> thomas <UNK> br br and the sex it takes about three days then more or less all of the characters are sexually frustrated sex is always the easy way out when you are in need of a crisis in a plot janet <UNK> part totally falls apart mainly because of that ridiculous idea the sex makes the plot fall promptly to the ground instead they could have focused on the dialogue there must have been conversation between all of the characters but we mainly see them talking in smaller groups their talking though is as dead as <UNK> and the rest of the film br br the king is alive still is not the worst danish <UNK> <UNK> movie yet but comparing it to the most recent of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> films for by lone this one fails badly it is not a good film it is a bad one but it is beautiful
<START> man are you serious did you read the book or watch this movie well if you did let me warn you it is bogus mark has been seeking a job since losing his job with the <UNK> you remember him don't you he was the guy that <UNK> on the stand and gave the <UNK> simpson defense a <UNK> they were looking for well he has written three books since then i have read all three of them no i am not a fan they were given to me however i will tell you one similarity in all three they grossly <UNK> the importance of mark he shamelessly <UNK> his stature in all three in murder in <UNK> he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer when he had nothing to do with it in all books he takes great delight in running down local law <UNK> efforts kind of like his efforts were run down in the <UNK> trial in this movie there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at and <UNK> after him many other shots have him at the center of attention when in reality i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was hey isn't that the racist that caused <UNK> to get off this was an interesting real life story but not a good movie over it
<START> if you like movies that will make you think this is absolutely one of the good ones i always liked david lynch and <UNK> they have always made high quality movies br br has directed k <UNK> brilliantly the movie tears in feelings and philosophy of the mind and world kevin spacey and jeff bridges both delivers superb acting skills it caught me i did not take my eyes away from the screen during the movie on the other hand if you are hoping for a special effect sci fi movie this is not for you the story is being dragged a bit which can be a bit boring but also works as a way of building up the theme of the movie br br enjoy this film i did
<START> the film is visually stunning from the dusty interior of the church with the <UNK> <UNK> through the street and the run down garage to the <UNK> that is the climax of the film it also has a wonderful sense of time both 1950's the film's opening and 1960's all of the performances are top class especially <UNK> <UNK> as the psychotic preacher and gerard as the father who finds his own <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by his son what a pity then that the story is so ridiculous for a start in <UNK> on the relationship between gabriel and his family it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community in the church we see five or six of the main characters at the front and another two or three at the back but the rest of the <UNK> might as well be <UNK> they show no sign of hearing him <UNK> him or <UNK> from him at the <UNK> nobody says <UNK> or <UNK> when he <UNK> the proceedings but neither does anybody applaud or <UNK> when caroline throws a <UNK> over him a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the <UNK> of <UNK> pains secondly which isn't actually a town but a tiny village seems to lack some essential services such as police and fire service murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a <UNK> residents watch an <UNK> that threatens to <UNK> the whole town as though they were at the cinema for that matter everyday things such as <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> absent the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or <UNK> fields and most puzzling of all for a <UNK> north of ireland setting there is only one christian community not even a couple of to season the mix even if you're willing to suspend disbelief the story itself is pretty <UNK> a pale imitation of an a j melodrama and the music well it's beautiful for the first two minutes but when the same four <UNK> are repeated non stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating my advice watch this with the sound off
<START> one of the worst movies i've seen this year everything about the film screams amateur for a movie set in the <UNK> everybody speaks like it's the 1990's the acting particularly the people playing the white slave masters is horrible after about an hour into this movie i walked out what a waste of time and effort for a much better film on this subject see steven spielberg's far superior <UNK>
<START> this movie is amazing you will never laugh harder it's a target no i think it's yes it's a <UNK> this movie gets funnier by the second like when jackie chan's character finally dies in his final fight scene this movie is like <UNK> if you buy or rent this you'll never return it in my opinion i didn't and i haven't found it in a store since i watched this movie once and i was forever in love with kung fu action flicks if you're looking for an amazing film in the realm of great production value good or even mediocre acting and good special effects this is not that movie if you're looking for laughs and timeless <UNK> pick this up for a dollar and you'll probably never let it go with friends popcorn and drinks it's the perfect evening
<START> the essential message one which miller would have surely intended after seeing <UNK> war crimes trials is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life meat <UNK> character fred has known lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes at the <UNK> of his <UNK> supporters he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their target group for me this is the crucial message it doesn't matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point <UNK> they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason animal <UNK> and anger have <UNK> <UNK> union thugs to reality br br a friend of mine suggested i should see the wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them <UNK> it i once <UNK> an experiment in a role playing game and was shocked to see how normal and level headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state which would ultimate <UNK> them all because it <UNK> in in stages br br fred is the start his la friends and preacher idol are the <UNK> which pushes his <UNK> over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong br br the relationship between lawrence and the jewish <UNK> is a fascinating one because lawrence misses the point almost until the end if the <UNK> force out where is he to go if his family have <UNK> the nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedom br br that big poster it's a fairly famous propaganda piece about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail when you see this film watch for the <UNK> on the subway train and all the little posters the message <UNK> there too br br this movie should be on the <UNK> of every school especially in our time when <UNK> hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just <UNK> in thin <UNK>
<START> police squad 1982 was a funny show that ended too soon but i guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many american television shows the geniuses behind this funny show were the team of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> every since his straight act in the comedy hit airplane leslie <UNK> has found a new career as a comedian in this short lived t v series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more the bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending but lt leslie <UNK> got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed br br <UNK> bad they never released this on d v d if a show needed to be re released it would have to be this one a whole new generation is waiting to see this show br br highly recommended
<START> the stunts sequences as well as the special effects are brilliant in this movie michael must be one of best stunt co of all time the explosion in the <UNK> is a wonderful combination of stunts special effects and visual effects the director had an idea that the crew managed to create on film br br besides that donald sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film
<START> this came as a huge surprise for me i had never heard of this movie when i first saw it and the title really pointed towards something else than a great terrorist hostage situation at a high school toy soldiers has the best from it's time period of the early 90's where action movies were light hearted and very enjoyable the action is good the plot is interesting and way over the top the bad guy is a one dimensional hateful <UNK> which is great louis <UNK> jr is in it it's simply a feel good movie which i thoroughly enjoyed br br you can't go wrong with this one if you like action i give it a solid rating of 8 10
<START> this movie is truly unbelievable in every sense of the word i couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing and i didn't believe it anyhow hepburn is probably my favorite actress but this was ridiculous being a <UNK> myself i know what it should sound like and it's not <UNK> back bay accent the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times sydney <UNK> was cast as another one of the <UNK> with accent to match maybe this was a practical joke come to think of it i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting well maybe this i noticed that natalie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> island appeared in this play on broadway can you imagine what part she might have played
<START> x m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons br br 1 it is one the first and the few movies not to have a happy ending <UNK> the effect was more profound in post world war ii america than it would be today but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message br br 2 it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion using space as a valid setting for drama the lack of scientific background notwithstanding the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare it's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space br br 3 the anti nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in <UNK> involving large <UNK> men or animal the effect of martian society from nuclear <UNK> is <UNK> and frankly presented the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to <UNK> the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending br br <UNK> says take a ride on x m
<START> this film has gone in and out of fashion more often than the <UNK> a triumph in the post war period it was virtually forgotten by the 1970s except by students of cinema recently it has begun to get recognition as perhaps the most even handed representation of <UNK> <UNK> into post war life ever made and that most definitely includes films such as the deer hunter i like it but my overall <UNK> is somewhere between those extremes br br the tale is a simple one three very different <UNK> who have <UNK> out after world war ii the big one fly home to their <UNK> town and try to resume or create <UNK> lives one has a <UNK> one has a <UNK> job waiting for him and the other has nothing to go on but determination br br there are some good but unfortunately uneven performances march won the best actor oscar for playing an old sergeant who returns to his job at the local bank personally i think jimmy stewart deserved it for it's a wonderful life which also deserved the best picture award but clearly this film touched a nerve with the post war audience as i said it was <UNK> march has one fantastic scene a humorous speech that brought to mind somewhat similar incident involving real wwii hero <UNK> and otherwise is solid but <UNK> br br i am going against the grain here but i thought that myrna loy who played <UNK> wife was <UNK> ignored by the academy i <UNK> barely a hint of warmth from her in fact i kept thinking she was going to slap <UNK> march for annoying her she practically every time they were together something was definitely missing there in her forced smiles and her air of tolerance rather than i think all this nonsense about her being the perfect wife is correct only if you think a <UNK> 1950s <UNK> is your ideal you may disagree with that but the academy voters apparently did not she is a major problem with this film terribly miscast br br dana andrews as a former <UNK> jerk who became a war hero then winds up behind the counter again is amazing he is <UNK> with a wife who evidently married him right before he left for the war for all the wrong reasons and his future looks bleak but then he chances upon <UNK> daughter peggy <UNK> wright in a fantastic turn and fireworks explode both are great but then comes that <UNK> again that <UNK> this film some moments of pure soap opera <UNK> <UNK> by the all time classic line i'm going to bust that marriage up the romance is uplifting and does mirror a common condition after the war that of returning <UNK> finding love upon their return br br speaking of uplifting now we come to harold russell he has a <UNK> quality to his acting or is it non acting that rings just as true today as it no doubt did then taking a no nonsense approach to his situation he is an inspiration his best scene one of the best in all cinema is when he brings the girl who likes him up to his bedroom to show her the truth of his condition i'm lucky i still have my <UNK> unlike some of the boys truly great stuff br br the film has some moments that <UNK> it also has some moments that belong in the afternoon <UNK> take the good with the bad and see this one for the high points
<START> this movie was a <UNK> to inept filmmaking on a <UNK> scale i'm a huge burt reynolds fan but even he was horrible in this film the only redeeming quality of this film was the chick that <UNK> all the time she was kind of attractive to look at otherwise what a waste of time and energy
<START> if you want a film with the full range of emotion look no further dramatic and funny and scenes of wrenching emotion i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without <UNK> a tear now and then the acting by the two leads is hard to believe you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular <UNK> <UNK> and cerebral <UNK> michael quite simply two of the finest performances i have ever seen these are two very believable characters as well and you never have the feeling things have just been tossed in for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy in the dvd release as extras they have deleted scenes including an alternate ending and an extended party sequence why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous but without <UNK> i can <UNK> recommend this film to anyone one of the very best i have ever seen
<START> as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old i adore <UNK> it is a movie that contains no double <UNK> no almost swear words like heck or darn no parents who are <UNK> idiots and no <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> jokes that are so prevalent in even the best kids movies these days the story line is sweet and interesting the music is great the love story is quite romantic the <UNK> are adorable and the various other characters are unique and attention capturing the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing the characters are quite well cast as well i love listening to eva <UNK> voice and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well it's really a movie about love tolerance good manners and <UNK> who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one
<START> when people <UNK> on about how they don't make 'em like they used to then just point them towards this fantastically entertaining and quaint looking comedy horror from writer director glenn br br it's a tale of played by dominic <UNK> and larry <UNK> who end up digging up more than just silent <UNK> corpses after the initial shock of this they soon realise that they can actually turn the situation to their advantage and that's just what they try to do mind you it seems as if things may not have worked out quite as they planned as poor young arthur <UNK> is actually relating his tale to a priest ron <UNK> before being taken to the <UNK> br br looking at the detail of his filmography seems to have taken the core of his first short movie and expanded it to this feature effort which is no bad thing <UNK> returns and does well <UNK> is one of those guys who can actually still get you to like him while he goes about the <UNK> business of stealing from the dead and with other genre favourites such as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on the scene this film is a lot of fun for genre fans br br it also benefits from a unique and <UNK> design and look at times moving from e c comic style <UNK> into live action a la <UNK> and always somehow feeling quite authentic in it's hammer horror feel maybe everything is just covered over with so much dry ice but that's beside the point whatever was done to capture everything on film it works it works well br br it may not have any actual scares but this film does have a great vein of black humour and definitely <UNK> every minute of it's runtime in macabre material that should please all of those who have the patience for horror that's a little bit more <UNK> and feels like it definitely could have been made back in the days of hammer br br see this if you like the flesh and the <UNK> the doctor and the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham <UNK> offering little <UNK> perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for <UNK> but plays out as a <UNK> history special with clunky self <UNK> informative dialog and sub par acting even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this <UNK> albeit historically worthy melodrama paying no mind to the often distracting <UNK> with the actors to the reality of situations on screen and you should be left with an informative if somewhat <UNK> educational lesson in <UNK> post war history
<START> i think this movie is the most misunderstood film in jerry lewis career it's little slow starting but after it gets going is very funny <UNK> use of irony like never before in his earlier films ie who's <UNK> the store the nutty professor etc the idea is clear it's a mock of the dirty dozen instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film you have 4 4 <UNK> 2 tag <UNK> including the former l a <UNK> all star willie davis as hilarious love that movie
<START> certainly expected more after seeing the cast list but wow br br i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like john made it <UNK> me to no end somehow the budget allowed them to secure a <UNK> of d list actors whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half the unknown actors were just plain awful less steve who does a decent job as <UNK> the story is so bad that it really needs no mention the overall production value seems standard with some above average camera work if you can make it through the god awful <UNK> mo scenes and the painful person on fire sequences i knew it would be dumb i just had no idea how dumb and unfortunately it's time spent that can never be returned to me i suppose if you enjoy really bad b films this might work for you but if you value any story at all this one is simply dreadful a complete waste of time
<START> this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen the part where they loose there daughter with the <UNK> <UNK> rip off just pushes it over the edge with stupidity i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft core porn scenes in it i have to say it made me laugh my ass off the 80's 3d effects were very out of place included an invisible cat and a spinning <UNK> wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest <UNK> of time and money i have ever seen
<START> let me say from the outset i'm not a particular fan of this kind of film but holds a certain fascination for me with a message about perspective br br back in the old days the folks who inhabit would have been called zombies the undead and according to what clive barker has given us certain members of human kind in this craig <UNK> are born with the potential to become part of that world br br psychiatrist david <UNK> at first looking like the mild mannered professional has taken <UNK> himself a <UNK> mission to rid the world of the he tricks the police into killing <UNK> but <UNK> goes to a graveyard named cemetery where the <UNK> and live underground br br <UNK> has also left a girl friend anne bobby who still has feelings for him even after he's been killed and is now one of the undead she tries in her own small way to be a bridge to <UNK> br br clive <UNK> creatures are a pretty gruesome looking lot and are not particularly fond of humans but it's plain to see that if humans left them alone the in turn not bother with them br br your <UNK> are definitely with the especially after seeing a fanatic like <UNK> and redneck police chief charles <UNK> in action br br clive <UNK> been an out gay man for some time now and some have suggested to me that the is a metaphor for gay people i can see where that would come in especially since there are a whole lot of people who don't even think of gays as anything human because they're taught that way br br granted is pretty bloody with a lot of gratuitous violence but it also does make you think and i do like the way clive barker does turn traditional <UNK> on its head and makes craig <UNK> a kind of <UNK> for the creatures
<START> it's a rare sensation to come across a film so embarrassing that you feel an urge to turn away from the screen but when you see a noble actor like sir john gielgud surrounded by naked <UNK> couples that's just what you'll want to do add to that peter o'toole as <UNK> ridden emperor and malcolm mcdowell sticking his finger up a male <UNK> <UNK> and you begin to appreciate that <UNK> is solely of interest to <UNK> of sick outrageous films br br the film <UNK> the life of notorious roman emperor <UNK> mcdowell a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters <UNK> <UNK> murders incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes br br although <UNK> was totally mad in real life and probably did <UNK> to his base instincts more often than not the film is still <UNK> filth the sex in the film isn't used as one aspect in a multi layered story the sex is the story after a while all the nudity hip <UNK> and <UNK> sucking becomes tedious due to sheer <UNK> the performances are totally <UNK> particularly mcdowell who throws caution to the wind and gives a performance that is all wild eyed <UNK> o'toole seems to be treating the script with the contempt it deserves surely he's in it purely for the money <UNK> abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's <UNK> during post production but in truth there isn't a single minute in <UNK> that is <UNK> or well made it is <UNK> that this amount of time talent and money will ever be thrown at a porno film again so in that sense <UNK> is a one of a kind experience on the other hand it's so <UNK> awful that perhaps the fact it is one of a kind is a <UNK> in disguise
<START> this a wonderful sequel to the award winning <UNK> <UNK> miniseries in the 1980's this sequel is perhaps better than the original it is definitely more family friendly the language is more subdued there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with <UNK> jack is particularly gruesome however overall a great movie the acting is superb william peterson is fantastic such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing jon voight <UNK> fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call ricky gives a great heart filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him highly recommended
<START> superbly crafted low budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at and plenty of <UNK> humour along the way as well br br the cast play it very well although <UNK> self centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times the tiny two scene cameo by sir alec guinness <UNK> menace as the crime <UNK> of <UNK> is simply the <UNK> on the cake br br well worth repeated viewing but not on dark nights when you're all alone
<START> this is one of the best lesbian films i have ever seen this series brought joy and sadness of true love being set in the <UNK> was an amazing look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women the cast was beyond expectation <UNK> <UNK> is an amazing actress i have never seen her other works but her portrayal of <UNK> made me connect with her feeling her <UNK> and pains and love the one thing i feel most important is connecting with the characters in anything i watch if anyone has doubts on seeing this film think twice this is a must see series well done again to bbc we need more lesbian films that portrays real love and hurts like this one living in canada i had this dvd <UNK> and i am so thrilled to have purchased it
<START> the good br br carrey is good actor and he proved it in man on the moon and in eternal sunshine of the <UNK> mind but hey what can an actor do without good story and proper directing he can do number 23 br br the bad br br joel <UNK> is poor overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made what he did with batman is just disaster but probably batman movies supposed to look good well they didn't instead of gothic and macabre we got <UNK> sure falling down was great but can you ruin the film with robert duvall and michael douglas and with excellent script no you can't br br and so good actor and poor director finally met and made number 23 br br the ugly 23 br br i know that it's stupid to begin with but subplot almost half of this movie looks exactly like intro to another chapter of max <UNK> quality of detective story itself quality of the characters even colors mood and music editing and sound mix too perhaps it works for the game but surely it doesn't in the cinema br br <UNK> en scene is so bad that it becomes funny it's not even annoying carrey reads walking down the stairs in park why is it natural no but it looks good why suicide blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper if she just wanted to kill herself there is no logic in that but still it looks good guess what it it doesn't look good at all it looks unnatural instead br br all female characters are flat why is that so who cares let's go on with the story br br who is this private eye on the suicide hardly believable br br scenes when walter <UNK> is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie instead we get <UNK> routine disappointment br br interiors has no sign of people living in them except the significant objects shoes photos etc hard luck br br dialogs ain't that bad but what about v o well that's another story there's no such thing as destiny there are only different choices captain obvious to the rescue number was coming after and now it was coming after me cliché and so on br br it's obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night successfully and <UNK> br br the subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard this is so old trick and so comfortable for writer and that it should have been banned i mean it br br flashbacks and editing similar to what happened in last episode of x files isn't the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie is it br br i wish i could say that this story deserves a better fate but it doesn't it makes no sense told in <UNK> order is weak and unbelievable all the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction this could be fun but since whole movie is dead serious it isn't to many <UNK> is just bad for every story and the mystery it's predictable and easy to guess br br losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie but i never saw any of that in hollywood's productions if you're interested in the subject just watch <UNK> by polanski or something by david <UNK> spider or a history of violence both of that movies deals with similar problems that number 23 wanted to show wanted but failed
<START> people comparing this movie to big blockbusters like lord of the rings or the matrix will inevitably be disappointed with the way this movie turned out although it lacks in the big special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras there is still a masterful <UNK> of two old folk tales here the acting talent although not a list is still great and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger movie with an a list cast my particular favourite from this movie is bridget fonda whose performance as the snow queen herself was quite moving <UNK> enormously by a <UNK> wardrobe and makeup she <UNK> humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season <UNK> by the devil's evil magic fonda aside the acting was not what we have come to expect from hollywood which i think is a good thing since hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to portray roles and so they have become stale and <UNK> on cgi and other special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us instead it shows new ideas some real thinking on the part of the actors about how they can find new variations on the the old themes of love and danger
<START> being a great fan of horror especially asian horror i have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding why it does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies the actors did a good job it feels like a real documentary film even if it's not it does not get boring for a moment the director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still it's believable it reminded me of the similarly great movie forbidden <UNK> br br to me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character the psychic but this is <UNK> br br i recommend this movie to all fans of quality horror br br 9 out of 10
<START> what a show <UNK> lamas once again proves his talent as a cop who committed the worst crime a good cop can commit by being a good cop then again he shows how sensitive a cop can be displaying a range of emotions like no other actor can except maybe himself in <UNK> justice br br huge enjoyment
<START> it is a <UNK> business to film such a lavish production of the <UNK> of <UNK> it could be a <UNK> wooden period piece or it could be laughable for its <UNK> this version is neither while i am not completely sold by al very restrained <UNK> he does give a competent and honorable performance jeremy antonio is as always with his tortured self roles riveting some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of <UNK> fun a boy's own adventure story but the central plot is <UNK> and <UNK> moved forward through the film br br it goes without saying that the location shots costumes and interiors were breathtaking almost to the point of distraction br br one thing on which i do not wish to comment on is the anti content of the play the film is as sympathetic to the <UNK> of the jews as possible while still portraying <UNK> as the <UNK> of his own self destruction it is a sad comment that four centuries later the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest br br this is a beautiful film and i look forward to several viewings
<START> a bumbling error at the <UNK> of education results in boys school having to share with st school for girls this the respective head teachers of each school and leads to all manner of chaotic goings on however the two are forced to come to an uneasy alliance in the hope of major trouble br br the <UNK> days of your life is based on the john <UNK> play from 1948 with <UNK> writing the part of <UNK> specifically for margaret <UNK> replacing george <UNK> from the play in the role of <UNK> pond is <UNK> <UNK> and here in lies the <UNK> glory of this <UNK> adaptation <UNK> <UNK> are perfectly wonderful <UNK> off each other to keep what is basically a one joke movie highly entertaining directed by the gifted frank and produced by the equally <UNK> sidney the <UNK> days of your life is a <UNK> british movie obviously a <UNK> to the st <UNK> franchise the film entertains the children with it's high <UNK> clash of the <UNK> heart whilst <UNK> the watching adults with its very <UNK> <UNK> thankfully the chaotic ending <UNK> all that has gone before it to leave this particular viewer with a grin as wide as <UNK> station great fun 8 10
<START> i was a bit surprised to see all of the hate comments on here sure it's not the best kid's show but don't people stop <UNK> barney this much after the fifth grade br br okay everyone hates barney okay i think his voice and songs are annoying okay he's kinda creepy and strange i'm <UNK> years old so i know well enough but here's the thing kids they love this show br br when i was a little kiddie of two or three my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they did anything else nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes face it that's how <UNK> are even the most patient ones can't sit still long enough to give their parents a break there's too much to do and see and explore too much trouble to get into br br and then came barney i don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that's so amusing to children but they sure do love it i know i did i was hooked on the show and wanted to watch it over and over yes the songs kind of drove my parents nuts but to be able to watch their kids learning and being excited over something that can really hold their attention span it's worth it i learned my and the magic words and <UNK> your teeth i'd grown out of it by five or six of course but by that point at least i was a little more patient and gave my parents a break br br my <UNK> and nephew all went through the barney stage growing up much to their mother's delight i know what keeps barney on the air he entertains of course there's big bird ernie and oscar and they're great too but at the <UNK> stage it seems that more kids prefer the big singing dinosaur and that's enough for me
<START> i found super troopers only mildly amusing at best seemed like a <UNK> police academy ripoff to me and i rented this movie in hopes of it being better it wasn't br br the writing is absolutely horrible and the pacing of this film is even worse it doesn't feel like a whole lot happens in this film or that it really gives us a reason to give a damn about any of the characters br br the actor who plays felix is totally uninspired though possibly due in part to the dialogue he had to work with in short this movie just went wrong in so many places br br i get the impression that since films like <UNK> independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long rambling scenes of dialogue where characters are trying to be funny but where dialogue in <UNK> pushes the story forward in this movie it hopelessly <UNK> it down films are supposed to have a decent balance of action and dialogue and as <UNK> as it is for filmmakers to try to have tons of snappy funny dialogue it just doesn't always work especially if they're not that good at writing dialogue i hate to say it but even extreme heist was more interesting than this movie and that movie was so low budget it was shot on video
<START> i go to the movies to be entertained i was very entertained by the first film in this series the <UNK> code it had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested angels and demons is no different if you enjoyed the <UNK> code then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well angels and demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film but faster paced which i liked ron howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit br br what i really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously <UNK> they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable if there is one thing that i didn't like about this movie it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable don't want to give any spoilers but hey it's a movie i was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what i saw
<START> cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it but based on the many <UNK> comments actually get it i for one have always considered paul <UNK> a on the shakespeare play of the same name as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here on the other hand if you're looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play you should look elsewhere as an experiment however it succeeds just spectacularly charming moving funny sad dramatic it's all of that and much more cast locations script music are just fantastic cassavetes and <UNK> were never better susan <UNK> turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future molly <UNK> makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love <UNK> <UNK> performance he steals the show in several scenes what's more the always great cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him a study on what the <UNK> elements of shakespeare's classic might be life if updated into more modern times <UNK> burns brilliantly
<START> this movie changed the art of film making telling a complex story in a powerful new way the film mixes brutal realism with fantasy <UNK> a modern war with strange scenes full of <UNK> smoke the film uses music not as a score laid in later but as a practical part of the scene playing from <UNK> <UNK> etc coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration taking scenes and characters and putting them into entirely different surroundings that is a <UNK> and brave thing to do then he takes a superstar brando pays him a fortune and films him so that you can barely see his face the pure guts that such a move requires is astounding and it works beautifully this movie belongs in the top ten
<START> tales from the <UNK> is gory disgusting tasteless offensive <UNK> and <UNK> but that's ok i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless unfunny and boring very little of the genuine <UNK> spirit of films like class of high has remained intact in its place we get endless fart jokes to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going <UNK> thinking that adults find loud <UNK> so darn hilarious and a cynical shameless exploitation of the viewer who is essentially <UNK> time and money to see a film that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place oh yes there is plenty of female nudity on display but let's face it the average porn film probably offers a better storyline higher production values funnier humor and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity br br p s kelly powers aka <UNK> the blonde lesbian student in the how to make your own movie segment is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen
<START> i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m <UNK> mysteries could make such a mockery of them an aussie has no business in ancient rome nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script kevin connor and lee have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits
<START> if you don't like bad acting poor editing ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie if you like all of the above that is to say if you are a lynch fan then you will love <UNK> drive this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 7 0 on imdb br br outside of <UNK> <UNK> work you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in <UNK> dr the other female lead went to the hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops school of acting given the script they had to work with it's a wonder all of the actors weren't holding their heads in their hands br br characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline you have a <UNK> a mysterious cowboy an <UNK> wife and her <UNK> <UNK> lover a <UNK> type figure sitting in a <UNK> room who speaks through an <UNK> voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time br br this isn't so bad however in that it <UNK> the viewer from the fact that the movie has no <UNK> plot you will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be <UNK> disappointed the hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling <UNK> the <UNK> thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and <UNK> them up at the end for the sake of surprise guess which way lynch goes surprise br br you know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it after all a dream sequence covers all sins dreams don't have to make sense anything can happen in a dream br br the editing is similarly disjointed let's just say good editing does not call attention to itself much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing look at me you can see my editing aren't i a genius uh well no this movie has all of the <UNK> of the worst and most self indulgent french films br br so why is this movie so popular my theory is that it is just another sign of the <UNK> of our culture <UNK> are hard to <UNK> so let's listen to rap plots are hard to follow so let's <UNK> with them pictures are difficult to paint so let's pee in a cup and stick a <UNK> in it these are the <UNK> of our times and <UNK> drive is just another part of the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> has to be one of the worst directors working today in any genre and it has nothing to do with his movies usually containing and having guys run around in their matching boxer <UNK> remember anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and want to suck out your blood soul such deep symbolism here i just sat through the <UNK> to give him his fair shakes i try to watch every horror movie i can and this one had barbara from beyond re animator <UNK> in it i had previously been sucked in to the world of <UNK> thanks to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and several other actresses i like br br <UNK> tell you what about the <UNK> like the other reviewer pointed out the supposed plot involves lesbian vampires on a college campus but never has a parade of hot young babes actresses if you want running around dressed in <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> been so boring the movie has no plot no gore no nudity and the dialog is ridiculous and seems like they made it up as they go along parts are put in slow motion and repeated many times to push the running time up about ten minutes of this one consists of characters just walking around on campus oh the excitement that looks more like a hotel resort than any college i've ever been to and the acting is the absolute worst the only thing these girls do well is lean forward and bend over to show off their bodies the cast were so devoid of talent that i'd be shocked to see any of them get a one day walk on role on passions in the future <UNK> for the guys yeah <UNK> <UNK> more hot guys in underwear in this one too guys who should be in some k mart <UNK> instead of trying to act do these people actually have to audition or just show up in <UNK> office and take their clothes off i think the answer is obvious br br i am willing to give any movie a chance if 1 it's intelligently written well directed original and competently acted or hell even ambitious and stylish or 2 it is chock full of gore nudity <UNK> <UNK> and or it's unintentionally hilarious david <UNK> movies deliver none of that and they do it on better than usual production values for direct to video flicks what a waste so what is the appeal especially with the <UNK> of porn of the soft and hard core variety that's easily accessible to anyone with a computer i simply cannot answer that br br <UNK> is a gay horror director and could use his resources to put a unique spin on the genre instead he produces mind numbing drivel without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through ironically when you think about it his films are anything but pro gay they actually make homosexuality seem seedy <UNK> and sinister the obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to corrupt seduce and or kill off the innocent sexually confused leads there's no <UNK> here to make things interesting the protagonists are naive and seldom prove themselves to be strong <UNK> or confident in who they are i would understand this plotting if jerry <UNK> fred <UNK> or dr laura starting making direct to video horror films but from a gay director it just goes to show that he puts almost no thought into these <UNK> cheese <UNK>
<START> i'm a next generation person i've never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that <UNK> a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the century the new doctor who started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci fi channel or bbc america from season one we are introduce to a new player rose tyler <UNK> <UNK> and a pretty cool new doctor played by christopher <UNK> last name sorry these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world every now and then they have companions from <UNK> ex boyfriend mickey to the now ever present jack <UNK> who can now be seen on the spin off <UNK> from season one to season two the pace is just about right the stories can be from the <UNK> weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy br br in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor david <UNK> continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn't as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening companion role to martha played by the very sexy who helps continue the fight to save mankind season three now is more on the action adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons here the relationship between the doctor and martha is fitting but the <UNK> can be rushed into at times and the <UNK> comes into play that she's not rose tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don't really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat br br all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can't mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and <UNK> relationship is rushed and not <UNK> on the get to know you base i've seen good shows on british tv but this is by far one of the coolest sci fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don't have to take my world for it step into the <UNK> and join the adventure
<START> my teacher did this movie it's a new beginning watch it and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now it's something else a post revolutionary movie it is using the latest <UNK> technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you won't even know that you're watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame don't miss it pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point it's representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free
<START> this movie was terrible john wayne is a brutal actor at times the lead female playing the role of <UNK> did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite wayne's inept one dimensional over acting seriously did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep ridiculous and his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to <UNK> for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a <UNK> the story was completely implausible we were supposed to believe that two grown men both tremendous <UNK> in their respected fields would <UNK> a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another you can pretty much randomly <UNK> any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made its too bad because the only other wayne films i've seen are the <UNK> and <UNK> bravo which were both great movies unless you're being paid don't bother watching this one
<START> do not watch this movie or if you are really mad at anyone you can give this as a this is the worst movies i have ever seen do not watch this if you do remember that would be a self destructive action it is a shame that this is not voted lower
<START> the worst movie i've ever seen and i've seen <UNK> acting is horrible plot is awful idea is terrible and no research was done what's so ever ok i admit air was a pretty good movie but not soccer <UNK> this dog is smaller than my cat how can he possibly play soccer even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to <UNK> the stupid dog in half it's horrible don't watch this movie
<START> by today's standards the <UNK> might seem a little hokey lee version is more accurate i <UNK> boot camp in <UNK> island <UNK> in 1964 jim moore is as close to the real thing as you could put on the screen in 1957 i can't comment on the plot but i thought the ending was unrealistic for <UNK> <UNK> is like many who found himself in a lot more difficult situation than he <UNK> for like so many he joined the marine <UNK> for all the wrong reasons my <UNK> were more like <UNK> than jim moore a lot more the <UNK> is more korean era and full metal jacket is more <UNK> <UNK> era today's movies allow that sort of thing on the screen i have the <UNK> in my collection i only recently found it on dvd
<START> the opportunity it gave me to look at <UNK> past was <UNK> br br i had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who <UNK> from <UNK> and in watching we talked and i learned a lot from her about how things were back then br br stuff like how <UNK> and co was a <UNK> soft drinks company how rain truly could destroy a <UNK> how <UNK> used to have to collect the crop how in dance <UNK> the women and men did really have to stand along opposite walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance about the <UNK> that kept the fire going how priests really did call out the list of church and their <UNK> and a bit about the <UNK> back then which my dad helped by showing me a case displaying the <UNK> <UNK> and that were used back then which were legal tender in england also br br i didn't pay that much attention to how good the movie was but i was very grateful in having this opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is irish history but for others including some of our parents and grandparents is just their childhood
<START> what is there to say about this movie this movie is simply gorgeous a true feast for the eyes in the same way that the game set the standard for 3d role playing games 7 years ago this movie sets the standard for future cg movies many of you have seen the trailers and the amazing details in every frame and let me tell you this movie does not disappoint you can actually see the <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the music is also very good the movie contains several <UNK> tracks from the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate br br the movie's main weakness is its story its not exactly a bad story but this story is exclusively aimed for people who have played the video game first time viewers may feel lost at times or they may not notice the significance of certain events br br i recommend this movie to everyone even if you've never played the game because what we have here is a special movie watch it and enjoy the the beautiful show
<START> well they sent it on tv between midnight and 2 00 am it seems like the right time to watch it and then go to bed afterwards br br no it was not really living up to my expectations i think the dogma concept is good because the film then gets closer to what's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood making music out but then again this concept requires some interesting action between the characters br br i cannot say that i know king <UNK> the shakespeare version very well if i had known the play i would probably have been able to predict much of the film br br well a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display and we certainly see some bad sides oh yes the paint of <UNK> and culture can be very thin and behind this paint you may find an animal br br if you then compare it with for italian for <UNK> or sang last song you see the same but opposite thing a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more <UNK> way and if you dare do you may win br br when the film had ended i thought to myself oh that's why i haven't seen it before the film has its own beauty the quality of the work of the cameraman actors etc is good but the script could need something more a plot maybe wouldn't hurt
<START> one night at wants you to think it is a hip and clever black comedy it pushes its quirky characters and outrageous situations at the viewer like a crack dealer making <UNK> the premise is about a gold digging woman named jewel who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder so she can have all the <UNK> she so desperately desires you know this wouldn't be a bad <UNK> if she chased after rich guys this film really wants one to believe that a <UNK> con artist would waste time dating <UNK> and andrew <UNK> clay please that major flaw in <UNK> scheme is really the only entertainment to found found in this stinker and that's unintentional watching it it is not hard to believe there could have been a good movie inside it somewhere one night at just could not decide what direction it wanted to take so just sat in the middle of the road like a dead it tries to be sexy but no clothes are removed on camera and the few scenes of body head are dreadfully pedestrian there is one recurring scene where a <UNK> is asking the played by matt dillon about how the sex is with jewel it seems like matt doesn't know neither do the viewers why was he dating her anyway one night at also wants to be funny sorry bizarre <UNK> and <UNK> didn't even work on <UNK> company what's worse is that this movie really seemed like it was going for a dark atmosphere to <UNK> its comedy kind of like a <UNK> <UNK> brothers film but its shallow script could not play subtlety nor could its lackluster <UNK> in any shocks what the audience is left with is a film that seems to busy trying to please everybody and just losing any appeal along the way
<START> this movie is terrible a true hockey fan would have to assume that the people that appeared in and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game i got this hoping that it would be a guy movie but the only people that would probably enjoy this movie are females between the ages of 13 17 the hockey scenes are terrible playing like they're 5 years old diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc it's so difficult to predict the end of this movie though for those who have seen it who would have guessed for those that haven't seen it don't waste your time br br i figured it out less than halfway through the movie to call this movie a drama is ridiculous
<START> and normally i don't like surprises watch this movie by chance in a motel in south africa second week of a three month holiday in <UNK> apart from being well shot and acted it helped me in understanding the countries problems tremendously just watched the million dollar baby and had to look up <UNK> <UNK> since the name sounded somewhat familiar and her acting was superb didn't realise she was the <UNK> in the red dust well now i'm not to worried that she will disappear as so many other <UNK> of clint before now i am being asked to write ten whole lines of comment which is rather ridiculous for i have written what i wanted to write ok here it goes i think if you are from a western country especially europe watching will help you to understand a little better why what is happening is happening down there so this hopefully will fill ten lines
<START> i really tried to like saw the story was good and i admire the <UNK> pace of the way the film was shot however there were too many clichés and elements that while they may have looked cool they really made no sense br br first what i liked about the film was the overall tone of the story and i thought the premise was fantastic the character of the jigsaw killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage <UNK> <UNK> danny glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective and monica potter was good in a <UNK> role as a doctor's <UNK> wife smith's scene was incredible and both wan and should be <UNK> for using that scene as a <UNK> to get the backing for the film the whole notion that the jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill themselves is an excellent notion but once the film got going logic began to get away br br once they showed that <UNK> was the one holding dr <UNK> wife and daughter hostage it was apparent that he was not the jigsaw killer and part of it the scene where he puts a <UNK> over the heart of the terrified diana while allison screams at him through her gag was one of the most gratuitous scenes i've ever seen it was supposed to be chilling but establishing nothing also since the jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves he has no problem <UNK> the throat of a police officer i guess it's a way to show that he doesn't want to get caught and will go to any means necessary to ensure that doesn't happen but to me it just didn't make any logic especially when he shows no <UNK> over the death of another detective which i did like that setup just would've been better if given to someone who actually deserved it br br i felt leigh was fine as adam it wasn't really a <UNK> role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor however i wasn't too fond of james <UNK> direction the story may have been original but the direction sure wasn't i guess i'm tired of quick mtv style cuts in favor of the old approach to directing but a lot of scenes involving the jigsaw killer reminded me too much of <UNK> way too much of it as the film progressed to me it was starting to become a series of <UNK> <UNK> like hey look what i can do instead of being intriguing it became very distracting but hey it worked he's now directing final destination 3 so he's on a path to a successful career and i think he will become a top notch horror director in years to come br br what really did it in for me was the ending like i said i knew that jigsaw wasn't <UNK> and i liked how adam discovered the mini tape player after killing him it would've had a terrific ending except for one fatal flaw i felt they should've left it where you didn't know who the killer was the way it was done was only done for one reason boy are we clever uh no to me it just didn't make sense br br some of the better horror films are made for a reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story while saw started out very well it started to become <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> need to be cool and detract from the winning story they had perhaps if they weren't too <UNK> on making the films themselves and relied on a more experienced horror director to <UNK> it i think it would've been the horror classic that it <UNK> has been given over the past four months if this and cabin fever are the future of horror i'm very scared
<START> there is no way to put into words just how bad how <UNK> and <UNK> these vice academy films really are you have to experience one for yourself for the third time in a row writer director rick sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent there is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at yet the very brief nudity and other plot elements make the films <UNK> for kids which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental <UNK> of 5 year olds elizabeth makes a more than welcome replacement for <UNK> <UNK> she is <UNK> <UNK> and cute and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well but watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse <UNK>
<START> i loved this movie so much i'm a big fan of amanda recently ended show i admire her besides her body for her acting <UNK> she is a good actress br br the movie was great its about a girl named <UNK> who wants to play soccer but when her school cuts the girls soccer team she gets upset her brother is set to go to a <UNK> school and he decides to leave to england so <UNK> wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the <UNK> school she goes to the school and tries out for the soccer team she gets in meanwhile she meets duke who is a sensitive guy who plays on the soccer team he really likes olivia laura <UNK> who likes sebastian who is really <UNK> sebastian is dating <UNK> and suspects that sebastian isn't being himself br br this is certainly not a chick flick and i enjoyed it a lot its so funny and lovable i don't think i have seen amanda act better
<START> when i stepped into the theater i thought this was going to be a great movie and i was not disappointed one bit wow this movie is brilliant the emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary great acting by and beautiful music by a r <UNK> this might most probably be the best <UNK> movie i've seen in ages <UNK> has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies br br this movie is basically about a young girl p s who is in search of her <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> who abandoned her in a <UNK> camp to fight for her country just like her husband j d a young novelist finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her he and his wife decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her <UNK> mother br br this movie really screams excellent the way <UNK> presented the movie is magnificent br br my rating 10 10
<START> my wife and i watched this marvelous movie this evening because we will watch russian dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second br br we both loved the apartment and will enjoy following some of the characters through the early years of their lives now in st russia we both identified slightly with the rough <UNK> of the story because we were students <UNK> italy for us so the script was not completely foreign to our early lives our living was considerably different but as with this movie anytime you throw together young people passing through the same life <UNK> as any developed world people they will experience much the same life situations br br the collection of people and the personal difficulties that they faced were and <UNK> lies the beauty of this film and probably its sequence that i will see tomorrow as i wrote the characters as well as these situations are familiar to all of us and therefore we can enjoy living their lives for awhile this must be one of the film's great strengths allowing the viewer to <UNK> experience the emotional <UNK> of the people involved and yet remain <UNK> the viewer can through that distance chuckle to themselves thinking i wouldn't have done something that dumb or i would have avoided that trap maybe that's why we go to movies
<START> this was one of the worst films i have ever seen i'm still trying to get over how bad it was just because it has <UNK> name attached to it doesn't make it great beyond the fact it makes absolutely no sense we see one insanely long shot of a traffic jam that is not stunning unbelievable or anything of the sort while this long shot of the traffic jam is going on you will be feeling probably more like making a <UNK> than continuing watching it pieces of a supposed story silly stupid characters what message are we suppose to take from this it offers nothing and serves no purpose the arrogance of the director in <UNK> these <UNK> dull chain smoking french people and having them sit around and <UNK> for hours on end and then getting it passed off as art is truly astounding
<START> how do stories this bad get made that's not a question it is a statement br br here are my problems with the film br br 1 much of the story development was predictable and boring my emotions ran pretty much in a flat line throughout there wasn't really much to draw the viewer into the film br br 2 the characters were decidedly <UNK> one was a <UNK> another was confusing and the third was pretty damned boring there was absolutely zero reason to be drawn to these people even though i knew it wouldn't happen i kept hoping that they would run into someone else someone more interesting br br 3 the physical environment was uncomfortable for me a trailer in the desert the desert is a place that most people would prefer not to visit how is it that these three people end up in the desert br br 4 and in the same desert did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on earth would manage to find each other within the span of a few weeks out in that desert br br 5 was it really necessary for ms ryan to be in two scenes that required a <UNK> hey she looks great but it was pretty gratuitous br br okay so if i thought it was so bad why did i give it a 3 i am trying to be as objective as possible even though i found alan annoying i have to say that david did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd the character reminded me of a few of albert brooks more annoying roles <UNK> ryan tried to do something with sarah but it just wasn't written very well okay so she was supposed to be a confused dysfunctional woman but why what did it add to the story her mood <UNK> left me feeling like i was being <UNK> hard one way and then another and then another br br i don't often walk out on films but this one had me <UNK> it several times stiff predictable boring proceed at your own risk br br my 2 cents
<START> this film isn't a little bad it's not even kind of bad it's horrid you know you're in trouble when <UNK> shows up in a film she must have had the week off from love boat george kennedy at least he's a <UNK> he's in there trying actually he's all right and it's good to see martha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> okay there's slightly better acting than in airport <UNK> but what film doesn't have better acting than airport <UNK> one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot wise at least they made an attempt at subplots what really hurts this film is the special effects ugh not too special if you ask me this is the kind of film that at <UNK> is truly truly funny if you've been up having fun with your buddies and you're looking for something to laugh at
<START> errol flynn had quite a gift for comedy that was sadly rarely exploited given the right material this film demonstrates that he could have happily been quite at home in cary grant style gentle comedies out of his various <UNK> into the genre this is certainly the best <UNK> brady gives a fine performance in the child part and <UNK> parker looks simply stunning throughout the film an added bonus is the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> who is sadly underused in this film a welcome presence none the less flynn carries off his comedic duties with the same easy style that he brought to his <UNK> roles the fact that he makes it look like it's easy doesn't mean that it is a super little family comedy great for the christmas period or any other time you feel like being <UNK> up
<START> scratch is a documentary about <UNK> and their art of scratching from that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is it is a <UNK> and vibrant celebration of a cool <UNK> which is little known it's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top <UNK> e g dj q bert dj shadow and mix master mike from the <UNK> boys showing off their stuff going into the film i wasn't sure that scratching can really be called an art form or that the <UNK> can be viewed as an <UNK> in its own right scratch completely changed my mind on these points what these guys do with their is truly amazing it is definitely some kind of art and the <UNK> if you know how to use it can be transformed into an <UNK> that you can play as much as a drum or a guitar and you even get a lesson on the <UNK> of scratching from dj q bert e g how to use the to get different sound effects all these <UNK> in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching <UNK> <UNK> perform his song rock it you remember that song don't you live at the what got their attention was not <UNK> himself but his dj and his scratching not only is scratch about scratching but it does some scratching of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited there are moments where clips are quickly <UNK> and then <UNK> several times which mirrors in the film medium what happens when a dj quickly moves the record on his <UNK> back and forth while using his that sound whether you're a fan of hip hop or not you can count on scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies after seeing it i had an <UNK> to go buy a <UNK> of my own and i mean this as a compliment
<START> what ho this one is jolly good i say jolly good ol' <UNK> or should i say ol' bean my <UNK> of british <UNK> is a little dusty anyway my biker boots and i walked into this screening with no prior viewing experience of wallace and <UNK> i'm happy to say that my boots and i walked out pleased to have made their <UNK> br br while not as adult accessible as toy story w g still manages to be clever enough to provide the grown ups with a little humor that will most definitely <UNK> over the heads of the young <UNK> who are too busy <UNK> at the were to have any clue that something is <UNK> i highly suggest that you pay close attention any time you see books or words on the screen because there are quick glimpses of <UNK> that you'll miss if you aren't paying attention my favorite is a book of monsters that refers to the <UNK> <UNK> monster as tourist if you've ever been known to say i can really relate to kevin <UNK> or if you're just illiterate then not only will you miss out on these jokes but you probably should be spending your time learning to read instead of going to movies consider this a public service <UNK> br br the most impressive aspect about w g is its clay animation thanks to the tedious process it took five years to finish the film according to the press notes there were some days when the <UNK> goal was to merely accomplish 10 seconds of completed film folks i sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to finish <UNK> to a handful of <UNK> or adding <UNK> to pictures for my reviews a point that is proved by a lack of pictures in this review so i can't even imagine having the required patience for that br br i really like the rough hands on quality of the <UNK> figures the fact that you can see <UNK> in the clay is a nice personal touch how can you not be impressed with clay characters that show more expression and emotion than paul walker and keanu reeves combined the curse of the were rabbit is as director nick park calls it the world's first <UNK> horror movie that should entertain both kids and adults alike relying on and as a male who <UNK> himself in his shaggy haired cool <UNK> <UNK> i hesitate to use this word cute and oh man i probably shouldn't use this word either lovable characters rather than outdated m c hammer references w g is proof that <UNK> can create entertaining animation when it chooses <UNK> over the cheap joke
<START> black rain is a superb film but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as 300 <UNK> i have the dvd and it's terrible very tiny non <UNK> image that has to be blown up to resolution killing size acceptable sound this is a primitive dvd that absolutely has to be <UNK> br br btw i also own the <UNK> and the vhs of black rain the vhs is a huge step <UNK> from the dvd and the <UNK> has far and away the best picture of them in the black sharp big picture simple but very good soundtrack buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous <UNK> these <UNK> artists are demanding
<START> i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones we'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks <UNK> the lines to each other br br we called one of our mates after the brilliant episode in which daniel <UNK> has a bit of on his nose by the back street <UNK> br br lots of great lines remember at 5 30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man take it easy guy gandhi as a local <UNK> br br tony was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph daniel <UNK> to be a <UNK> it's no good amanda i'll never make it as a bar man helen <UNK> teaches him to ask people about the match see the match last night i thought played well after a string of failed conversations the curly haired <UNK> star was sitting at the bar see the match last night yeah i thought i played well br br we still do odd stupid lines now <UNK> and ralph or ralph and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the the back street <UNK> a personal favourite with the great ending line and he'll mark your <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> br br good old danny <UNK> you added a lot to some young <UNK> sir br br update i found a couple of episodes on tape i'm going to the gandhi sketch to youtube
<START> this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it <UNK> to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong br br this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it <UNK> to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong
<START> the definition of a vampire is an <UNK> corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of <UNK> <UNK> and neck biting being an r rated movie i knew this was actually going to <UNK> to vampires actually being vampires which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to twilight having viewed chan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i had very high expectations of br br i anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti hero known as priest sang and was very impressed by his performance as a holy man who is forced into this <UNK> of being <UNK> and <UNK> his <UNK> as a vampire spoiler after the initial premise of him surviving the <UNK> blood <UNK> he starts to <UNK> blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability the screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition he starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be <UNK> for moral reasons the <UNK> tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative <UNK> is very riveting as they are played by the <UNK> ho song and actress ok <UNK> kim the special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and cgi it didn't <UNK> itself into the plot driven and character developed premise the story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own korean style br br there aren't many <UNK> i can say about sometimes i ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long the movie was long to begin with on the same token vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with as mentioned before this movie is very tragic so don't expect anything hopeful while watching this br br overall is delightfully dark morbid and original i strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of twilight this is definitely the korean answer to the swedish let the right one in which is also a good movie
<START> when one thinks of soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of <UNK> or the somber <UNK> of <UNK> generally come to mind they're great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there however the countries within the iron curtain apparently enjoyed their <UNK> musicals just as much as the states had in fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these song and dance <UNK> were released to much <UNK> by the public however they are completely <UNK> of in the west so this documentary attempts to <UNK> that situation it does a terrific job of both <UNK> these films and putting them into the proper cultural context despite the fact i've never been a fan of musicals i found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end it goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime you're only <UNK> the surface of whats out there br br as for the film clips themselves they're very entertaining while some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films particularly the later ones look quite accomplished from a production standpoint plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes there's a few similarities between them and the american musicals i'm used to but the presence of strict government <UNK> of a message gives them a surreal edge they certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the west this documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films i've seen in recent memory and its an absolute must see for any film buff 9 10
<START> an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can't quite grasp <UNK> lots of bats some terrorists and a team that acts like the gang that can't shoot straight all thrown together in a <UNK> plot with mediocre acting this one has nothing much going for it the characters are not compelling even the setting which has great possibilities looks like something out of the middle of rural <UNK> not an exotic forest in eastern europe br br the bats are certainly <UNK> looking they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet <UNK> or chop off an arm you see <UNK> force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault <UNK> and <UNK> at them and bat <UNK> to the ground it would be like trying to shoot <UNK> with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet utterly clueless the dialogue is unrealistic with boy girl jokes and <UNK> in the middle of tense parts of the mission one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body stunned not even bothering to take cover or secure the area in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a <UNK> thanks for the heads up <UNK> br br if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out <UNK> <UNK> is not the movie you want to see in fact i think i'm going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half seems unlikely at this point
<START> at first i didn't think i would like this movie but as it progressed it became better and better i love music and i was impressed with how well cage could fake the movements of playing a <UNK> my son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story <UNK> slowly showing how won the girls heart the acting and the story were both well done and well directed at first <UNK> was irritating but soon he grew on you the twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the germans i would like to see this again to follow all the side plots i also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again
<START> a couple are split apart during a vacation early scenes lead us to believe barney jeff <UNK> character has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but <UNK> <UNK> the film plays out some years later where despite a new love interest jeff <UNK> sutherland is determined to solve her disappearance br br the storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work br br ok here we go the <UNK> scene aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where sandra <UNK> and <UNK> sutherland are made to perform a little signed pet love ritual that's drowned in over sentimentality to the point of <UNK> we know they're in love the i do <UNK> swear never to leave you speech only moments prior was ample thank you jeff <UNK> robot accent is another example what is that for <UNK> is back and it seems after a decade on the planet he's turned nasty the entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who by a rather fortunate twist of fate has quite <UNK> powers of observation the climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much much better it's <UNK> with further <UNK> and another <UNK> continuity <UNK> i could go on but something positive needs to be said at a stretch <UNK> sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance br br the 1988 original of the same name changed from the dutch title <UNK> for english speaking audiences was recommended to me only for an online rental company to send me this later hollywood version by mistake i was surprised to find both having been directed by george <UNK> and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake i am <UNK> and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot for that but it really doesn't take much doing
<START> there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced forced acting forced takes forced plot even forced photography there's people who say the movie develops that way because it's from asia but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or <UNK> there's a thin line between being fiction and every work of art it is in it's way fiction and being just unlikely in a more personal way i just don't feel anything with the movie it doesn't take me anywhere and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is <UNK> it just doesn't feel right there's something in it or through that just doesn't click
<START> i watched sea of dust at the <UNK> island horror film festival in <UNK> it was the <UNK> featured film and won best picture out of i think a couple hundred entries the director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing one star <UNK> <UNK> was even <UNK> in person than in the film and she was an eye <UNK> in the movie br br this film is independent yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel it even has an original classical style musical score br br i am a <UNK> fan and he's the star villain here in black cape he's more of an evil force than a real person i think he is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of god on earth in his view christ was all about suffering and <UNK> <UNK> to make everyone suffer br br the main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor <UNK> who is sent to investigate the strange events <UNK> is causing in an isolated town he <UNK> to an aristocrat chick on the way but her <UNK> father tells him to get lost then he meets up with a strangely possessed but <UNK> country girl i think she falls in love with him but she also tries to kill him as do a number of hot women in the film br br i found the scenes shot in the woods to be the <UNK> and most eye catching with strange people along the road the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me br br the film has a lot to it too much to list there is a lot of blood torture and gore hot chicks <UNK> blood off of <UNK> fingers a terrified girl's head explodes that was unexpected throats get <UNK> some brutal <UNK> br br then they play it for laughs sometimes <UNK> a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre br br if you're a fan of hammer films and ingrid pitt it is fascinating to see her in this movie she offs one of the leads by <UNK> a cross in his skull excellent the guy who played multiple in silence of the <UNK> is great in an axe fight br br the movie is surreal and with the ending i'm not sure the events happened or if they were in <UNK> head because of his <UNK> by his would be fiancée he returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal br br the director also talked about the theme of religion being <UNK> to back wars and killings i can see that for sure <UNK> view of religion was scary br br this was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like <UNK> and pitt a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes great gore scenes action and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next br br this deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort i don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget and yet they managed to make something really attractive unique and thought provoking
<START> this is one of the most ridiculous westerns that hollywood ever made gary cooper plays a former <UNK> officer wanted by the law he meets up with a moron named played by <UNK> <UNK> who is a u s <UNK> with no knowledge of <UNK> is on his way to dallas to see his <UNK> played by ruth roman <UNK> father has plenty of men but they can't seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle which are regularly by the <UNK> brothers will <UNK> played by raymond massey has <UNK> the <UNK> on the estate making things completely absurd he even has the power to call for <UNK> <UNK> before they're due simply because he feels like it br br since is a boston boy who can't fight since he only became a <UNK> so he could visit his <UNK> just another instance of more plot nonsense are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job wait a minute this guy couldn't pass the written test either he switches identities with <UNK> <UNK> who of course is an expert <UNK> <UNK> takes the liberty of <UNK> girl with a passionate kiss while looks on like an idiot gary cooper hollywood's number one stud is in fine form here as <UNK> before the movie's done not only does he take job he steals his <UNK> also and ruth roman as falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the brush off before the films little more than half over br br there isn't a shred of plot credibility in the whole film so despite the good cast and lush photography the film is a dud and <UNK> character is a complete <UNK> to boot the film also stars barbara <UNK> as <UNK> girl a beautiful and talented actress who <UNK> away her chances unfortunately by making too many <UNK> for the wrong reasons i strongly suggest you pass this one up
<START> to say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all after all this show is made by the same crew responsible for airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies writing is superb even though the show is built on one liners they don't become overbearing or annoying leslie <UNK> is <UNK> his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying you ain't seen nothing yet the format was definitely polished to introduce naked gun when watching these movies notice how many are taken from the tv show the brilliant part is that they don't have to be changed too much the show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later
<START> i'm surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here specially because they're indeed interesting questions surely the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves nevertheless i think i can shed some light upon something that i think has been overlooked which is in my opinion the purpose of the film what it is about and what it's trying to convey what's its message after all at the risk of pointing out the very obvious i'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention they're trying to tell a story <UNK> meaning out of it and get a point across with this in mind we can shoot down many of the criticized points particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show causes and consequences of violence the film is not about that it's not <UNK> non brazilian audiences about the brazilian issue well who wanted to do that is this or that and supported by whom it doesn't matter in this context not enough women in the film for your tastes it's not about <UNK> or the feminist cause every little detail about <UNK> life mother son family and all the aspects and the <UNK> of the movement well don't be so <UNK> because it doesn't matter there's just so much length a story can have before it can't become a film anymore if the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting they'd have to make a 6 months tv series instead if you are expecting all that you approach the film the wrong way br br the film is actually about two individuals who started a movement two individuals full of ideals two individuals who <UNK> for change two individuals trying to do something about all the <UNK> going around them individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again it's all about finding purpose in life drawing inspiration from misery changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be criminals and drug dealers for that matter it's about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in <UNK> de <UNK> though it's an integral part of the film given that's what the characters are constantly surrounded by unexpectedly and not without a reason the film ends up centered much more on <UNK> course through difficulties in life this is because they were faced with <UNK> accident while they were shooting the film i'm not sure about this but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there leaving behind all effort spent but anderson wanted to keep going and so they did <UNK> to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis considering the sudden change of course but gaining in showing someone <UNK> such a devastating happening it's very evident for who watches it that the film begins about and winds up about anderson it's very unique in this sense the shift of the story line maybe their only sin is not making it evident <UNK> which may initially rise expectations that will go <UNK> br br as for the importance or <UNK> of anderson i'd say not everybody wants to change the whole world end all violence feed all the hungry be like <UNK> <UNK> be as known as mother <UNK> or whoever other known personalities there are it's much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is such as everybody else in fact trying to <UNK> his or her own harsh life raising <UNK> kids <UNK> with permanent <UNK> or <UNK> and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month to understand the movie you have to see that's about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime making up for it and trying to <UNK> others not to go down the same <UNK> path though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method you cannot deny their intentions br br also the perception that anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting as much as becoming friends with them there's no way it wouldn't <UNK> the whole movie with a more <UNK> light over anderson if a dear friend becomes <UNK> in an accident it's not just a fact you make a big deal out of it and this is not necessarily bad it's not much that they treat him like a chosen one as much as they go to great <UNK> trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration br br in conclusion don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains watch it for what it is much more an inspirational story br br <UNK> ad like seems just damn good and <UNK> made to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the film <UNK> <UNK> on its <UNK> as a documentary if you will but why not when it's supposed to cause reaction and inspire isn't trying to better people's lives through music and dance the essence of what the subjects are trying to do <UNK> the very own reality <UNK> me but showing just the plain facts is what <UNK> do and you can watch it on tv every night br br if i wanted to become a filmmaker i wish my first film would also be this great
<START> it was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious it was a poor man's not to mention high school less than zero i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add so many issues are left <UNK> and that's okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible the voice over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch don't waste your time on this
<START> this is a beautifully filmed movie that questions the future of all <UNK> peoples especially <UNK> <UNK> focusing on the of <UNK> the film moves at pace that may make some western viewers uncomfortable for some peoples life still proceeds at the same pace which it has for thousands of years this film follows a group of <UNK> on their <UNK> two month quest to get salt their tribe lives its life in a traditional manner slowly by modern standards and always <UNK> to their many gods this is a remarkable film one which will <UNK> a piece of what may unfortunately become history well worth the time don't be in a rush when you see it
<START> i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had <UNK> it's a stinker of epic proportions what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of <UNK> discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had the comedy is extremely weak i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny you might find a laugh or two the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art and there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together it seems to drag on and on and on br br well you may be asking yourself if it's as bad as you say why haven't you rated it lower than a 3 10 good question and i've got two answers first the movie is not without its curiosity value i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b c with <UNK> welch i'll give when women had <UNK> a point for its historic value the other two points are for the mere presence of <UNK> i know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do it's the best i can come up with
<START> this movie had lots of potential beautiful women cute guys a beach beer a hot <UNK> a mansion on the beach a swimming pool a sexy maid who hates her job and really nice cars however the movie had one thing that doomed it to failure a full length script and a bunch of sexy women who want to give acting a try because they think it would be a cool idea br br let's put it this way br br if you find yourself at a party and you have a choice between watching this movie or a <UNK> <UNK> training video from the 70s choose the <UNK> training video
<START> i'm proud to say i'm a student at <UNK> where parts of the film were shot yep i recognize mitchell hall where i took a film class possibly the same course as fellow student smith br br that's where i learned about american movie our professor told us about it shortly before its release to be sure i was intrigued but for some reason i put off seeing it for several months it must've done pretty well if it was still playing at least in <UNK> br br when i finally got around to seeing it i thought it was an entertaining documentary it's not a masterpiece it goes on a bit too long but i find <UNK> passion and commitment inspiring i hope this film <UNK> the <UNK> of bigger and better things him maybe his <UNK> <UNK> will <UNK> him to fortune who knows br br rating out of br br <UNK> min released by <UNK> pictures classics
<START> this bittersweet slice of magic realism had a <UNK> production history director writer replaced and <UNK> at the box office but it's a <UNK> film br br <UNK> wood and joseph are pre teen brothers whose <UNK> mom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up with a mean spirited alcoholic adam baldwin during his drinking <UNK> baldwin physically <UNK> and <UNK> him into remaining silent about his situation but when wood on to what's happening the boys put their heads together and <UNK> a solution to devastating dilemma br br i love films that mix fantasy and dark reality they are rarely successful <UNK> lawn dogs is a similar example but they are usually original and intriguing br br the drunk baldwin is shot from a low child's perspective and his head is deliberately <UNK> off below the top of frame this device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally beast both wood and are excellent and they pull us effortlessly into their dark frightening world br br the radio <UNK> of the title is a small red <UNK> kids transport their <UNK> in here it <UNK> a dream br br seriously interesting stuff
<START> death camp opera right here right now br br ten years ago i read that a very special movie had been directed about the <UNK> of our society a certain peter was the author his picture was acted by some non professional actors citizens like you and <UNK> and others the violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic was it a movie a documentary both actually br br over the years i realized how hard it was to find it maybe i would by coincidence anyway it's yet an old story i saw it a short while ago totally <UNK> my very favourite peace of art punishment park is its name i love this <UNK> fiction this this what ever after all the shock movies i saw i reach the best with this strong and intense i found a masterpiece there is enough on the net to know many things about the movie it is even to buy on dvd with additional stuff the only words i want to add is about my own experience with this film i can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch a cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art or the opposite br br so i'm not talking about all the we can see on tv especially the <UNK> whom the concepts of people playing them <UNK> are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way in punishment park we can see some real individuals living as they are we only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be it's a kind of therapy a way of for those inside the movie and also for the active <UNK> in front of screens then to end the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a <UNK> camp <UNK> where some folks are on the run after <UNK> trials punishment park is for those who want to grow see this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality grow up and yourself with it if you can feel it if you can see it in my case punishment park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will
<START> this is one particular <UNK> short that actually uses satire in <UNK> with slapstick a <UNK> as mentioned the title and concept for this short was borrowed from a feature film from the same year with clark gable called men in white it's basically about the trials and <UNK> of <UNK> and their sacred cause for duty and humanity i saw this recently and almost treated it like the <UNK> version because it does take itself a little too seriously in any case men in black is so well written directed and not to mention original it didn't borrow a thing from chaplin or any of the others that the motion picture academy nominated it for an award as the best short comedy of 1934 some <UNK> short called la <UNK> <UNK> it though and stole the award some <UNK> brother in law must have been on the <UNK> voting board men in black <UNK> fun at the whole concept of the medical profession much in the same way that the marx bros always did at this time may not be a fair comparison but i can see the marx bros in this short in fact in their feature a day at the races there is a scene where there's medical things going on and they cause <UNK> as usual my guess that this particular short was judged along those lines and hence why it was nominated in the first place try this in fact watch this short first and then watch duck soup or day at the races with the and then see if there isn't the same great quality of comedy
<START> this movie was really well written and was very entertaining there was great acting in it too luke perry did a very convincing job like he always does if you are looking for a <UNK> movie to watch this should be at the top of your list there is a mixture of comedy drama and action you can literally feel what the actors are feeling at points i was very impressed by this movie the special effects were very well done the whole movie was very convincing this movie is one of my favorites what happens is north america could be torn apart and jack and his team have to try and to stop an <UNK> by destroying north america it was a very cool and creative idea i loved this movie and i know you will too
<START> a heroic young trail <UNK> leads a large party of <UNK> along the big trail to the west with indian attacks natural disasters romantic complications all part of the adventure br br as sweeping magnificent as its story <UNK> <UNK> the big trail is a wonderful film as entertaining as it was more than seven decades ago with very good acting and excellent production values it lives up to its reputation as the first epic western br br john wayne pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role looks <UNK> young but he immediately <UNK> with the natural charm <UNK> authority he brings to the hero's role he quietly <UNK> the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> as a lovely southern belle who slowly <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comic el is great fun as a swedish immigrant <UNK> with <UNK> mother in law <UNK> his appearance in a scene <UNK> laughs for the viewer br br looking sounding like a human <UNK> bear <UNK> power sr vast repulsive makes a wonderful villain slick ian keith is a sophisticated bad guy his famous physical similarity to john gilbert is very apparent here silent movie character actor <UNK> marshall is impressive as a <UNK> old mountain man who helps guide the <UNK> train <UNK> russ powell as a friendly fur <UNK> puts his vocal talent for making nonsense noises to good use sharp eyed movie <UNK> will spot ward bond as one of the <UNK> <UNK> br br what will surprise many modern viewers is that the big trail was filmed in an early wide screen process called <UNK> more than living up to its name the picture looks marvelous with walsh showing a <UNK> of the new technology he fills the screen every portion of it with action notice during the crowd scenes how everyone is busy doing real work which adds so much to the <UNK> of these sequences walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use wide screen in addition the film is <UNK> free of the rear projection photography which so many older films it should also be <UNK> that it is only natural that the soundtrack sounds a little primitive <UNK> were still in their cradle that walsh was able to use a <UNK> at all with most of the scenes shot out of doors is more kudos for him br br the big trail was not a box office success in 1930 william <UNK> comedies were the big money makers and the public was looking for fare other than intelligent westerns most of the cast slipped into obscurity including wayne it would not be until 1939 when john ford rescued him in <UNK> that john wayne's legend would begin in earnest and despite its grand sweeping <UNK> it would be another 25 years before wide screen caught on with hollywood largely as an answer to the economic threat from television
<START> i had the pleasure of seeing live before seeing the video version of the show while nothing can compare to actually being there the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor the feel the sensation and so much more the wonderful performances of stunningly amazing <UNK> are beautifully captured throughout the video flows as smoothly and <UNK> as the production itself a wonderful experience
<START> after searching for 6 months i finally found this dvd all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait rush in <UNK> may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence i'm not joking it's incredible all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable i find it makes you feel like you're actually in <UNK> watching the concert from the audience that's one of the reasons i love this dvd it makes you feel like you're actually there also <UNK> alex and neil have never been in better form <UNK> are flawless <UNK> guitar playing is still incredible and neil absolutely no words to say the camera work on this concert was very good i must say they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on stage and in the audience kudos to the <UNK> anyways enough of my raving go watch rush in <UNK> for yourself you will be amazed i guarantee it br br 10 10
<START> warm hearted <UNK> depicting arch angel michael as a <UNK> overweight cigarette smoking <UNK> who loves to dance and <UNK> with the opposite sex he does have a good side however as he <UNK> to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being <UNK> to heaven funny well played out film very enjoyable although somewhat <UNK>
<START> i watched this film when i was a kid and i thought it was terrible then now that i'm older i found it just as terrible universal could have done better than this they merely decided to make the most money they could out of using all their monsters at once to me that was a cheap shot these characters were capable of holding their own in their own movies and the choice of actors was <UNK> dracula needed to be bela lugosi <UNK> monster needed to be karloff br br in my mind it was the disney <UNK> sequel sequence done decades ago and it was not appreciated started out with something great and original and then thought they could <UNK> to the masses with the schlock which is extremely evident in this film
<START> this film is a fine example of why the shaw brothers are among the finest directors probably the best in the kung fu category the movie is well paced the story is excellent and intriguing and while the humor may not be in your face it is <UNK> within the character interactions once the story builds up and the characters begin to <UNK> the situation does the whole tower come crashing down in one of the best fight scenes tiger <UNK> and <UNK> hung <UNK> are very present there is even a scene that <UNK> 18th century western social events and ends with clever and entertaining fighting the movie ends with a sudden cheesy moment but if you are a fan of the shaw brothers you'll understand that the cheese is just a <UNK> and not the main course of the movie
<START> i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up what possessed the filmmakers to do this this is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else to fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her <UNK> her aid to and of course her ten cats do not see this film and have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it they do not have a clue there are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share but <UNK> is not one of them the people i took to this movie say they have forgiven me but that they will never ever stop kidding me about it
<START> obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre but i think this one is done quite well br br it's cute clever dark this story brought back memories of the types of girls i was in love with as a child br br also it makes me want to check out some of other movies many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video br br sure there is some burton influence here but i wouldn't say this brad is trying to rip him off br br he is just jumping in adding his talents to a genre that i can appreciate i like what he does he does it well <UNK> said
<START> this movie is worse than <UNK> gate or plan 9 from outer space don't know why it got even one oscar it should have gotten a million <UNK> just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place the hospital was a first rate financial failure but i'm certain the elite classes of left wing <UNK> mouthed <UNK> that the american public was far too to appreciate biting social commentary when they saw it and on and on george c scott in one of most <UNK> and embarrassing roles along with aging sex symbol diana <UNK> spend most of the movie trying to <UNK> in an increasingly <UNK> manner as they push along a silly plot poor old george is <UNK> and is just crushed by the event but after lots of dirty language between him and <UNK> he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy <UNK> nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it there's also some <UNK> junk dialog tossed about <UNK> and <UNK> laced with plenty of <UNK> as well it ends by portraying the <UNK> notion that unusual stress without physical <UNK> always brings on <UNK> arrest never want to see another minute of this awful movie again
<START> a vampire prince falls for a human girl unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter that's the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from underworld and buffy the vampire <UNK> but manages to maintain a style of its own i was <UNK> by the uk and hong kong title the twins effect as there are no twins involved in the story it turns out that the two main female characters are played by hong kong pop stars who perform as the twins don't let this put you off these girls can act at least well enough for this type of film and add a lot of charm to the proceedings jackie chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings all in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue in cheek humour
<START> i used to think that it couldn't get worse that army of the dead but this load of crap makes the <UNK> mentioned movie look like the godfather the special effects are horrible makes the original <UNK> graphics look like <UNK> when it comes the acting put it this way i went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an oscar worthy performance when compared to these d list and that's being kind about it actors and actresses so basically if i had a gun to my head and head to chose between watching this movie again or <UNK> my own arm off with a dull knife that's a tough choice you know what who needs two arms anyways
<START> i caught the north american premiere of this at the chicago international film festival i was beyond disappointed from the mood in the audience i wasn't the only one br br the film takes a long time to get to the conflict and then refuses to resolve it <UNK> instead to tell us the story is to be continued is it a spoiler to reveal that a movie has no ending i consider it more of a warning this is at best only half a movie and not the good half
<START> my santa <UNK> choir was chosen to be in this movie all 100 plus when it came time to film the movie i was asked to chose just 10 oh my goodness we had a little gal who went early to have her <UNK> out because she wanted to be in the movie the choices were hard to make the people of <UNK> are just a lovely as the people that they show in the movie <UNK> kind <UNK> the town <UNK> an <UNK> christmas market the first two weekend in december every year i was there this year and it was wonderful the town is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical the town appears today as it did when the movie was made much credit goes to the historical society there that work hard to maintain the historical value the principal of the school that has been turned into a <UNK> school was given an award by the <UNK> of <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it so if you're not a fan of dry humor dark humor or back handed humor you probably could find something else to do if you are however this is quirky with some nice twists and a flowing natural dialog br br the story itself is quite engaging not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot your eyes but close i mean that in the best way possible the <UNK> are plenty the twists are enough to fully engage the senses and the characters are downright lovable br br i had a great time with this movie br br it rates an 8 3 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this movie is my all time favorite movie it has great acting cute guys and a great plot sean <UNK> is great in this movie it has funny moments sad moments and happy moments who could ask for anything more this movie is great
<START> frankly i met real han <UNK> <UNK> before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can't hollywood get nancy <UNK> instead at least its more true to the story <UNK> for goodness sake dr han <UNK> <UNK> is chinese i know <UNK> i have meet her in person br br and looking at the whole cast so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too br br i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of <UNK> br br its just like another movie i know of ' the imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as <UNK> khan br br and to make matter worst how on earth can a man born an <UNK> in <UNK> come up with a <UNK> southern accent and a cheap imitation of anything asian br br good grief br br i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin <UNK> king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white <UNK> show br br would love to see that br br and laugh the whole roof off br br cheers
<START> with old razor <UNK> can i help it if i'm not cousin basil i think the <UNK> out of tune ginger grey this is your little laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold <UNK> and opera singers they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap wonder how many times they <UNK> the scene with the phone booth adding christine <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> 2 frequent <UNK> to the mix makes it even better only <UNK> <UNK> is missing the stooges did some great individual scenes but this was their best overall
<START> during ww2 in the japanese soldiers are starving dying growing weak and becoming more and more insane a small group of soldiers trying to stay alive have eventually <UNK> to <UNK> this film perfectly portrays the insanity that <UNK> people under extreme conditions there are a few humorous parts in this movie but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death a very interesting film showing the death and the horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen
<START> when george <UNK> was told he could direct an american version of the book <UNK> <UNK> the movie <UNK> outside holland this movie has the name the <UNK> too he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed he was told that 'the american wouldn't <UNK> the original ending of course the original ending is much better and without it the movie loses its impact because i have already put this in the trivia section i won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler free if you want to know the original ending watch <UNK> or read the book this movie is absolute rubbish and the first <UNK> sutherland movie i don't like watch the original dutch movie which is one of the best thrillers in the world
<START> found an old vhs version of this film in my parents house so i thought i'd give it a go right from the start i wasn't expecting much from this film and i'm glad for that because overall the film was no good br br the acting overall was very poor even for a nicolas cage movie one scene with a radio <UNK> stands out as being so pitiful that i found it hilarious that this scene wasn't cut the first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and i didn't know what was going on br br the story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film i managed to watch the whole thing but i won't likely ever see this film again
<START> an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script inept direction and some of the worst score that i have ever heard more tv movie of the week than serious drama which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring in my opinion one the most blatant forms of cut and <UNK> film adapting
<START> george remake of his own superior film is a complete waste of time why was it even attempted <UNK> sutherland plays jeff whose girlfriend sandra <UNK> who only has a small amount of screen time is <UNK> at a service station by barney cousins jeff bridges now barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of <UNK> he <UNK> about like <UNK> monster but without the sympathy and <UNK> acting is totally awful sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest rita baker nancy travis br br a major problem with this version of 'the <UNK> is its obvious need to <UNK> to hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable and completely <UNK> the story however by this time the damage has been done as jeff bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh
<START> unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the columbia <UNK> for all eternity a shame since this may be jack strongest film and features a witty script by a young <UNK> <UNK> and fully realized performances by its two leads <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> forrest who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a <UNK> restaurant many standout scenes include <UNK> by <UNK> and electric razor and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as it's being torn down by a <UNK> ball
<START> to soccer fans every where stay away from this movie it was so lame acting lame script lame soccer and no directing i rented this movie during my <UNK> in asia and was appalled that this was considered one of the better <UNK> films it was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring there are thousands of rich exciting stories in asia why write a bad story about over the top and stereotypical <UNK>
<START> remember when rick <UNK> was funny 22 minutes was a great show when rick <UNK> was on it and made in canada was a great show once too talking to americans was such a funny special too but like my friend said rick <UNK> woke up one day and wasn't funny any more i think that day was when rick <UNK> report went on the air what is the point of this show rick <UNK> reads wacky fake <UNK> shows pictures of bad <UNK> that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on tv and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh we're supposed to be interested in seeing rick <UNK> visit a <UNK> team and then try to do some of their moves and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be funny rick <UNK> got old or just lost interest or just ain't funny any more even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor you can say that about cbc comedy in general though because how many years have they been sticking air farce on tv to deliver the same kinds of useless jokes
<START> this show <UNK> state has an almost project feel to it as in you're watching a <UNK> that's actually just a scripted movie made to look and feel like a documentary br br my biggest problem with the show is their <UNK> <UNK> outside <UNK> of the <UNK> who were made famous for their of the <UNK> murders which were shown to be completely <UNK> just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths such as the <UNK> daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths then there's the way they constantly jump to <UNK> demons for everything not to mention how <UNK> the group is about what cases they take they don't want to help those who need it most they just want the <UNK> cases that will get them the most press and attention br br they're complete <UNK> plain and simple
<START> there seem to be many fans of this movie here but i found it boring slow meandering and pointless and i watch and enjoy plenty of art house and independent films so i wasn't expecting an action movie i didn't sympathize with either character the guy from the countryside was a bad guest and didn't seem to be trying very hard to find a job and his relative in <UNK> was <UNK> and closed off emotionally br br in an interview on the dvd the director says that the movie is about a common situation in turkey the person leaving in the countryside because there are no jobs and coming to <UNK> and staying with relatives while trying to find work that in itself is interesting but the movie wasn't
<START> this is an account of events that have been covered in print several times and i had read two books 'a voyage for and 'the strange last voyage of donald before seeing the film in <UNK> just before christmas i must say it <UNK> all expectations in its telling of the 1968 sunday times golden globe <UNK> race these men set out to do something that had never been done before with no support <UNK> wooden <UNK> no satellite phones no <UNK> and just their wits and skill to get them round the globe in one piece not to mention the months of <UNK> the <UNK> southern ocean little sleep and <UNK> that were often literally falling apart around them br br this documentary is excellently put together in my opinion tightly edited well paced with superb narration the archive footage and the interviews are fascinating and bring the story to life <UNK> interview footage is especially revealing and moving as she relates the events that led up to her husband donald departure from the doubts and fears in his mind and her reaction as subsequent events <UNK> br br i was moved and had even shed a tear or two by the time the credits started rolling and <UNK> other people expressing similar feelings br br the two books i mentioned above are useful for more detail and back story which couldn't have been <UNK> into the 90 minutes and i would recommend those too br br this is ultimately a true story of human courage and human <UNK> a must see for anyone interested in <UNK> adventure human <UNK> and real life heroes
<START> my husband brought this home from the video store so i could watch something while stuck home sick the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book but a sorta silly light romantic flick sounds just right that and a bowl of chicken soup well he meant well br br my first thought as some others post here also was that the house must be fake it's not only isolated alone on the beach but set on into the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house this looks so obviously dangerous in <UNK> country in the fall so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply <UNK> the whole thing or used movie magic to <UNK> a cute b b into the surf br br but i have to tell you guys thanks to i can say that the house <UNK> is very real is indeed near and except for some window dressing and <UNK> appears mostly as it does in the film you can rent it yourself off season for a week or about in summer go for it but interestingly the house has severe problems the second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the <UNK> <UNK> in that surf and sure enough <UNK> was condemned for a break in the <UNK> caused by from the ocean they are <UNK> br br and the house isn't from the civil war not to mention that <UNK> davis playing cliché black best friend <UNK> role for a fine actress last seen in doubt is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war hello that was 150 years ago try great great great in reality <UNK> was built in 1988 laughably recently br br the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks <UNK> which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable <UNK> it is also aimed in a very <UNK> way towards women you know us women who love b <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> who dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the <UNK> don't give us plot or thoughtful character development just set up some <UNK> and bring on the love scenes br br gere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a <UNK> on her cheek of course she died of an <UNK> of <UNK> so you wonder right away why the surgeon is <UNK> up and not the <UNK> hello where is that guy why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty br br gere has come to <UNK> and confront the woman's husband and is staying at the remote b b who should be there why the only other person in the <UNK> diane lane she's a lonely <UNK> with rotten kids and an ex <UNK> who wants her back while she's trying to decide about that the cliché best black friend has her <UNK> as <UNK> at the b b br br now in the real world if this set up ever even happened the doctor would look like ernest <UNK> and the lonely <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> he'd spend his vacation <UNK> 22 year old girls on the beach while she <UNK> and thought about going on a <UNK> but this isn't the real world i <UNK> br br the couple confess all fall in love a <UNK> hits they make love fall in love he has to go away he dies and she cries a lot about that the end br br there i've saved you from it now you don't have to torture yourself or any male <UNK> husbands sons boyfriends from sitting through this tripe very <UNK> br br someone else asked why diane lane a perfect tiny woman whom filmmakers seem to love to cast because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her but she's and not over the top so she isn't threatening is constantly covered in big <UNK> like <UNK> this would make sense if she was <UNK> but she isn't br br anyways someone throw a pretty <UNK> <UNK> over this film so we don't have to watch it conclusion read a book unless you are too sick if too sick go to sleep
<START> in <UNK> the priest owen vincent <UNK> hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that is missing while <UNK> the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city br br i bought this dvd based on the name of val kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover i am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i do not understand how val kilmer accepted to participate in this production there are two shameful reviews in imdb promoting this movie and they are typically fake written by users with only one review in this site there are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film my wife and i many times because of the <UNK> of this pointless story and we used the <UNK> button of the dvd to repeat each lost scene however the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button to end this crap faster my vote is one br br title brazil dark city

<START> this film <UNK> miserably in the uk and it didn't deserve to the trailer of this film is slightly misleading and i guess it <UNK> critics and audiences into thinking it was <UNK> part 2 while the film was <UNK> that way to <UNK> on the earlier success of joe <UNK> <UNK> winning film it's very different in tone it focuses on an imagination of sorts of <UNK> poet dylan <UNK> life during the second world war as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to <UNK> director john quickly introduces <UNK> matthew <UNK> childhood sweetheart vera phillips played by <UNK> knightley she was <UNK> first love in their <UNK> but the moment has passed and singer vera only wants it as a beautiful memory or does she vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in <UNK> life queen of ireland love of my life mother of my child <UNK> thomas <UNK> miller the three form a sort of <UNK> a <UNK> in war struck london but vera then falls for a dashing soldier william cillian murphy they quickly marry with leaving for war a frightened vera convinces the <UNK> to return her to <UNK> but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of <UNK> child <UNK> jealousy and shell shock after returning home and <UNK> <UNK> she cannot share dylan with her best friend br br filmed on a low budget this is more of a mood piece than anything else it works best as a <UNK> that some memories and feelings need to be <UNK> but not <UNK> the performance of <UNK> miller is particularly unfortunately the <UNK> nonsense <UNK> from the fact thats she's quite a talent and knightley and murphy are once again very good the let down is rhys as dylan who while the <UNK> poet himself was no bed of <UNK> lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in dylan the writing is very choppy some beautiful moments interspersed with <UNK> it's certainly worth watching however
<START> a <UNK> shop owner in nyc played by <UNK> <UNK> valerie gets put on a us district court jury on a trial of a known <UNK> <UNK> rusty and most of this very slow paced film revolves around attempts of attempting to get <UNK> to <UNK> him of murder by threatening to kill her son and herself much action ensues involving gruesome mob rub outs with <UNK> hurt as the go between much of this silly disjointed mess <UNK> hurt and obsession with <UNK> courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again and an ending that is unbelievable 3 10 is probably going easy on this waste of time
<START> i just watched this move for the <UNK> or <UNK> time and am still in love with it it still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate br br i almost wrote bonnie hunt a letter to tell her how much i love it david <UNK> grief scene is so <UNK> real <UNK> driver is so natural and honest my favorite line is when duchovny says i miss elizabeth but i <UNK> for grace oh man i'm crying just thinking about it also bonnie hunt and jim belushi are the perfect chicago area couple i know them i swear i'm related to them i'm sure br br this movie is in my three times a year <UNK> i'd watch it once a week but i'm afraid i'd get too used to it i always want to make it a special day when i watch it
<START> one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by <UNK> in an attempt to <UNK> boost this film's ratings br br this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre in fact it is laughably bad in acting and cinematography and derivative in its plot the make up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot lines are <UNK> delivered and badly timed with the exception of the female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this mess of a film the worst <UNK> are the italian guy hans the protagonist and the lead bad guy i've seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire br br this is a self <UNK> zombie western but about the only thing that makes this a zombie western is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actor's real name is clint the protagonist isn't cool and mysterious like a traditional eastwood hero and as an anti hero he doesn't have the wise cracking attitude to pull it off either br br don't be fooled by the fake glowing reviews this is just another b grade zombie movie that's competently made for the budget it had it does have some decent lighting but it <UNK> of low budget first time directing and bad acting there are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish
<START> i just watched return from <UNK> <UNK> and it was very good i've seen a lot of negative comments about it and i don't think the viewers are being real about it in the television movie business it is hard to get all the actors back for a 2nd sequel or 3rd part we are lucky to have another miniseries that ties into lone d <UNK> this production was top notch with the original music score and the actors put their hearts into it you can tell if you want to watch <UNK> d with robert duvall and tommy l j then watch the original return to l d didn't have as much wit and takes on a more serious tone but is totally captivating none the less from the touching moments to the villains this one is a winner wonderful
<START> i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection my wife suggested it was one of these 3 for <UNK> deals at a high street store the thing isn't worth let alone <UNK> <UNK> having invested heavily in it i felt duty bound to watch it to the end just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through and it was br br the dialog was awful the story line was <UNK> i still don't understand what the hell was going on despite having read the synopsis the camera work was disjointed and hopeless the acting was wooden not helped by the dialogue br br in fact there were no redeeming features no not even the lovely sandra <UNK> on whose <UNK> subsequent career this pile of <UNK> has probably been sold she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it <UNK> br br as a final amusing example of the director's <UNK> there was a scene where the young lead is <UNK> with his father's ex army sidekick while driving this was the <UNK> bit of dialogue in the film no engine noise whatsoever i look forward to the engine technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars
<START> i don't know why all of the critics say this was a bad movie this is one of my all time favorite movies tommy chris <UNK> and richard david spade are a great match tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college finally passing with a d richard is the smart kid who was hated by everyone in school how can you not laugh when the two of them are singing superstar by the <UNK> and all of a sudden the hood pops up in all this is a great movie i recommend it
<START> if you don't have anything better to do then go ahead and rent this movie it's intelligent funny it will sure have your attention busy for a while br br i discover it by surfing channels in a boring sunday it was on cable and for the faces i saw i thought it may worth the try it made me laugh and for a movie in a sunday with nothing else on tv it was ok br br <UNK> tyler looks amazing in the movie even though her acting is not what i expected it's kind of poor acting and for the rest of the crew i liked <UNK> in her role as a dr also i found interesting seeing the guy from the sitcom what i like about you playing an almost gay lawyer br br as for j goodman i found it as always a very good performance michael douglas plays a small role but his characterization was hard for me to identify him br br it's also a good movie to watch with company
<START> there is a lot wrong with this movie it can be said that doing a sequel to halloween was a bad idea in the first place and we should feel lucky that the previous entries even at their lowest were still watchable but even still halloween the curse of michael myers even today is so bad it's shocking poor movie making at it's worst indeed there is so much blame to go around but where to begin whose shoulders does this blame rest on br br was it director joe style over substance directing well at the very least the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front and as far the visual effects go you get to see michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways even if it doesn't quite fit in with the overall tone of the series br br so could daniel troubled script be the <UNK> well to be fair he did the best he could by the time you reach the sixth entry in any series you're running out of places to go finding a rhyme to michael's reason isn't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one especially the way it's handled here and it really doesn't help that the movie was <UNK> to pieces and <UNK> back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the end br br perhaps dimension <UNK> could have <UNK> the whole thing <UNK> this was the first studio film in the halloween series and we all know what happens when too many <UNK> get in the kitchen heck look at the unbelievable <UNK> they dragged <UNK> to i guess everyone is to blame because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick br br the bottom line though is that no matter how you cut it slice it <UNK> it or <UNK> it until it's head explodes halloween the curse of michael myers was never a good film <UNK> an all time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for michael myers curse is just that cursed the thorn angle was never interesting nor was it probably expanded upon the needless gore is so out of place and <UNK> the tension that is the trademark of the halloween name towards the end the movie stops making sense stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost it's sad that donald <UNK> final performance is <UNK> in this film even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions and for the most part there's other strong cast members in this film paul rudd plays the weird anti social adult tommy doyle rather naturally while <UNK> <UNK> does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead on the other side of the <UNK> the re casting of jamie lloyd was a shame and thank god <UNK> <UNK> doesn't do movies anymore as the child in the film being pursued by the man in black danny is the anti jamie in that he is annoying whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role it's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film but i guess that's halloween 6 in a nutshell essentially this is the anti halloween made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda hell even the music is bad many will try to paint this as the edgy halloween because of it's sci fi twist but really it's just stupid save for some good visuals and decent characters the curse of michael myers is just about as bad as it gets and this is coming from a fan
<START> i liked half life i am still it's fan it was frightening intelligent and challenging i don't tell any news it is one the best <UNK> ever made maybe i'm too hardcore half life fan but the so called half life 2 is not half life 2 br br and i have a question is this the next chapter of half life maybe the creators <UNK> thinks so but i don't where are the intelligent enemies where is the frightening atmosphere nowhere i believe they wanted to make a bit different half life instead of another research station story but they didn't just made a very different one they made something that has to do with half life like for example <UNK> does to doom the entire game so <UNK> and unreal that it's almost <UNK> br br though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play the idea to make a revolutionary driven <UNK> has utterly failed when you get the gravity gun that can move objects you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon that would turn the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> upside down the truth is you can't use gravity gun as a real weapon why because the best you can do is throwing boxes and <UNK> that don't do much damage if you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots if you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own hand the gravity gun doesn't work as a weapon the best usage is solving some <UNK> i ask <UNK> why the truth is you must use your boring <UNK> <UNK> weapons to the end except for last level weapons are not that made original half life a classic if gravity gun would be always like at the last level a real weapon i'd admire what <UNK> did but not this this is disappointing br br so if you want half life then you are searching at the wrong place maybe you will enjoy it but i repeat it is everything but not half life and even not a faithful <UNK> of that this is the greatest disappointment of all time <UNK> have shown they can make awful games too they have managed that
<START> i don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad it was great classic bruce campbell yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a bruce movie for you watch it for bruce also ted was excellent i found this movie hilarious and entertaining i still crack up when i recall bruce on that pink <UNK> now i will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like b movies you probably won't like this one if you <UNK> big budget effects and actors steer clear but if you like slap stick and off the wall sci fi plots this movie is for you br br <UNK> the king baby
<START> there are so many things wrong with this movie i don't even know where to begin the story is not cohesive at all i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his her head in confusion br br here's what i remember of the movie before i was bored into <UNK> a quasi abusive dad chases some pre teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all in the next scene the girls are about 15 they're driving with their parents and hit a deer the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up one sister drags the other from the burning <UNK> then the girls are <UNK> in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky and start a new life in the very next scene the girls are <UNK> toward a military base and what a military base it is actually it's more like a <UNK> farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing soldiers the base office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an <UNK> <UNK> hanging on the wall and a <UNK> sergeant hat <UNK> to a <UNK> so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go into town to buy some porn <UNK> and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the pink team so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck to town and loads up a box from a <UNK> book store with a <UNK> doll by the front door the girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up and look through the porn <UNK> to find items inside like the <UNK> <UNK> i guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away plot aside the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the <UNK> sister meets the main character for the first time or how the camera <UNK> way too long on certain shots to try to convey a message br br if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever stay away it's not worth the money in either case
<START> this movie didn't do it for me an avid snl fan for the past 14 years jamie portrayal was ok but there was something so off putting about the movie itself the facts presented in the movie are totally <UNK> but <UNK> produced it so that would explain a lot he was never on snl nor had anything to do with it the points in her life when she was on snl are backwards when we first see her on snl walking through the studio with <UNK> michaels the <UNK> on the wall is circa 1988 1989 not 1975 and let's talk about the cast who are these people i have never heard of a one of them truly <UNK> this movie shows why tv movies are just that tv movies
<START> it's not a movie but an experience br br not the usual eye candy i thought it would be too many things are happening at once your senses almost couldn't handle it a product of cutting edge technology we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3d glasses on and off to <UNK> the magic the music is great it's a concert the disney characters are in it and you get to be part of their world it's funny it's magical it's exciting i know this is beginning to sound like an <UNK> but it really is that awesome beats christmas in bringing out the kid in you br br this attraction alone already makes going to disney all worth it
<START> with great expectations i went to see this film <UNK> contribution to the oscar race this year part from being completely pointless banal pathetic badly written edited acted and directed the movie is too long it fails in delivering the message it tries to give fails in its storytelling clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm there are some so extreme <UNK> i haven't seen in a movie in a long time the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head the divine revelations all that lizard nonsense the spanish speaking audience around me was <UNK> and rapidly losing patience and some of the <UNK> i <UNK> was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest
<START> <UNK> <UNK> plays an elite who is supposed to have knocked off a tv reporter for a group of bad guys but once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the tv <UNK> life is <UNK> the life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment such is the basis for a movie called supreme <UNK> br br supreme waste of time is more like it we see character beat up <UNK> and kill men far bigger than her and she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who can't for some reason do away with this super having one woman do away and beat all these men makes the movie seem so gay it is too predictable once you figure character is going to win out anyway thus making the film boring and inept br br <UNK> <UNK> is decent actress who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes supreme <UNK> is not one of her better efforts however
<START> if you are going to make a movie from any book be sure that the characters are with that book this movie not only <UNK> the biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try at least the lord of the rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this <UNK> <UNK> tried to
<START> garden state is another of these indie type pictures that supposedly <UNK> on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true to life human drama oddly enough the production is very good so are the performances by some fairly big name actors as well where the picture is lacking is in <UNK> script which seems mostly <UNK> from situations taken from other movies br br when you're as young as is you haven't really lived enough to use the experience as film fodder experience looks to be from watching movies then repeating the same trite clichés in his own movie in garden state he plays andrew a semi successful hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in new jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years he appears to have no feeling about any of this he has no relationship with his father who blames him for causing his mother's <UNK> in a freak accident as a six year old and has no particular <UNK> over losing his mother in fact he <UNK> a party right after the burial to which he was invited by a friend of his who works as a cemetery grave <UNK> it all <UNK> heavily of beautiful girls also about a guy who returns to his hometown to find himself and hang with his old friends with a little ordinary people thrown in on the side br br it's really a miracle could accomplish anything at all in his life given his father and his useless friends i'm surprised he didn't kill himself who are still living their lives as though they're still in high school <UNK> with dumb <UNK> drinking and <UNK> etc none of them even recognize him from his tv role as the retarded <UNK> natalie <UNK> character the most aware person in the movie does and say things like hey i remember you from junior year these guys are such losers for them watching television would be a cultural leap forward even one friend who made millions <UNK> a silent has no real reason to live because his whole frame of reference is high school and <UNK> and you don't need big money to party like a high school <UNK> br br it is revealed is heavily <UNK> which keeps from feeling and dealing with anything really like an adult would then he meets sam natalie portman a sort of lost girl who gives pet <UNK> and lives with her mother like a 10 year old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown up to life size anyway they fall in love and learns to feel again the clichés come fast and furious has a long <UNK> heart to heart talk with his cold <UNK> father and tells him what it is and the name of the game in one scene and portman are in the millionaire kid's house playing <UNK> <UNK> is front of a giant <UNK> and the bit is so routine so standard movie <UNK> i swear i half expected somebody to walk up and throw a <UNK> into the fire in another visits a doctor ron <UNK> to get his junk and <UNK> tells him in easily the worst line in the movie the body can play tricks on you i once found my ex best friend's in my wife's purse and i didn't have an <UNK> for a year and a half obviously no <UNK> <UNK> would ever say that but it's <UNK> poetry a nod from to i guess his loser friends to let them know he's still thinking of them just as the <UNK> joke in <UNK> was kevin smith's nod to his <UNK> buddies br br anyway finds true happiness and gets off the <UNK> the story plays itself out predictably but if you're going to have a movie that's wall to wall clichés at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it and does he has the right sort of <UNK> of casual acceptance to make his role as the <UNK> out andrew both real and poignant and natalie portman also of beautiful girls gives the movie a big lift with her tiny features and <UNK> expressions of mood she just about steals the picture as his traveling companion jean smart is surprisingly good as <UNK> mother and peter <UNK> though much better in <UNK> glass is notable as the <UNK> friend i would recommend garden state if you can't get enough <UNK> romance out of movies but when people start <UNK> it as a masterpiece they're just clueless thinks you can take the same old tired plot write in a few f <UNK> and and slap on an <UNK> rock soundtrack and that the material it doesn't
<START> i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival 2005 only a few days ago i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life i also love the majority of <UNK> cinematic offerings there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and <UNK> i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and <UNK>
<START> let's just say that it might be the worst movie i've ever seen on the front of the box of the movie it says something about it resembling <UNK> dogs i fell for it hook line and <UNK> this is just a warning message to anyone who might read this it's not even worth renting when you want something to laugh at
<START> this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man <UNK> the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person
<START> so when bob and marion see a guy at a hotel marion believes it is her long lost brother brian but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face marion manages to get his <UNK> and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after <UNK> his <UNK> they get a hold of brian but still he doesn't know what they are talking about but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either the plot <UNK> and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well experiments made out on people only to make the perfect <UNK> yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors they seemed bored and lost 3 out of 10 a little suspense yes but that's it
<START> now i myself had previously seen a few episodes of the of gentleman which i found hilarious when i brought the film i was not sure if i knew enough about the series to get it boy was i wrong this is one of the best comedy films i have seen ever and the clever acting of the makes the film it has a very good and funny plot as well as using only a few characters at any one time helps because it doesn't make it too confusing which would have <UNK> the film even if you have never seen the of gentleman get this film it will make you laugh and this is a film that can be watched more then once and is an excellent film to watch with your mates it truly deserves it review a definite 10 out of 10
<START> talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first br br i have to admit i didn't watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance br br this would not even be good as a made for tv flick br br <UNK>
<START> this review contains spoilers i didn't have any expectations about this movie i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie white noise br br first the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it the pacing from start to finish is <UNK> the main <UNK> don't like to wear a <UNK> and the director appears to enjoy the <UNK> effect as anna <UNK> <UNK> the stairs if you like movies for <UNK> this one has a low level buzz factor br br second it's nice that the movie rips off elements of <UNK> and other horror genre <UNK> but in better movies there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior this stinker tries to establish some sense of <UNK> and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've <UNK> a treasure <UNK> of potentially <UNK> <UNK> evidence and <UNK> <UNK> are nicely spelled out in a <UNK> book on <UNK> <UNK> like on buffy i was waiting for miles to show up and give some <UNK> on how to <UNK> a certain demon type of so and so br br the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat <UNK> effect on you ho hum to do this you need to have a <UNK> circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them this opens the world to the age of darkness at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult <UNK> which raises the annoying question of uh well how did the ones who wrote the book know and if this is what happens would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness an age brought on by <UNK> who could have performed this like much earlier using the occult practices to bring the world to darkness for <UNK> 2nd edition it turns out the father in the story is the <UNK> child the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago he was released by his father who is the doctor grandfather in the movie who wanted to try the ritual with presumably other stupid parents who just wanted to see if dumb sh t like this opening the world to darkness actually works the grandpa let the father go because he didn't really love him stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of auteur there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction the whole movie is like this people seeing really weird sh t going on and not <UNK> to it in any sort of normal way must be bad plot and direction br br anna <UNK> does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a <UNK> and she does look <UNK> in a <UNK> top but at several critical moments in the story her character doesn't bother to call in for back up you know more of the same i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying <UNK> or <UNK> even though i sense impending doom and even dumber as it may seem even if you bring on the age of darkness these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source but they appear as people you know and tell you to turn off the light source reminds me of the video game alone in the dark maybe this movie is a rip off of that <UNK> concept br br the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna they both die at the end the entire family dies the darkness creatures lead them to their death but really the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death the other adults could be <UNK> with any other actors from the red shoes <UNK> series of fine cinema br br so to wrap up the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in <UNK> around <UNK> in an obviously <UNK> situation the really crap plot there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a <UNK> <UNK> hidden in it the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because well no real reason they couldn't find the kids but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he <UNK> about what is going on inside the hackneyed use of scare <UNK> more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs and blood on the <UNK> and the <UNK> of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies br br is it entertaining at speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on it can be entertaining until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap otherwise it on the cinematic equivalent of a <UNK> shake the empty are horrid br br the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen the ring and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood which in this respect the film fails miserably and so also in this respect it is my opinion that you suck at what you do
<START> 1st watched 10 28 2007 8 out of 10 <UNK> jesus simple sweet story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures surviving in the everyday world without a roof over their heads the movie starts with the woman in the story played by <UNK> being released from prison but we don't know what she was in for or how long she was there she runs across the anti hero of the story and her boyfriend played by sebastian as he's parking cars for change they shack up together underneath an old <UNK> building with nothing but each other's warmth and a small <UNK> to their possession he is a drug addict who just tries to make it from one fix to another but she has a strange obsessive attraction to him as a person which we eventually accept he also has some sort of sexually <UNK> disease so sex for them is out of the question but this doesn't appear to be a problem for either of them she loves this man as he is without question and without him having to change which is a rare find anywhere she earns her keep by carrying a bucket around and <UNK> shop windows they eat a <UNK> roll every day and consider it a feast <UNK> character dreams of a normal life but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect to fit into that role so doesn't think much of it both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their <UNK> without giving up much of the story <UNK> character continues to <UNK> while the man gets worse and worse in his drug obsession there is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story that lifts it up for the masses to enjoy but overall this is a wonderful independent film about a relationship between un <UNK> <UNK> that keeps you interested until the end
<START> death machines takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie <UNK> martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime <UNK> opponents and turns it into an unwatchable mess i have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget bad acting and incoherent script released as a so called movie it's easily the worst martial arts action oriented movie i've seen in years <UNK> even ninja holocaust which at least had some good energetic fight scenes br br the actual star of the movie is the white death machine it's basically his vehicle so he is featured <UNK> in many more scenes than his two <UNK> he's in good shape and he's not bad looking but as an actor he's barely there think chuck norris in the <UNK> only without any energy or emotion this is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director but you have to be arnold to pull this kind of thing off and this guy is no arnold br br the movie and the director can't seem to find the time or the budget to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally <UNK> like who was the shadowy figure giving the mouthed asian lady her orders how did the gang war end why did the <UNK> mouthed asian lady decide to have her zombie <UNK> killed and what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a <UNK> like a <UNK> stick br br it does however find the time to film a completely <UNK> bar fight in which a sailor well he looked like <UNK> destroys a bar because the <UNK> box didn't work it's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also k o 's the movie's hero a bartender karate student who was a victim of the death machines first major assignment he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher it follows this up with one of the most un called for love scenes between the hero and his girlfriend i have ever watched the <UNK> makes no sense at the end of the bar fight she's <UNK> over his <UNK> limp body and the next thing they are in a <UNK> shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a hallmark card btw we never see the sailor again br br and wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked br br the movie is a <UNK> case of poor casting and community theater level actors <UNK> without decent direction the three death machines come across as <UNK> the hero knows his lines but can't carry the movie given that his character is an <UNK> <UNK> his girlfriend is a charisma <UNK> and all the other minor parts are barely watchable all this makes for a fairly poor movie but the dragon lady does more to drag the movie into <UNK> stinker territory than anyone or anything else she looks ridiculous her tiny <UNK> face is <UNK> by her ton o hair <UNK> wig she wears her red <UNK> dress like a and she talks with a terrible <UNK> mouth delivery that screams needed time with a dialog coach poor lady she was obviously way out of her element and as far as i know never appeared in a film again br br add to this a low budget one <UNK> soundtrack that never <UNK> up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting crappy film stock and lighting fight choreography that is strictly from <UNK> and a general all around <UNK> and lack of energy in the <UNK> and the stage business and you have one lame movie br br i got this as part of a 50 movie dvd <UNK> so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it it wasn't worth it <UNK>
<START> ill <UNK> <UNK> abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant <UNK> with <UNK> picking <UNK> keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant <UNK> of <UNK> after a year of office terror the working stiff finally cracks writer director george <UNK> has possibly bit off more than he can chew here his swimming with sharks isn't a <UNK> against hollywood nor is it a tribute to the hard working <UNK> instead it's stunt film making with a twist a one trick <UNK> with tunnel vision the surroundings don't look or feel like <UNK> town perhaps due to a limited budget and we never get a sense of this <UNK> environment as a movie making <UNK> it could be a office in the valley for all we know lead kevin spacey who also served as one of the film's producers gives a controlled and focused performance as the power mad <UNK> whose ego is out of control he does good work and yet the character doesn't ring true we learn so little about him and his <UNK> that his important position and high <UNK> status fail to <UNK> with what we do see who does this man answer to what drives him beyond <UNK> others for sport what projects is he <UNK> aside from the one script we see passed around the film is so emotionally <UNK> and <UNK> it begins to seem like a stage play padded out for the big screen and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it perhaps <UNK> wanted to keep things simple but instead his movie looks like a half baked project which needed a lot more insight humor and atmosphere from
<START> yes i realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie <UNK> <UNK> but it cannot be said enough scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from <UNK> <UNK> script with only superficial changes you can expect to see br br the <UNK> arrogant scene i am the voice of god everything else is meaningless br br the <UNK> making fun of the mediocre <UNK> work complete with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just like in <UNK> br br the mediocre <UNK> dialogue with god why do you <UNK> me with music but deny me the ability to <UNK> br br the musical from the <UNK> scene common time begin with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br and the list goes on br br the problem is even worse not only were these scenes shamelessly copied they weren't even done very well <UNK> if you're going to rip off an original at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way br br no wait there's something even worse than that it's the fact that the director tried to beat the story of <UNK> into the story of <UNK> folks <UNK> was not a crass vulgar <UNK> the way this movie portrays him furthermore <UNK> was not a <UNK> idiot who takes <UNK> from his <UNK> a 23 year old music student unfortunately films like this are responsible for <UNK> history br br and another thing <UNK> in real life never called it the <UNK> <UNK> the way he does in the movie that name was given by a confused critic some years after <UNK> died and unfortunately it stuck but <UNK> original title was quasi <UNK> <UNK> br br and another thing when <UNK> in the movie yells b flat b flat b flat and hits the note on the piano he's hitting a white key br br and another <UNK> in real life was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his <UNK> <UNK> this movie shows him as having barely a minor <UNK> saying what every other line just enough to be annoying br br the american accents oh never mind just never mind i've wasted enough time on this already go see <UNK> again then if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of <UNK> see immortal beloved which takes poetic liberties but at least they're interesting ideas lastly if you want to see something on the lighter side check out <UNK> a film about <UNK> but aside from those three i've never seen a good homage to a classical composer
<START> there's only 2 reasons i watch this show i invested the time already in previous episodes and <UNK> for all you supposed sci fi fans out there who love the new bsg give me a break go read some classic sci fi novels by the true <UNK> or watch some of the <UNK> films and tv shows from days gone by and you'll see what <UNK> these bsg writers are their only gimmick is who is the fifth <UNK> poor writing and really truly no sense of character development if <UNK> or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time <UNK> and <UNK> is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship out the <UNK> with her i could care less if it's six more months before they conclude these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one if you don't know that you just don't know writing
<START> if you want a complete waste of time because pulling <UNK> out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or your <UNK> is your idea of a carnival thrill ride then you'll not want to miss this one br br for one thing forget the vhs cover no body in this movie looks that attractive ie the indian girl someone else commented that whoever <UNK> for the cover is not the same girl and i agree the cover is the most exciting thing about this movie br br to put this in perspective i bought this vhs for 99 cents at k mart and three minutes no 40 seconds into the movie i knew i had been ripped off br br i finished watching it because 1 i did pay 99 cents after all and 2 there might possibly <UNK> been a hair of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a <UNK> <UNK> br br there wasn't br br good grief fonda i know you were hard up for roles when you did this but this is beneath you
<START> to regard the film as nothing more than a documentary about <UNK> would fail to recognize several important aspects of <UNK> <UNK> a well known <UNK> figure himself has crafted a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as <UNK> but also <UNK> the <UNK> cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport emerged and gained wide appeal in addition his film is rather personal <UNK> first hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves as both the informed cinematic investigator and the involved <UNK> subject in this role he is a quintessential <UNK> <UNK> while gathering together a wide array of personalities whom were integral to this movement and those who were profoundly affected by the <UNK> of <UNK> as a <UNK> sport and <UNK> the film employs a uniquely <UNK> form of film and sound editing and the narration by sean penn and interviews adopt a rather genuine <UNK> form that is akin with the <UNK> <UNK> spirit of sidewalk surfing the film <UNK> the <UNK> appeal of a <UNK> sporting music video <UNK> with an sensitivity to the importance of time place and <UNK>
<START> dude i thought this movie <UNK> perfect for just sitting around alone and watching at like <UNK> with just you and a bottle the whole time you are watching it you are thinking wtf what's gonna happen next dude just get with the chick already alright they are <UNK> this is odd but kinda creepy cool damn this whole movie has an erotic dirty naughty cold evil <UNK> to it it's subtle dance just keeps you drawn to it you're just waiting for someone to get whacked but damn wtf you get that and then some for the morally <UNK> stomach it is great running to the toilet to <UNK> material any movie that can get that kinda reaction out of you deserves an award
<START> never posted anything here before but after watching i just felt that i had to write down my thoughts about it br br firstly do not compare this to blair witch this movie deserves far better than that simply put is probably one of the best horror movies i have ever seen and i have seen a lot br br i really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named <UNK> and his cameraman without spoiling to much about the plot i can say it that it starts with <UNK> doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to be connected to something far more darker and sinister br br while the story might not be that original in itself what really hooked me with was the incredibly eerie atmosphere if you're looking for cheap scares and seat jumping scenes this movie might not be for you this movie is all about the mood it presents with haunting images and a general feeling of foreboding suspense the documentary style filming just makes it farm more believable br br this is also helped a lot by the acting which is superb although not perfect for the general part of the movie far better than in most other movies in this type of genre br br well enough <UNK> from me i highly recommend to everyone it is suspenseful creepy well acted and the first movie that has scared me in ages
<START> a movie theater with a bad history of past gruesome murders <UNK> of course the bloody killings start <UNK> written directed shot scored and edited with an appalling lack of flair and <UNK> by the <UNK> talentless rick sloane who later <UNK> celluloid some more with the absolutely atrocious hobgoblins this <UNK> ham <UNK> attempt at a slasher spoof strikes out something rotten in every <UNK> way the excruciatingly <UNK> pacing the painfully static grainy cinematography there's a <UNK> <UNK> of drab master shots featured throughout an annoyingly <UNK> and redundant <UNK> score the flat non direction a <UNK> talky and <UNK> script the <UNK> inducing <UNK> sense of <UNK> humor the <UNK> murder set pieces a <UNK> <UNK> killer he's just some <UNK> up old guy in <UNK> make up the uniformly obnoxious and unappealing characters a abrupt ending and lifeless performances from a <UNK> uninspired cast all ensure that watching this <UNK> <UNK> is about as fun and rewarding as eating <UNK> raw <UNK> <UNK> with sour <UNK> this <UNK> totally lacks the necessary crude charm and sleazy <UNK> required to be enjoyable junk instead it's just a bland plodding and meandering stiff that never catches fire or becomes even remotely amusing in a so shoddy it's smoking sort of way only a <UNK> of nudity and the delightful presence of the always <UNK> mary <UNK> as a <UNK> <UNK> secretary provide a little relief from the overall of this lousy loser
<START> i don't know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment basically 2 <UNK> are put in <UNK> at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time the <UNK> of 4 judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game they will break down what the guy did wrong and what they guy did right some contestants are weak some are strong but what happens is always entertaining if you are a guy that goes out you can relate i've seen weak game i've seen strong game and this show is for real no doubt
<START> after seeing naked city and night and the city which is still my favorite <UNK> i was more than excited to watch his masterpiece o word <UNK> <UNK> br br now i am a little bit disappointed about the story br br so i have at least these five questions in my mind br br 1 in the final <UNK> louis shot from the inside a house the main character tony le he couldn't know if he is still alive or not but he didn't care about it and ran directly after it outside the house with the money to reach his car so of course tony wasn't dead and shot him big br br 2 in another important scene the <UNK> in <UNK> gave directly after the robbery as a present a diamond ring which was a part of the robbery a woman which was working for louis in a night bar stupid because before this character wasn't that stupid and of course louis knew directly that tony planned the jewel robbery small br br 3 after the gangsters behind louis murder mario and his wife tony and his best friend joe planned a revenge against louis gang at the same time they don't care for the security of <UNK> wife and his five years old child of course louis gang kidnapped the son cheap and simple br br 4 the perfect heist of course this is the best <UNK> long scene in the whole plot without any word spoken in the whole time but was this a perfect heist comparing with other movies which handle with this theme i could only smile when for example tony was taken a fire <UNK> to banned the alarm also too simple br br 5 the gang went to the house of mario because they knew however the <UNK> will be there then they murder mario and his wife and then they are not searching for it no they ran directly out of the apartment and more they not <UNK> the apartment after it so tony can go after a while which was the same day inside to take the <UNK> big br br over all it's a good movie because of the brilliant <UNK> silent heist scene because of the very good cut the end scene in the car through paris is stunning because of a very good actor called jean because of this black white fever you will get while watching it because of some other reasons too other user wrote about but please don't tell me this is a stunning story
<START> this is the result of the town of california making a home movie and <UNK> the rest of the world to it legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie part comedy part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and <UNK> in the area and going on a rampage the monster which we don't see until the final 20 minutes is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the <UNK> hour of boredom frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end this is a stinker
<START> i have never read the book but had always heard good things about it so when the movie came out i considered going to see it but never did now it has come out on dvd and i have thought of renting for a few weeks now last night i finally picked it up i am very glad that i did br br cinematography was incredible in this movie the scenery etc all made you feel like you were in <UNK> the acting was all very good although i am sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation and the story itself was good and pure and uplifting yes the story was very sad but at the same time uplifting br br and i will be honest as a white american made me see aside of <UNK> and afghanistan that i never picture in my mind when i think about it showed me a afghanistan before the <UNK> showed me a place that was beautiful showed me a place with good hearted people i community that was like a family aside from a few bullies br br anyways i recommend this movie to everyone it is one of the best i have ever seen
<START> oh yes i have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling the acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad so bad to the point that i find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor i still wonder who did the casting each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character none appear to have a true relationship family or otherwise with another the direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing were the film <UNK> asleep br br the costumes appear authentic to the <UNK> period but the <UNK> look 20th century and colors especially the blue colors are jarring and i don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in <UNK> br br also the hair the men have obvious 1970s <UNK> and the women have big hair especially the woman playing anne elliot br br all the female characters young and old are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities the actress playing anne looks as though she is in her forties while anne elliot is supposed to be 27 years old i mean where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing anne believable she spends much of her time <UNK> <UNK> with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether <UNK> or out i wonder still what that was suppose to convey regret perhaps yes this production is <UNK> br br the actress playing <UNK> was truly appalling she screams <UNK> <UNK> and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve year old my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this that i found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and <UNK> br br the actor playing captain <UNK> portrays someone so bland and <UNK> one wonders why any woman could <UNK> over him for eight years br br the of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained how did they get together again not because <UNK> was in a coma that is certain no there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film br br i rate this production two stars one because it is work and the other because some of the <UNK> scenes were lovely the only reason i could watch the entire production is that i was off sick with the <UNK> and i got it from the library br br if you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with amanda root and <UNK> <UNK> i would recommend this film even if you <UNK> read the book
<START> peter o'toole one of our finest actors is magnificent as a reserved school master who is dedicated to teaching young boys he meets a show girl and falls in love the story is one of love and devotion clark adds spirit and sensitivity not too mention a remarkable voice you will enjoy this film even though the ending might not be a happy one i enjoyed it
<START> i feel dumber after watching the first 20 min luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly not because of the budget of the film or the special effects just simply good acting and getting simple things right and most importantly not being lame but i guess this was produced for those <UNK> without taste and not a clue of what is <UNK> good be scared of rating films low save your under appreciated high scores for in a life time keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions don't spoil the <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> peace love
<START> i think that anybody whose dumb enough to risk being a wax <UNK> just so they can go to a football game or they don't want to leave their car to get stripped deserves whatever happens to them br br the guy <UNK> who went to a <UNK> and asked for the he man <UNK> wasn't my type but there's this really cute scene of him having his <UNK> and facial hair <UNK> that's a little too high <UNK> for me br br also fun but not my type is the fat guy in the big <UNK> who looks like <UNK> john only <UNK> but that whole plot goes nowhere br br blake was hot i could see myself with him if he wasn't so into his girlfriend who is a phony paris hilton in a bad wig no in her <UNK> though but that would have been really precious i don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyways nick the car thief is the <UNK> one of the best parts is where a football lands by him and instead of throwing it back he <UNK> his cigarette down and it burns the football see that's just the kind of guy he is he has a sister who looks dumb <UNK> his white wife <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> are showing for like 1 2 the movie br br mostly you will just want to wax your legs and not ever go to football games after seeing this
<START> jim performances as the <UNK> girl and a u are amazingly funny on a level <UNK> chaplin and keaton linda is great in her once in a lifetime role as the hometown <UNK> waitress longing for adventure unfortunately the remaining 90 of the movie was <UNK> bad due to the atrocious plot the makers of ernest goes to africa did not rise to the creative challenges inherent in low budget film production only worth seeing on cable
<START> what ever happened to shows with united <UNK> figures the parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children instead of <UNK> the youngest child for being manipulative they let her get away with murder they can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children and instead they do nothing yeah great plan just ignore their behavior because they're cute this show tells the already manipulative <UNK> that watch it that the <UNK> and <UNK> technique is the best way to get their parents to cave the oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations but there are no consequences for their actions yeah great television all right
<START> by the acclaimed <UNK> <UNK> is an attack on the catholic church and its loss of values it is not a visual film and i think it would have played better on the stage <UNK> takes us through this man the that lives like christ lived a true <UNK> i e in poverty and without a care for property and what the next day some might call it a parallel to <UNK> story but any <UNK> and <UNK> of the word life should be like christ in a way but in essence <UNK> also <UNK> into the <UNK> of man's <UNK> and need to sin and how goodness may save us all it is a bold statement to make that may <UNK> or <UNK> to memory the movie for some truth be told the is also selfish because he gives without wanting in return or asking for it his <UNK> is his <UNK> and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a <UNK> with the same face on each side lots of people represent sides of a <UNK> in this movie all with both faces the same but the movie isn't exactly memorable once it ends and one could attack many of its <UNK> and within the movie's own <UNK> not top notch <UNK> but a surreal dream sequence that <UNK> stages where the message of the movie is framed and is worth noting for it shows you the <UNK> of the director <UNK>
<START> sadness was the emotion i felt after the screen went dark puzzled was another why would two seasoned screen vets like matthau and lemmon sign on to this <UNK> project i'm under the impression they didn't read the script before the cameras started rolling all the cast is wasted in this unfunny uninteresting and unimpressive movie sadly enough this was one of elegant edward last projects here as the heavy <UNK> cannon tries hal <UNK> looks bored donald <UNK> <UNK> a few lines laden with profanity i'm not with the legion of decency my point is they were <UNK> purely for the <UNK> of hearing him use off color language that is a desperate attempt to <UNK> humor into a picture he actually did deliver the film's only <UNK> of entertainment when he about on the though i save my <UNK> criticism for the leads walter matthau should have known better he still delivers great solo performances iq dennis the menace etc his character although <UNK> is rather dull and one dimensional seen him once seen him all jack lemmon gives another one of his trademark <UNK> just too darn sensitive male portrayals when he starts that mode i <UNK> want to hand him a box of <UNK> out to sea is painfully unfunny and whoever produced this mess should be made to walk the <UNK>
<START> where to begin this hideous excuse for a motion picture makes plan 9 from outer space look well thought out the music it's <UNK> from every single overwrought piece of <UNK> <UNK> in existence the focus hell doesn't matter if in one shot there are thirty people standing in the road the new angle shows a lone <UNK> with a waitress posing for <UNK> shots paul le <UNK> diana <UNK> louise <UNK> wallace shawn fine actors who must have all been starving to death at that point in their lives and the director <UNK> them to sign on with <UNK> bits of cat food the production budget must have to well over fifty cents with the addition of the space alien <UNK> <UNK> machine which for a time must have meant that the oscar meyer mobile was not available when bad movies happen to good actors
<START> discovering something the journey is so much more fun so much more surreal and so much more emotionally <UNK> than when you finally arrive at the destination falling in love is perhaps one of the most <UNK> feelings in the world you feel <UNK> <UNK> and alive you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes <UNK> love and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it is pure bliss where it goes from here is anyone's guess but when you first begin your journey together nothing can compare to it br br diane lane and richard gere play <UNK> willis and dr paul two emotionally <UNK> middle aged individuals in this film they are about to <UNK> on that mystical journey together where love and the discovery of the emotions along the way will help save them br br lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex husband who still loves her but in her eyes only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him as hurt as she was by him as much as she really <UNK> him there is a part of her that is actually considering taking him back why you might ask because in life and love sometimes comfort <UNK> intelligence yes this man cheated on her but she has kids with him she built a life with him and there is obviously still a connection with him br br richard gere plays a recently divorced husband and estranged father he also just lost a patient as she <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> he is now being <UNK> by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue this is what brings him to in the first place although his lawyer told him not to he felt compelled to visit the woman's husband in he stays at the <UNK> that <UNK> is taking care of soon they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they too can have a second chance in life br br by now this sounds like a simple idea for a film and although it might be something you've seen or read about before gere and lane simply own the film diane lane lights the screen up with her smile her eyes <UNK> in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching <UNK> character is a little different he is more hardened and bitter it takes <UNK> pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was a 1 in 50 000 <UNK> but deep down it eats away at him they find each other at a time when both need someone to listen br br gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers they were married in <UNK> but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them they have a spark and a real chemistry i would love to see more films with them together in fact i'd love to see more films with diane lane but that's a story for another time br br nights in is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other they both become better people they both become stronger people i enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone not just couples this is a film about redemption <UNK> and second chances br br it will also ask you to bring some <UNK> br br 8 10
<START> i am <UNK> by actress <UNK> phillips and her superb skill as an action star this movie is <UNK> by her wonderful acting and terrific action <UNK> i am a fan of sci fi but i must say that this film <UNK> most science fiction films in it's cinematography and mostly it's of an actress whose presence <UNK> the plot which is fine but is nothing new even though it looks as though this film was made for television in my opinion it is better than most <UNK> released films of its kind
<START> it's a shame this movie didn't get more play in theatres it's a rich <UNK> love story with believable all too human characters who are too busy <UNK> and protecting their hearts to recognize the real thing when they experience it one of the most <UNK> aspects of this movie is its setting in chicago among hip artistic <UNK> middle class african americans who discuss poetry music and literature another is his royal <UNK> <UNK> and if you are even half a fan of his you need to see this film his <UNK> <UNK> and vulnerability are perfect for the role of darius long also shines as nina who <UNK> to tell darius she loves him but is afraid the break the rules a great movie to watch <UNK> up on the couch with your <UNK>
<START> although at first glance this movie looks like the story of your <UNK> high school life and many people will try to tell you that this movie is way outdated and i admit that that was my first impression but honestly the that are learned by the heroes <UNK> are <UNK> not outdated who doesn't want to be famous and who doesn't want do be accepted my their peers and the homosexual guy isn't there a whole controversy today about gay marriage blah blah this movie though released in the 80's still <UNK> some of the biggest issues in today's world this movie does have a little too much profanity and nudity for my taste though thus the 8 10 rating
<START> this is the first movie i have watched in ages where i actually ended up fast <UNK> through the tedious bits which there are plenty of very ordinary movie i'm glad i missed it at the movies got a 2 for 1 video deal which included this movie instead
<START> this isn't a life changing movie it's not an epic or anything like that but it's entertaining and it's fun it's a film that the whole family can watch together and at the moment there are precious few kid suitable films that don't have a love story in them it tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to <UNK> the audience with over the top special effects like lots of films these days are it's got some fairly good acting in and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content the acting is quite good too the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny i'd recommend it for people of all ages it certainly made me laugh
<START> this movie's basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person and that a man who likes show tunes has good taste and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual yes the movie is funny in parts but the basic premise is to <UNK> and insulting that the entire movie <UNK> into something that is quite painful to sit through the performances particularly joan <UNK> and kevin kline are very good
<START> master came with an idea in 1993 the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today passing from blue a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman's life from white a visual comedy movie about marriage and finally arriving to red a masterpiece dealing with human interaction br br while i'm not going to spoil the move i can easily say red is the best movie from the 90's decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script i have ever ever seen br br the movie begins a little slow but finds it's rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie br br the performances are perfect sublime since the characters are completely realistic and they're not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn't get disappointed seriously i believe jean louis deserved an oscar nod at least br br the music from is amazing it's one of the best musical scores ever <UNK> cinematography is also outstanding he got an oscar nod for it and deserved to win br br overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don't don't miss it br br how did the awful pulp fiction beat ed this masterpiece at cannes is beyond my <UNK>
<START> this is one of my favorite movies the performances of rip torn and <UNK> are excellent and their performances combined with the music scenery and reality of the movie are quite compelling a look at a true tell it like it is <UNK> mountain man who refuses to give up his way of life in the name of progress and development the music of the is very unique and adds an eerie quality to some of the scenes after seeing this movie for the first time i had to go out and purchase the video and the soundtrack overall a quiet type of movie with bursts of panic both torn and <UNK> are very believable in their roles i put this movie in the same category as winter people with kurt russell and kelly <UNK> another favorite
<START> me and a friends form university <UNK> lopez dave hall <UNK> we <UNK> from uk in 1997 still get together and watch b movies once a month br br we are <UNK> experts in the art of bad movie making and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful brilliant movies br br so if you've just got the beers and <UNK> in and need a film to laugh like a drain at <UNK> <UNK> aka phoenix 2 is the film for you marc singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and <UNK> it for everything he can <UNK> is sublime in his wooden acting and <UNK> is that a word as he <UNK> but i want my 20 thousand pure <UNK> gold if you liked this also see <UNK> the <UNK> and anything by charles band or fred <UNK> ray but be warned some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life
<START> as john pointed out the documentary genre can be defined like this the creative interpretation of reality br br this fabulous <UNK> minute documentary marks the first time a computer generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer br br when i saw jurassic park which i was expecting with great excitement i was left extremely disappointed of course the dinosaurs were great but the story telling was unnecessary i thought what if they made a documentary on dinosaurs with no crying children or bad <UNK> just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible to let us marvel at what was once reality br br my dream came true the bbc has produced an <UNK> documentary exploring the different <UNK> of the dinosaurs br br this part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior skin <UNK> etc of course they have to nobody was there i think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that the are all based on the of many <UNK> and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like if you wanna stick to what we know for sure then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum that is why i <UNK> the quote at the beginning of this comment br br anyway hats off to the creators of it
<START> the movie was awful the production company should be required to pay a fine for wasting electricity <UNK> this nonsense br br there were too many holes in the plot why would the send a killer out to <UNK> a world leader if they weren't the why would they send someone they thought would not do the job to quote butch cassidy who are those guys apparently the director does not know either because he never told us br br the characters were unbelievable they did not behave in any way that seemed to fit who they allegedly were with the exception of the doctor none of the characters were particularly compelling or likeable br br if you want to waste money on the electricity required to watch this movie feel free otherwise run the opposite direction
<START> this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i've ever seen it wasn't even a bad b movie i would have rated it at as a z the special effects were ridiculous <UNK> if you could even call them special effects i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head it was the box that sold the movie while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing which both is why i rented it it was a waste of not only time but money as well i didn't last long i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had <UNK> many complaints about this horrible movie my 6 year old could have done a better job filming it writing the script
<START> this movie was great and funny <UNK> is funny the best looking girl is all the way <UNK> she is totally hot in this film and she proves she can act with this film this movie is a must see comedy and its not all about <UNK> its a great movie in general but <UNK> adds the <UNK> to this film cause she does her scenes very well and she is all the way sexy
<START> i saw a 12 45 a m show last night and i would've walked out 20 min in but there was nowhere to go blatant product placement juvenile script so much talent gone to waste gay bashing what didn't they do the movie is also insanely long we got out at 3 as a person who rarely pays full price at the movies imagine my <UNK> <UNK> out 22 for this self indulgent mean spirited nightmare plus 2 parking i woke up today still feeling depressed and haven't been able to shake it all day i love vince vaughn and he seemed straight up lost in this thing as was i when cedric the entertainer is the high water mark a man so un entertaining that he has to call himself the entertainer so you'll understand what it is he thinks he's doing you have a serious problem also the appearance of robert <UNK> is down right creepy since he died almost a year ago march 10 this should give you an idea how long they've been <UNK> this turd this movie is mean to the bitter end we stayed just to make sure they didn't give robert an in <UNK> which they didn't save yourself save your money save your soul
<START> you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel is a classic but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get what a joke special effects that aren't very special horrible dialogue non acting and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and <UNK> not to mention fleeting tacked on with about a third of the movie left did i mention the story is less then lame there's no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way the rating it currently has 4 8 10 is too generous if you ask me my rating for an american werewolf in paris a 3 5 10
<START> du <UNK> <UNK> les is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are <UNK> not different from ordinary folks like us what director jules <UNK> shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them that is why they <UNK> to a strict code of honor for them a family is not only made up of wives <UNK> and children but also include casual <UNK> and close friends contrary to what many might find it hard to believe jules <UNK> has not tried to <UNK> crime in his film as <UNK> makes it clear that crime never pays it shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss apart from its philosophical stance is worth watching for its technical <UNK> while watching one of the film's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe one would find it hard to believe <UNK> <UNK> with which criminal minds <UNK> their plans this is a scene which nobody has <UNK> to copy in hollywood
<START> this movie is so god awful that it was literally a chore to watch i wanted to <UNK> it from my vcr and throw it across the room but kept thinking <UNK> that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right you lose we win <UNK> this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny after that beat them the head with this movie until the tape cracks and if you're even considering renting this turd or worse yet have i have one thing to ask of you didn't you even look at the cover i mean with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is <UNK> <UNK> this movie sucked
<START> midnight madness is the ultimate <UNK> hunt movie for all time michael j fox and paul <UNK> make respective pre fame appearances laughs abound everywhere and the intrigue of who will emerge <UNK> at the end of the great all <UNK> will keep you on the proverbial edge of your seat a true must see
<START> this is a very strange little short film that initially didn't impress me from a purely aesthetic point of view the animation here certainly ain't pretty though after a while you notice that the simple and silly drawings do possess a certain odd charm that's probably because with the script as <UNK> as this one the animation works br br the film shows an older couple sitting at the table playing <UNK> at the same time they are <UNK> on this game or other bizarre <UNK> such as the husband's <UNK> to saw things even the chair and table and all of this stuff occurs as the television warns of <UNK> atomic <UNK> <UNK> is definitely here naturally the neighbors are screaming and running amok during which time the couple <UNK> continues with this idiotic game heck even their cat knows the end is coming as the couple begin <UNK> about who may or may not have cheated leading to a very surreal ending indeed the film deserves kudos for both being unique as well as very funny while it did not win the oscar it was nominated for best animated short which it richly deserved
<START> compared to the recent gore flick hostel which this movie reminded me a lot of i would say that see no evil is slightly better but not by much the very complex plot involves a handful of <UNK> who are sent to clean up a <UNK> hotel for a shorter jail sentence the kids soon end up being killed off by a <UNK> religious psychopath who is <UNK> them of their sins i guess the one thing i <UNK> most prior to seeing this was the fact that it <UNK> a wwe wrestler kane he ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one word lines in the movie there are a couple fairly gory moments mainly involving eye <UNK> and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a <UNK> shoved down her throat probably the most effective demise in the movie br br i can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great can't recommend it
<START> on june 14 <UNK> during the russian revolution of that year sailors aboard the russian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against their oppressive officers frustrated with the second rate treatment they receive and most particularly the <UNK> <UNK> meat that they are forced to eat the <UNK> crew led by the inspirational <UNK> sailor <UNK> decide that the time is <UNK> for a revolution and so begins <UNK> m <UNK> rousing classic of russian propaganda <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> ' br br the film itself is <UNK> with shining examples of stunning visual imagery the <UNK> of an <UNK> ship captain <UNK> <UNK> from the side rope over which he had been tossed the body of a deceased <UNK> lies peaceful upon the shore the sign on his chest reading killed for a bowl of soup close up shots of the <UNK> <UNK> of the hundreds of <UNK> who are finally fed up with the regime a <UNK> baby <UNK> careers down the <UNK> steps as desperate <UNK> watch on with <UNK> breath this scene was <UNK> borrowed by brian de palma for a particularly suspenseful scene in his 'the the <UNK> of numerous <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> towards the vastly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br however the film itself is best  not as a <UNK> selection of memorable scenes  but as a single film and indeed every scene is hugely memorable though divided into five fairly distinct chapters the entire film flows <UNK> wonderfully at no point do we find ourselves losing interest and we are absolutely never in doubt of whose side we should be sympathetic towards br br the film is often referred to as propaganda and that is exactly what it is but this need not carry a negative <UNK> 'the <UNK> was produced by <UNK> with a specific purpose in mind and it <UNK> this perfectly in every way planned by the soviet central <UNK> to <UNK> with the 20th century <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> revolution was predicted to be a popular film in its home country <UNK> the of russian arts after the revolution it is somewhat unfortunate then that <UNK> film failed to perform well at the russian box office reportedly beaten by allan <UNK> <UNK> film in its opening week and running for just four short weeks luckily despite being banned on various occasions in various countries 'the <UNK> <UNK> more admirably overseas br br the film also proved a successful vehicle for <UNK> to test his theories of montage through quick cut editing and distant shots of the <UNK> of extras the audience is not allowed to <UNK> with any individual characters but with the revolutionary population in general <UNK> does briefly break this <UNK> however in a scene where <UNK> the ship officer who is trying to kill him and of course during the renowned <UNK> steps sequence as our hearts beat in horror for the life of the unfortunate child in the <UNK> baby <UNK> the accompanying soundtrack to the version i watched largely featuring the <UNK> works of <UNK> served wonderfully to <UNK> the emotional impact of such scenes br br one of the greatest films of the silent era 'the <UNK> is a triumph of phenomenal film making and is a significant slice of cinematic history the highly exaggerated events of the film among other things there was never actually any violent massacre on the <UNK> steps have so completely themselves in the memory that we're often uncertain of the true history behind the depicted events this is a grand achievement
<START> tokyo eyes tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big <UNK> who is a cop this lame flick is about 50 filler and 50 talk talk and more talk you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus talk and play video games talk and get a <UNK> talk and walk and walk and talk talk on cell phones hang out and talk etc as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen the thin <UNK> of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value a <UNK> cast and no action no romance no sex or nudity no heavy drama just <UNK> c
<START> an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects br br includes typical girl flashing her breasts denise <UNK> as she changes into her <UNK> creepy suspect any one of them could be doing the deed expected breast <UNK> to get a passing grade <UNK> <UNK> a very unusual forward pass more bare breasts a track and field event that will not be in the summer <UNK> and a <UNK> secret br br it all comes to a crashing ending no there's more won't this guy die i bet anne <UNK> <UNK> doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon br br if you like teen slasher films can you possible be a <UNK> even if all the actresses are over 18
<START> let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't get new art that being said this film is absolutely crazy and in my opinion not crazy in a good way filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories is a film for those who can look at modern art and say wow i feel the energy and passion of this painting the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film two of the characters throwing <UNK> on a lawn as to do what these characters were doing i have no idea i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody
<START> fellow giallo fanatics beware and or proceed with caution  for this movie isn't exactly what it appears to be it surely looks like a giallo with its <UNK> vhs cover showing a <UNK> naked girl and a big <UNK> knife <UNK> title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast john phillip <UNK> <UNK> but it's basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot the version i watched is presumably <UNK> <UNK>  with a running time of barely <UNK> minutes  but then still there's a severe lack of suspense character development and most of all sadistic and typically giallo carnage eyes behind the wall can briefly be <UNK> as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues it's an interesting effort notwithstanding because writer director <UNK> his only film clearly attempted to do something special but the overall result is unsatisfying and <UNK> tame inspired by hitchcock's rear window the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair bound writer he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from <UNK> on the single male tenant living across the road the tenant respectively likes to perform gym <UNK> around the house whilst being naked and clearly has <UNK> desires wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex then there's also the butler who repeatedly rapes <UNK> are there any normal characters in the story well no of course not the film <UNK> from a continuously ominous atmosphere with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography but none of it ever leads anywhere so it's all just sleaze sex without significance there's a truly bizarre twist revelation at the end of the story but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality not recommended to fans of italian horror cult cinema but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students to analyze the characters <UNK> style
<START> a couple of years before scream <UNK> the slasher horror genre with <UNK> self conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a <UNK> situation a little movie produced in russia hit the theatres without any <UNK> <UNK> br br this movie was mute witness starring a cast of <UNK> except an extremely brief cameo by sir alec <UNK> whose scenes were <UNK> filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie it told the story of a mute make up artist <UNK> who is working on a film on location in russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend andy she is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her <UNK> and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody overcome with horror she <UNK> the murderers of her presence a chase ensues and finally she is rescued by andy who take her home as they alert the police the trouble is there is no body no evidence that anything of the sort took place even so a mysterious inspector seems to be on side of the story br br and to say more would be criminal mute witness is the kind of film that demands a <UNK> of viewing similar to the most intricate clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller it's one that pays its <UNK> to movies like wait until dark and the best of hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts deadpan humor americans <UNK> in foreign countries where they are <UNK> and nail biting suspense until it seems something must snap even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing <UNK> of <UNK> but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away very smart
<START> from the opening scenes of fierce people an interplay of <UNK> customs as photographed by the <UNK> father of the young narrator <UNK> earl <UNK> why this south american tribe of is so fierce the direction of the film is <UNK> are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the new york streets to <UNK> peoples or is this a message film of a more serious intent but as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear <UNK> <UNK> direction of <UNK> <UNK> adaptation of his novel may be a bit <UNK> at times as it <UNK> from rational plot development but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to <UNK> up the holes he created br br our narrator <UNK> earl anton <UNK> lives with his coke addicted <UNK> sexually obsessed mother liz diane lane in new york waiting for the summer when he is to join his <UNK> father on a field trip to south america a father he knows only from letters and videos when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives one of <UNK> wealthy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> donald sutherland <UNK> the down and out family and moves them to his ten <UNK> estate the epitome of wealth and power in exchange for being private <UNK> liz and <UNK> can live in the mansion with the <UNK> daughter mrs <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> and <UNK> chris evans and <UNK> <UNK> stewart <UNK> and his <UNK> lead liz on the <UNK> out path and <UNK> bonds with <UNK> and his <UNK> and despite the <UNK> in poor versus wealthy the living situation works for a while incidents occur to alter feelings and <UNK> is attacked and raped by a masked <UNK> a turning point for the film and view of the <UNK> family <UNK> reveals his past to <UNK> and together they manage to discover the truth about <UNK> incident and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class br br the film uses many clips of <UNK> activity during the film drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes for this viewer that works well but when the director <UNK> to place <UNK> individuals in full <UNK> within the context of the <UNK> estate the concept feel contrived as though the audience has to be forced to <UNK> <UNK> the various subplots between maid paz de la and <UNK> and the introduction of an <UNK> retarded <UNK> artist <UNK> williams push the credibility edge of <UNK> the line between the wealthy and the but the performances by sutherland lane and <UNK> are strong enough to make us forgive the film's <UNK> not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas <UNK> around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction grady <UNK>
<START> wow i felt like i needed to shower off after watching this one but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your imagination i felt used and abused after i mean watching this film hairy <UNK> thick <UNK> and well hairy everything describes this porn horror movie but hey it was 1981 you can't call it porn in the 70s and 80s without the hair br br as a horror flick this bites but as a piece of exploitation porn from <UNK> rich cinematic history it definitely has a place in my library the copy i have is in italian with english subtitles i wish it had the really poorly dubbed english i think it would have added to the <UNK> factor that already existed the only white guy who gets laid in the movie is mark shannon he is the <UNK> wearing hairy <UNK> piece of <UNK> who really does try and give a performance every time he steps up to bat this was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic nothing like <UNK> the camera from a <UNK> backdrop to a hairy man having <UNK> style sex with a woman i can't help but laugh br br this is one of those movies that i pray my future wife and kids never find
<START> if you've been laughing too much for a long time and need to take a break br br after reading about 25 reviews of this show i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true mind of <UNK> is like a half hour version of mad tv but with somehow worse jokes br br one skit i had the <UNK> of watching was the second <UNK> stereotype <UNK> what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming or gay guy named <UNK> that wins a banana eating contest neither of these concepts is particularly novel insightful or amusing do we really need a joke about star wars every episode that movie came out like 30 years ago <UNK> solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about <UNK> and throw a few in there and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money pure comedic genius br br then he blatantly ripped off jeff <UNK> on a second show i watched with a your gay if bit you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he <UNK> in a ryan is gay joke it's not like either of those has already been done to death br br unless you're a big fan of jason <UNK> and adam <UNK> movies please stay away from this show especially when there are authentic comedians like dave out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful
<START> what <UNK> fascination with dysfunctional families made up of mean obnoxious spoiled kids and parents who are determined to be cool as opposed to being a parent i'm sorry i don't get it the one episode that i was barely able to stomach watching involved one of the kids demanding a bar with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money of course the idiot mother decides that her precious little junior has to have the biggest and <UNK> test party of all and has no problem dropping 20 grand on the big event the <UNK> brain dead boy crazy teenage daughter <UNK> back and forth between wanting to be jewish and then catholic when she <UNK> the cute religious <UNK> br br the one borderline heartwarming moment in the entire episode was when the <UNK> of a father who has been convinced the entire time that the bar is solely a money making scheme <UNK> the son studying his <UNK> lessons and is <UNK> <UNK> into thinking that perhaps his conniving <UNK> is being sincere about the right of passage into <UNK> this warm fuzzy feeling is immediately ripped out of his chest when he informs junior that since he has not yet had a <UNK> a certain <UNK> needs to be performed the bar is called off and the mother is out several thousands of dollars when the kid refuses to <UNK> br br this show is garbage and i am <UNK> that i shall never get back the 23 minutes of my life i wasted watching this piece of crap because nothing else was on tv
<START> this film was embarrassing in its clichés poor acting and generally low production values it starts out badly with the long haired 3 star general calling the hero masters major when he is obviously wearing the silver <UNK> leaves of lieutenant colonel but what was most <UNK> was the crew of soldiers on <UNK> <UNK> how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get they were all experts on flying a <UNK> and the scenes of the soldiers digging the <UNK> were beyond comical br br warning this film is dangerous to your intellectual health watch at your own peril
<START> i have just recently seen <UNK> gate after i watched this 3 <UNK> 40 min epic western that's not a western i read the book by steven bach after considering all events and the movie itself i still think this movie is a complete waste of time i believe that when someone tells you to watch it they are in fact trying to bore you to death if for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought <UNK> bad movie i have to ask why though this isn't a reason to hate it it is historically way off it pretends to be about a situation that happened in <UNK> called the johnson county war simply the cattle of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all you find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then something would happen everybody in the movie talks about things that happen and it is never shown after you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 <UNK> epic in which nothing happens oh and by the way the johnson county war was not a war it never happened the johnson county war in fact was called that because it almost happened in actual fact 2 people died i can't warn you enough off this movie however if you're like me the the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put united artists on the for sale lot sounds like an interesting case to study then by all means watch this terrible movie with no sub text and a lot of photography which is lovely sometimes
<START> recently finally available in dvd 11 11 <UNK> film and the earth did not swallow him 1994 is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in literature <UNK> <UNK> y no se lo la and the earth did not <UNK> him 1972 is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic novel originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english <UNK> novel continues as an <UNK> presence within the literary landscape br br film originally made as a highly rated american <UNK> <UNK> production has taken some time to be released in dvd one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue the film and now dvd however remains so far as i know the only cinematic adaptation of any novel and clearly is a tribute to <UNK> incredible staying power this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep <UNK> nerve that is i maintain both specifically ethnic yet also generally universal doubts about earth perhaps might have <UNK> because it is too ethnic too alien from a basic american mainstream too much a foreign art indie too limited in economic resources yet <UNK> in his version of art in my opinion <UNK> very effectively artistically and creates a <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of a <UNK> <UNK> that focuses on daily family life as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding simply viewing the film makes <UNK> this film's or dvd artistic value br br briefly  and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neo <UNK> way the plight the suffering and the despair of <UNK> <UNK> as they follow the <UNK> from south texas to <UNK> in <UNK> the local priests bless the beat up <UNK> vehicles of these <UNK> who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the <UNK> trail of the <UNK> worker this <UNK> like the depression era <UNK> in <UNK> the <UNK> of wrath forms an epic tide driven by economic need a survival instinct and <UNK> despair and ultimately a barely <UNK> faith a tribute to these people of the earth a collective hero the dvd is centered on a <UNK> family and most especially <UNK> is a young protagonist within the family a boy perhaps twelve or so this work then also functions as a ultimately the viewer's sense of <UNK> is generated through the experiences <UNK> and the struggles of the protagonist poverty alienation child labor illness and a <UNK> death <UNK> school the boy's <UNK> from the bullies of <UNK> is spent lying down in a lovely peaceful cemetery are laid bare as matter of also <UNK> worse still the <UNK> conflict between the <UNK> and his mother goes beyond <UNK> <UNK> and political conflict into deeper <UNK> of psychology and <UNK> in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle the youth battles his mother an <UNK> mexican american <UNK> a representative of god's will content with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and acceptance the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would <UNK> such evil and suffering to be visited upon them how can god be so cruel he asks since his little sister is certainly purely innocent as to come down with serious illness in the fields at this point the boy must overcome obstacles even more <UNK> than poverty and <UNK> the issues now include death doubt and despair and lack of meaning and he has few resources available to of character his own will power his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct in this desperate but artistically rendered struggle the <UNK> <UNK> the central figure feels the necessity of his enduring of his achieving a <UNK> sense of meaning and the viewer hopes a <UNK> and <UNK> life force that can serve as an inspiration to and others br br this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together missing immigrant <UNK> from mexico who leave no trace upon their death although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexican american <UNK> <UNK> a highly existential work anguish and despair a quest a focus on a project and under the <UNK> of free will in spite of the <UNK> <UNK> economic and religious circumstances br br <UNK> has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker his many awards are the producer paul is also well known and has been likewise <UNK> for his work the 1994 film in fact won and deserved a number of awards first place audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in 1995 first place at the <UNK> film festival and a number of other well deserved awards br br in my opinion this film and dvd earth by <UNK> is the best film that has been made
<START> i was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created i think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did i agree that michelle pfeiffer should have been nominated but i think all the performances were outstanding and that michelle pfeiffer and jessica lange portrayed the deep <UNK> and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity although i didn't read the book i found the modern concept of king <UNK> very cool i certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again
<START> when his elderly mother emily <UNK> bates is attacked by her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> james and turns into a <UNK> monster tv news reporter clay mark thomas miller struggles to keep dear old mom from satisfying her <UNK> br br although the above plot summary <UNK> up images of trashy over the top 80s horror titles such as <UNK> mothers and <UNK> <UNK> mom actually turns out to be a <UNK> original take on the werewolf vampire zombie <UNK> exactly what emily becomes is never really clear but it ain't nice as well as a touching study of the close bond between mother and son <UNK> devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all of his other <UNK> including his job and his relationship with pregnant girlfriend alice mary beth <UNK> whilst <UNK> love for clay ultimately drives her to self destruction br br technically the film could be <UNK> with more stylish direction and better effects the shots of the creature are kept very brief so as not to disappoint and certain more experienced members of the cast <UNK> with terribly cheesy performances yes <UNK> james and stella stevens i am referring to you fortunately however the strong emotional <UNK> in the well constructed story is enough on its own to ensure that mom is an effective compelling and occasionally shocking which i have no <UNK> in <UNK> to those looking for something a little different
<START> don't pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here it is the worst van damme film and one of the worst of any sort i have ever seen it would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than <UNK> and explosions to be entertained br br seeing that this is directed by peter it has made me realise that peter has no talent as a director but is very good at filming explosions and the like however movies need other elements as well for example a story this one didn't have one this might explain the awfulness of some of mr more recent films hardly any better than this one really br br one can't help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera
<START> anyone who <UNK> as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck just from the title it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously it's as tongue in cheek as a french kiss and just as <UNK> the female cast members are all great and fun to watch check this out <UNK> <UNK> is the clown prince of soft core horror unlike most soft core horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses the movie doesn't even attempt to follow the storyline of the robert louis stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create <UNK> sight gags and erotic situations <UNK> the brunette femme fatale who portrays the <UNK> homicidal side of <UNK> is a real <UNK> watch and enjoy
<START> this is another film where the cinematography is the best thing to recommend it that would be fine if the film were a <UNK> but as a dramatic exercise in cinematic artistry that is not good enough the theme of inter species respect and co operation <UNK> <UNK> into the forbidden world of inter species love but its approach is stereotypical <UNK> a lack of understanding of the behavior motives of either species as with many films one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter alas we probably will never know
<START> sad in every aspect this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit <UNK> wanted it to be overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved this film and <UNK> 2 are proof that <UNK> <UNK> did not have any real control over the empire strikes back connery hadn't been in a hit since he <UNK> out from bond in 1971 but this didn't bring him back at all <UNK> was released several months before this film and easily it imagine that a roger moore bond not only better than a <UNK> connery release but it and compared to never <UNK> is on par with 2001 br br the worst bond theme song even worse than the man with the golden gun pointless scenes that drag on <UNK> with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence my god who cares and the most atrocious collection of non talent as far as the <UNK> bond girls go does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this and barbara <UNK> just plain stupid but the way <UNK> has directed her to <UNK> around all the time didn't help her out any she is the that would become the very impressive which was about the best feature of <UNK> but that doesn't mean anything as you <UNK> struggle through this film br br casting as a black agent was an excellent idea but the buddy interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together witness the scene where to escape local authorities they strip to their <UNK> and pretend to be out <UNK> i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so <UNK> to get a laugh
<START> who wrote this flick an uninspired 15 year old br br could have been written by one of the kids who did the <UNK> shooting br br totally nonsensical not funny all br br plus this the french do not put their flag everywhere you do not walk into a french bank and see the flag displayed like that even on <UNK> day br br i have nothing against the blood bath thing it's just that none of this is either credible or funny or <UNK> or anything like that br br ok those who liked this flick will tell you i must be some type of fascist so forget about my comment
<START> this p of s was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great br br similar to mine taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know br br i have no idea what they saw in this movie sadistic cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie but this is a <UNK> effort trying to pass itself off as <UNK> <UNK> movie making or is it <UNK> <UNK> br br the ancient generation gap cliché no redeeming social value comes to mind bill <UNK> is trying maybe a little to hard and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame br br save yourself from this and watch a double feature of in cold blood and the <UNK> br br as somebody said this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch's daughter
<START> wow what's this on the video rental <UNK> shelf in front of me nothing other than a questionable sequel to <UNK> it wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie br br basically from the plot outline <UNK> an american <UNK> david and his fiancée <UNK> <UNK> venture into the <UNK> underworld of sex and pornography in <UNK> <UNK> to find out who is <UNK> them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute <UNK> the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex <UNK> and strip <UNK> throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end <UNK> finds out that the <UNK> money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancée which came out of her trust <UNK> money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds <UNK> the bitter end br br i didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original <UNK> at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage <UNK> over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex <UNK> throughout almost every key scene otherwise its a totally different movie it made for a lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn't believe the words coming out of david's mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble br br there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for <UNK> to figure out the plot so she can leave this <UNK> sex <UNK> i counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative br br david was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress father by getting the <UNK> they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a <UNK> phoenix <UNK> to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete <UNK> too because it wasn't even about a last breath nobody really dies but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3 4 long movie br br go rent and maybe buy the original it's one of joel <UNK> better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film i wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare <UNK> to <UNK>
<START> when jim <UNK> first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the <UNK> party massacre series i was <UNK> i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years so production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped then the <UNK> of a title change no longer would this new sequel be titled <UNK> party massacre iv but <UNK> massacre instead i was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it br br maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date a few reviews <UNK> on the net and judging by them i began to become <UNK> on jim <UNK> massacre br br tonight i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head as i read in another review <UNK> massacre is definitely not a new installment in the <UNK> party massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own and a bad one at that br br before i get into the <UNK> of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of jim films i am i always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time yes his movies are made on <UNK> budgets and don't contain the most top notch acting around but they're fun nonetheless they are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time from <UNK> house massacre ii to hard to die to <UNK> mall jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest project br br <UNK> massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films i had seen this director writer create in the past firstly the production was extremely <UNK> and the film was actually shot on <UNK> something i had never seen jim do before the actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your <UNK> old grandpa rather than an escaped lunatic br br of course the film is <UNK> with female nudity this is a jim <UNK> movie we're talking about folks but some of the <UNK> shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time there is an extremely long shower scene containing the <UNK> coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in <UNK> <UNK> house massacre ii the girl even <UNK> herself almost in the exact same way br br <UNK> massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least the opening scene is literally something we've all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks a guy and a girl making out on the verge of their relationship when you guessed it they're <UNK> to pieces br br <UNK> stevens who i've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her <UNK> and forced performances in her small cameo we're <UNK> possible cue cards here she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original <UNK> party massacre plays why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new i have no idea there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other films br br not only does this film <UNK> footage from past films but it also <UNK> the scores from other films as well some of the music used in <UNK> from the deep which was also recycled prior for the <UNK> can be heard throughout the entire film there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify but am certain have been used before br br after sitting through this film's horrendous acting ridiculous story non existent gore special effects and camcorder like quality i am having some serious concerns toward mister career has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his <UNK> only time will tell oh and let's not forget his <UNK> film a new installment in the <UNK> house massacre films now titled final <UNK> i think i'm seeing a pattern here
<START> the best of everything is a high <UNK> large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women hope lange <UNK> parker diane baker and martha <UNK> at a new york <UNK> firm what's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all br br <UNK> over this group of young is wise old <UNK> joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point br br around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband alfred steele died it was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her she inherited all of his stock in <UNK> <UNK> where he was the board <UNK> and during the same period as the best of everything was being made she wound up the queen <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> life does sometimes imitate art so that authority as she <UNK> out and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true br br in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough <UNK> it's rough for lange too but she literally makes the best of everything br br what a collection of <UNK> the men are in this film the best of them stephen <UNK> is a heavy <UNK> the others louis robert evans and brett <UNK> are as slimy a collection of <UNK> as ever gathered for one film br br i can't forget brian either who's the <UNK> <UNK> head of this <UNK> firm half that office would have sexual <UNK> suits going today br br some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat catch it by all means
<START> the reason i like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has it's a <UNK> summer camp movie so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of <UNK> pranks do take place but you get the feeling that the respective fall guys would be able to look back and laugh having been dopey enough to fall for them and without being too cheesy it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end br br it's an extra special bonus when the <UNK> of all these jolly <UNK> is bill murray for me he's still looked upon as the comedy god without <UNK> when he gets a chance to cut loose no one's better at <UNK> a sense of <UNK> wacky <UNK> without really hurting anyone the tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man established with a great opening scene showing the murray way of getting ready for the day <UNK> silly yes but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good natured fun <UNK> promises such and ultimately delivers a <UNK> watch
<START> i watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of open mind to me about how important is to care the and the wild life when i got a dog in <UNK> i called him in movie dog to never forget this movie br br by the way i have a copy this movie but is in portuguese language and the quality is not so good like a dvd or a new vhs i recorded almost 20 years ago and in <UNK> so the quality is not so good br br if somebody wish a copy i'll try <UNK> to dvd and i can send for you ok br br a great movie and i agree that is a movie to be always watched br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brazil
<START> i found it real shocking at first to see william shakespeare's love masterpiece <UNK> into a gory violent and kinky sensual movie adaptation but after you watched it once it sort of grows on you when you watch it the second and third times as you come over the shock and start <UNK> the movie on its own merits solid acting good dialogue nice <UNK> and choreography not too bad soundtrack and some of the special effects that go on oh and also the ending what a riot
<START> i first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a <UNK> which reminded me of a more innocent time the opening narrative music and paintings by norman <UNK> set the tone for me you either love the movie or hate it jan michael vincent was at his all time best and portrayed <UNK> marion in a most innocent and touching way this movie is at the top of my all time favorites a shame it isn't available on dvd or vhs anymore the ending was also wonderful john <UNK> did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time
<START> this isn't a dreadful film merely insipid the plot is deeply flawed and implausible it tries to be a number of genres and fails at each it fails as a comedy as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie it almost succeeds as science fiction the direction is uninspired and katie holmes cute <UNK> face that she is should be <UNK> teen clothing not acting the only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is helen <UNK> her performance is <UNK> <UNK> and is almost worth suffering through the rest of it her ability to from <UNK> to faux sympathetic to <UNK> manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range other than <UNK> delightful exorcist rendition <UNK> is the only reason to see this movie a solid 3 0
<START> much said without words br br this is an excellent movie it was made in color not color as in today's films but a special <UNK> color use with <UNK> that portrayed meaning mood sense and time it should be seen in color as it becomes an entirely different film the story by <UNK> prize winner <UNK> is effectively presented one never has a clear sense of real memory or phantom changes going on in swedish society at the time are subtly layered most highly recommend try to rent it or find it on line i saw it in a swedish film class and i want to add it to my film library
<START> this sounded like it was going to be like silence of the <UNK> or zodiac or something but it wasn't it really was more like one of the halloween movies without all the jump scenes it was a little like plan 9 from outer space in the sense that the main bad guy kept making inane speeches that made me want to go get a <UNK> without pushing pause the idea of a person who is so crazy that he would <UNK> people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea but the execution was too made for tv feeling i have to say it was better than i expected for a movie written and starring dee <UNK> a good first effort maybe he'll learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy
<START> if you like bad movies this one's a real treat kaufman peters <UNK> around in robot costumes escape slavery only to wander <UNK> and find true robot love i believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out i should note i was 12 and could be entertained by shiny objects
<START> hal hartley has been <UNK> to a modern day william shakespeare by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an <UNK> <UNK> he certainly knows how to <UNK> a cast and once again martin <UNK> is sensational whilst thomas jay ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable although the film is only 1 hour the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast <UNK> race right till the very end without a doubt hal hartley is one of the best directors to come out of america in the last 20 years with a vision that is unique funny and heart warming
